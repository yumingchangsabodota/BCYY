2
00:00:21,704 --> 00:00:23,511
你们好
Hello.

3
00:00:23,714 --> 00:00:26,078
我来自围墙之外
I come from outside the wall,

4
00:00:26,103 --> 00:00:29,250
在那儿 人们相互摧残
where we have all but destroyed each other.

5
00:00:31,715 --> 00:00:35,031
把你们的城市设计成实验室
We designed you city as an experiment.

6
00:00:35,056 --> 00:00:40,191
是因为坚信这是重拾人性的唯一途径
And we believe it is the only way to recover the humanity we have lost.

7
00:00:41,001 --> 00:00:45,162
我们创建了派系来维护和平
And we created Factions to ensure peace.

8
00:00:45,441 --> 00:00:47,483
但我们也相信 你们当中肯定有人
But we believe there will be those among you

9
00:00:47,508 --> 00:00:50,927
能超越这些派系
who will transcend these factions,

10
00:00:50,952 --> 00:00:53,387
他们将是分歧者
these will be the Divergent.

11
00:00:53,412 --> 00:00:56,079
是这场实验的真正目的
They are the true purpose of this experiment,

12
00:00:56,104 --> 00:01:00,533
对人类的存亡至关重要
they are vital to humanity survival.

13
00:01:00,574 --> 00:01:03,937
如果你们正在看这段视频 说明至少有一个人
If you are watching this now,then at least one of you is proof

14
00:01:03,962 --> 00:01:06,842
证明了实验是成功的
that our experiment has succeeded.

15
00:01:07,134 --> 00:01:08,612
是时候
The time has come

16
00:01:08,654 --> 00:01:11,713
从你们封闭的城市里走出来了 加入我们吧
for you to emerge from your isolation and rejoin us.

17
00:01:11,738 --> 00:01:14,995
奉伊芙琳之令 马上关闭城门
On Evelyn's orders:This gate is now closed!

18
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:18,478
我们曾让你们相信自己是最后的幸存者
We've allowed you to believe that you’re the last of us,

19
00:01:18,503 --> 00:01:20,661
其实不是
but you’re not.

20
00:01:20,931 --> 00:01:26,813
其他人类正在围墙外满怀希望地等待着你们
Mankind waits for you with hope,beyond the Wall.

21
00:01:27,485 --> 00:01:30,799
<i>分歧者3：忠诚世界</i>

22
00:01:54,632 --> 00:01:56,693
我们快到了
We're almost there.

23
00:01:57,514 --> 00:01:59,742
对 我在你后面
Yeah, I'm right behind you.

24
00:02:00,366 --> 00:02:02,472
我说你不会恐高吧
What are you,afraid of heights?

25
00:02:02,497 --> 00:02:05,561
不 谁跟你说的
No.Who told you that?

26
00:02:12,229 --> 00:02:14,774
有时候我朝围墙外面看
Sometimes when I look past the wall,

27
00:02:14,799 --> 00:02:17,824
感觉自己能看到外面的东西
I think that I can see something out there.

28
00:02:18,366 --> 00:02:19,612
你呢
Do you?

29
00:02:19,637 --> 00:02:22,275
我 看不到
No.I don't.

30
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:24,318
也许你得看仔细点儿
Maybe you need to look harder.

31
00:02:24,343 --> 00:02:26,012
我正看着呢
I am looking.

32
00:02:26,037 --> 00:02:28,477
可还是什么都看不到
I'm just not seeing what you see.

33
00:02:28,517 --> 00:02:31,294
如果在眼前 你就看到了
When it's right in front of your face, you will.

34
00:02:32,457 --> 00:02:34,768
我们真的要离开吗
You sure we're going to do this?

35
00:02:37,283 --> 00:02:38,725
对
Yeah.

36
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:56,437
芝加哥的全体公民
People of Chicago,

37
00:02:56,462 --> 00:02:59,731
我知道你们很好奇围墙外面有什么
I know you are curious about what's beyond the wall,

38
00:02:59,756 --> 00:03:02,860
但有的时候围墙是在保护我们
but sometimes walls are there to protect us.

39
00:03:02,885 --> 00:03:07,074
记住 正是那些创建者把我们划分成了若干派系
Remember, the founders were the ones who divided us into Factions.

40
00:03:07,099 --> 00:03:12,190
所以在我们不知道他们的真实目的前 城门必须关闭
So, until we know their intentions,the wall must stay closed.

41
00:03:12,222 --> 00:03:13,921
珍宁已经死了
Jeanine is dead.

42
00:03:13,946 --> 00:03:17,278
今天 我们要开始审判她的同谋者
Today, we begin the trials of her conspirators.

43
00:03:17,303 --> 00:03:20,043
审判叛徒 关闭城门
Put the traitors on trial,close down the gate.

44
00:03:20,068 --> 00:03:22,778
没想到 她这么快就走上了珍宁的老路
Didn't take her long to make the same mistakes as Jeanine.

45
00:03:22,803 --> 00:03:24,805
我得和她谈谈
I need to talk to her.

46
00:03:25,065 --> 00:03:27,459
我想我能劝她回头
I still think I can bring her around.

47
00:03:28,223 --> 00:03:31,080
但那改变不了任何事
But that doesn't change anything, right?.

48
00:03:31,254 --> 00:03:32,874
不
No.

49
00:03:39,423 --> 00:03:41,815
我要你帮我弄点儿东西
I need you to get somethings for me.

50
00:03:45,787 --> 00:03:46,854
就这个
Just this?

51
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:49,206
确定不再摘个太阳月亮什么的
You sure you don't want the sun and moon as well?

52
00:03:49,231 --> 00:03:51,856
- 我知道这很困难  - 简直是不可能
- I know it's a lot. - It's impossible.

53
00:03:51,881 --> 00:03:55,220
- 所以  - 所以只有我能搞定
- So? - So, I'll make it happen.

54
00:04:06,994 --> 00:04:08,411
你们好 女士们
Well.Hello, ladies.

55
00:04:08,436 --> 00:04:09,647
要去哪儿 能一起吗
Where are we going?Can I come?

56
00:04:09,672 --> 00:04:11,950
- 滚远点儿 皮特  - 太不友好了
- Give it up, Peter. - Why so hostile!

57
00:04:11,975 --> 00:04:14,369
派系都没了 我们能成朋友了 对吗
There's no faction.We can be friends, right?

58
00:04:14,394 --> 00:04:16,706
难道就不能相亲相爱吗
Can't we all just get along?

59
00:04:18,020 --> 00:04:19,856
翠丝
Tris.

60
00:04:21,793 --> 00:04:25,279
你应该上去跟其他领导者在一起
Your should be up there with all the other leaders of the city.

61
00:04:25,304 --> 00:04:28,294
不 我可不想 去制定什么规矩
No, it's not me.I don't want to make the rules.

62
00:04:28,295 --> 00:04:32,537
伟大的领导者从不追逐权力 他们被社会需求所召唤
Great leaders don't seek power,they're called by necessity.

63
00:04:32,562 --> 00:04:34,558
人们需要你
They need you.

64
00:04:51,905 --> 00:04:54,602
看着我 你这个叛徒
Look at me!Look at me, traitor!

65
00:04:54,627 --> 00:04:56,090
- 准备好去死了吗  - 后退
- You're going to die in there! - Back up.

66
00:04:56,115 --> 00:04:58,692
准备好去死了吗
You're going to die in there!

67
00:05:00,593 --> 00:05:02,010
快走
Move!

68
00:05:02,504 --> 00:05:04,127
待在这儿
Sit tight.

69
00:05:06,907 --> 00:05:09,947
我们都在新环境中找到了自己
We all find ourselves on new ground.

70
00:05:10,411 --> 00:05:15,657
我毕生的志愿就是追寻真相 但珍宁却让我错过了它
I dedicated my life to seeking the truth,but under Jeanine, it passed me by.

71
00:05:15,682 --> 00:05:19,548
为此 我真诚向诸位道歉
And for that,I humbly apologize.

72
00:05:25,488 --> 00:05:30,946
但是我失败的教训 更坚定了我纠正自己错误的决心
But my personal failure has only strengthened my resolve to make things right.

73
00:05:32,322 --> 00:05:35,687
即使现在诚实派不复存在了
While the Faction of Candor may no longer exist,

74
00:05:35,712 --> 00:05:40,102
我也想让大家知道 我不会停下追求真相的脚步
I want everyone to know that I will not stop leading the pursuit of honesty,

75
00:05:40,127 --> 00:05:42,621
让我们携起手来 重建家园
as we rebuild our city.

76
00:05:42,646 --> 00:05:44,836
- 好  - 好
- Yay! - Yay!

77
00:05:47,726 --> 00:05:51,683
审判现在开始 让我们来伸张正义
Let the trials begin!Justice will be done!

78
00:05:51,708 --> 00:05:53,496
- 好  - 好
- Yay! - Yay!

79
00:05:56,266 --> 00:05:57,666
来吧
Here.

80
00:06:01,317 --> 00:06:03,838
愿真相让你解脱
May the truth set you free.

81
00:06:08,619 --> 00:06:11,829
毫无疑问 你协助珍宁接管了芝加哥
There's no doubt, Max, that you helped Jeanine take over Chicago,

82
00:06:11,854 --> 00:06:15,380
对人民进行了残忍的控制
and exert brutal control over it's citizens.

83
00:06:15,554 --> 00:06:18,218
我唯一想问的就是你觉得
So, my only question to you is this.

84
00:06:19,277 --> 00:06:23,558
屠杀人民去支持她的政权是否正确
Did you feel justified in murdering people in support of her regime?

85
00:06:24,816 --> 00:06:26,861
当然正确
Absolutely.

86
00:06:27,156 --> 00:06:32,107
人民是绵羊 他们需要牧羊人引导
People are sheep.They need a shepherd to guide them.

87
00:06:32,132 --> 00:06:36,836
如果他们反抗 就该被杀
And when they resist,they're slaughtered.

88
00:06:37,905 --> 00:06:38,870
禽兽
Monster.

89
00:06:38,895 --> 00:06:40,593
我们应该杀了你
We should slaughter you!

90
00:06:40,618 --> 00:06:47,359
杀了他
Kill him!Kill him!

91
00:06:52,856 --> 00:06:55,484
- 杀了他  - 别杀他
- Kill him! - Don't kill him!

92
00:06:55,509 --> 00:06:57,146
- 别杀他  - 杀了他
- Let him live! - Kill him!

93
00:06:57,171 --> 00:06:59,476
- 别杀他  - 杀了他
- Let him live! - Kill him now!

94
00:06:59,501 --> 00:07:00,908
理智点儿
Rise above it.

95
00:07:00,933 --> 00:07:02,439
你们不能这样做 快停下来
You can't do this, stop it!

96
00:07:02,464 --> 00:07:04,721
别杀他 我们跟那些杀人犯不一样
Let him live!We're better than this!

97
00:07:04,746 --> 00:07:06,942
理智点儿
Rise above it.

98
00:07:13,305 --> 00:07:15,377
珍宁
Jeanine!

99
00:07:15,769 --> 00:07:18,128
珍宁已经死了
Jeanine is dead!

100
00:07:19,106 --> 00:07:21,326
我们不能再重蹈覆辙了
Let's not keep her spirit alive.

101
00:07:21,351 --> 00:07:24,568
- 杀了他  - 别杀他
- Kill him! - Let him live!

102
00:07:27,563 --> 00:07:31,776
现在怎么办 得给他们个交代
What are you going to do?They need an answer.

103
00:07:38,234 --> 00:07:40,213
这是一场杀戮
This is an execution.

104
00:07:40,238 --> 00:07:43,769
不 这是一场审判
No.This is a trial.

105
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:48,893
我服从全体公民的意愿
And I yield,to the wishes of the people.

106
00:07:50,062 --> 00:07:54,576
是时候打破历史的牢笼了
It is time,that we break from the past!

107
00:07:54,601 --> 00:07:58,460
好
Yay! 

108
00:08:17,363 --> 00:08:19,673
杀了他
You need to die!

109
00:08:35,311 --> 00:08:37,600
我还不想死
I don't want to die.

110
00:08:37,625 --> 00:08:40,197
你杀的人也不想
Neither did your sheep.

111
00:08:50,024 --> 00:08:51,550


112
00:08:52,968 --> 00:08:58,382
过去我说过 我愿你们活在爱里 而不是恨里
There was a time I would have said:I leave you with love, not malice.

113
00:08:59,457 --> 00:09:01,710
看来过去已经过去了
That time has passed.

114
00:09:07,392 --> 00:09:10,008
- 杀了她  - 叛徒
- Kill her!  - Traitor!

115
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:13,682
杀了她
Kill her!Kill her!

116
00:09:14,069 --> 00:09:15,297
叛徒
Traitor!

117
00:09:15,322 --> 00:09:18,055
出去
Get out! Out!Get out! Out!

118
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:20,094
出去
Get out!Out!

119
00:09:20,119 --> 00:09:23,922
碧翠丝 对不起
Beatrice!I'm sorry!

120
00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:29,851
你煽动了民众 但愿你能掌控得住
You incited a mob.Good luck controlling them.

121
00:09:32,747 --> 00:09:36,372
碧翠丝 求你了 别让他们杀了我
Beatrice, please!Don't let them kill me!

122
00:09:36,397 --> 00:09:38,526
碧翠丝 不
Beatrice!No!

123
00:09:39,145 --> 00:09:40,930
碧翠丝
Beatrice!

124
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:47,530
你知道你在做什么吗 我们得表现得团结一致
What the hell did you think you're doing?We need to show a united front.

125
00:09:47,531 --> 00:09:50,296
尤其是在碧翠丝拒绝跟我们同一阵营之后
Especially, since Tris refuses to stand with us.

126
00:09:50,297 --> 00:09:53,382
- 我不会告诉她 她该干什么  - 你得试着跟她说
- I'm not going to tell Tris what to do. - Well, you need to try!

127
00:09:53,383 --> 00:09:58,373
你真的认为自己能阻止人们离开这座城市吗
Do you really think that you can stop people leaving this city?

128
00:09:58,398 --> 00:10:01,451
城门现在已经锁上了 我的士兵们听从我的
The wall's on total lock down,my soldiers have orders.

129
00:10:01,476 --> 00:10:03,807
没人能出去
No one gets out.

130
00:10:08,241 --> 00:10:10,694
你为什么要跟珍宁开战
Why did you go to war with Jeanine,

131
00:10:11,636 --> 00:10:13,917
难道只是想变成她
if you were just going to become her?

132
00:10:17,464 --> 00:10:21,643
领导者们为了保护人民需要作出艰难的决定
Leaders need to make tough decisions to protect their people.

133
00:10:24,249 --> 00:10:27,665
等你继承了我的位置自然就会明白了
You'll understand that when you take over from me.

134
00:10:39,003 --> 00:10:41,454
我这都是为了你
I'm doing this for you.

135
00:11:00,570 --> 00:11:03,333
现在可能不是离开的最佳时机
You know, it might not be the best time to leave.

136
00:11:03,407 --> 00:11:06,168
那也不能待在这儿解决所有冲突
I know, but we can't be here for every fight.

137
00:11:06,193 --> 00:11:09,246
信息里也说要走出去面对新世界
And the message said to come out and meet the rest of the world .

138
00:11:09,271 --> 00:11:12,253
可我们对传递信息的人一无所知
Yet, we know absolutely nothing about the people who sent it.

139
00:11:12,254 --> 00:11:14,843
那你就不想把她找出来吗
Aren't you curious to find out?

140
00:11:15,831 --> 00:11:17,985
我们的家园怎么办
What about our home?

141
00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:22,454
我觉得我们的家园已经不复存在了
I don't think our home exist any more.

142
00:11:22,764 --> 00:11:25,271
也许走出去反而能够帮到芝加哥
Maybe the way to help Chicago is climb beyond the wall.

143
00:11:25,296 --> 00:11:28,972
可万一外面什么都没有 荒芜一片呢
What if there's nothing out there?What If there is nothing left?

144
00:11:29,631 --> 00:11:34,568
只要你在我就能活下去 但你必须得让我试一试
I can live with that if you are with me,but I can not live without trying.

145
00:11:39,304 --> 00:11:41,442
你知道明天要审凯莱布吧
You know, it's Caleb's trial tomorrow.

146
00:11:41,467 --> 00:11:43,173

147
00:11:46,935 --> 00:11:50,028
可我没觉得有什么欠他的
 I don't owe him anything.

148
00:11:50,615 --> 00:11:54,173
没错 你不欠他
No.No, you don't.

149
00:12:29,092 --> 00:12:31,234
我来处理这个人
I'm going to deal with this one.

150
00:12:32,885 --> 00:12:35,288
你觉得我是在请求你吗
Do you think I'm asking your permission?

151
00:12:40,355 --> 00:12:42,438
不 求你了 老四 不要

老四 对不起

155
00:12:49,462 --> 00:12:53,539

You tried to kill your own sister, Caleb.You brought this on yourself.

156

- Beatrice? - Walk slowly.

160
00:13:30,999 --> 00:13:32,539
嘿
Hey!

161
00:13:33,489 --> 00:13:36,799
所有博学派的犯人都应关在牢里
All Erudite prisoners are suppose to be locked in the cages.

162
00:13:36,824 --> 00:13:38,282
站住
Stop!

163
00:13:41,192 --> 00:13:43,689
我自己能处理这个人
I can handle this one myself.

164
00:14:02,626 --> 00:14:04,396
带他们进来
Bring him in!

165
00:14:08,071 --> 00:14:10,411
你现在能出来了
You can come out now, Caleb.

谢谢你 老四 谢谢

167

168

我没接到任何转移犯人的通知

You're being decontaminated from the toxins which plague our world.

275
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:54,802
请把你们的衣服脱了 然后丢进焚化炉
Please remove your clothes and place them in the incineration hatch.

276
00:31:23,031 --> 00:31:24,853
上前一步
Please step forward.

277
00:31:32,046 --> 00:31:34,041
站在标记上
Place your feet on the mark.

278
00:32:13,180 --> 00:32:14,286
搞定了
You're clean.

279
00:32:14,311 --> 00:32:17,033
请把手放进墙上的孔道里
Please place your arm into the tube in the wall.

280
00:32:21,986 --> 00:32:24,305
不用有任何顾虑 翠丝
There's nothing to worry about, Tris.

281
00:32:24,330 --> 00:32:26,768
请把手放进孔道里
Please place your arm into the tube.

282
00:32:47,436 --> 00:32:49,184
这辈子都没这么干净过
I've never felt so clean in my life.

283
00:32:49,224 --> 00:32:52,004
这是我洗过的最奇怪的澡了
That was the best weird shower I've ever had.

284
00:32:52,029 --> 00:32:53,845
有点儿冷 但是
A little cold thou.

285
00:32:53,870 --> 00:32:55,796
你的文身不一样
Hey, yours is different.

286
00:32:57,898 --> 00:32:59,873
为什么都不一样
Why they are all different?

287
00:33:09,117 --> 00:33:13,275
你们好 欢迎各位光临基因福利局
Hello, and welcome to the Bureau of Genetic Welfare.

288
00:33:13,300 --> 00:33:18,541
在21世纪上半叶 科学家们首次发现并绘制了
In the early part of the 21st century,scientists first discovered a way to map

289
00:33:18,566 --> 00:33:21,677
改变人类基因组的方法
then edit the human genome.

290
00:33:22,494 --> 00:33:27,574
你能选择保持自身的基因组 也能选择改善它们
You can choose to settle from "merely adequate" or you can choose "excellent".

291
00:33:27,599 --> 00:33:31,018
基因解决方案让你可以掌控自己的生命
A genetic solution puts you in control of your life.

292
00:33:31,043 --> 00:33:36,093
为什么不期待一个更美好的未来 当你有机会选择完美时
So, why just hope for a better future,when you can choose perfection?

293
00:33:36,118 --> 00:33:38,366
请选择蒲飞霞
Choose Perfexia.

294
00:33:38,391 --> 00:33:41,691
但是正如试图清除人类的缺陷一样
But, what started as an attempt to erase humanity's fault,

295
00:33:41,716 --> 00:33:44,265
人性也几乎被抹杀了
almost erased humanity itself.

296
00:33:44,290 --> 00:33:47,381
基因改造加剧了人们之间的分歧
Genetic modification deepened the rifts between people.

297
00:33:47,406 --> 00:33:50,640
当矛盾越来越深 世界便开始四分五裂
And as they got more entrenched,the world began to tear apart,

298
00:33:50,665 --> 00:33:55,749
人类也因无法恢复原始基因 而变得无可挽救
until humanity crossed a line,from which it could never return.

299
00:33:56,700 --> 00:33:58,616
在这片文明的废墟上
In the ashes of civilization,

300
00:33:58,641 --> 00:34:05,834
一小群基因未被改造的人 建立了你们今天所在的这个基因福利局
a small group of genetically unmodified individuals established the "BUREAU OF GENETIC WELFARE."

301
00:34:05,859 --> 00:34:09,137
在这儿 芝加哥的奥黑尔机场
here in Chicago's O'Hare Airport.

302
00:34:09,162 --> 00:34:12,276
我们的任务是监控一项重要的实验
Our mission is to oversee a grand experiment

303
00:34:12,301 --> 00:34:14,593
其目的就是净化人类的基因组
to purify the human genome.

304
00:34:14,618 --> 00:34:18,281
而实验室就是芝加哥市
That experiment is the city of Chicago.

305
00:34:18,306 --> 00:34:23,954
你们参与到了基因局的工作 就意味着成为了人类未来的守护者
Your participation in the Bureau's work means you are now the guardians of the future.

306
00:34:23,979 --> 00:34:27,248
你们的使命从今天开始
Your destiny begins today.

307
00:34:30,688 --> 00:34:33,739
现在请跟我来
Now.Please follow me.

308
00:34:43,430 --> 00:34:45,719
机场是什么鬼
What's an airport?

309
00:34:49,358 --> 00:34:51,360
在这儿生活限制很多
Life in the Bureau can be demanding.

310
00:34:51,385 --> 00:34:53,947
但是我们值得为此付出
The work is worth every sacrifice.

311
00:34:53,972 --> 00:34:55,892
基因局并不是要什么就有什么
We don't have all the resources we would like of course,

312
00:34:55,917 --> 00:34:57,900
但足以满足你们的基本生活
but I think you'll find your accommodations more than adequate

313
00:34:57,925 --> 00:34:58,985


314
00:34:59,010 --> 00:35:00,358
他们是真人啊
They're in person, here.

315
00:35:00,383 --> 00:35:02,734
- 他们是谁  - 从边界带回来的
- Who are they? - We bring them in from the Fringe.

316
00:35:02,759 --> 00:35:05,560
等他们治好了 就能活下去了
Get them healthy.Give them a second chance.

317
00:35:05,585 --> 00:35:07,392
老四
Hi, Four.

318
00:35:07,417 --> 00:35:08,523
老四
Hi, Four.

319
00:35:08,548 --> 00:35:09,841
嗨
Hey.

320
00:35:10,277 --> 00:35:12,263
他们怎么知道我们的
Now they know who we are.

321
00:35:12,288 --> 00:35:14,760
实验室是整个基因局的焦点
The experiment is the entire focus of the Bureau.

322
00:35:14,785 --> 00:35:19,024
我们的监控技术领先你们芝加哥几个世纪
Our Surveillance Technology is centuries ahead of anything you know in Chicago.

323
00:35:19,548 --> 00:35:21,683
他们看着你们长大
They grown up watching you.

324
00:35:21,708 --> 00:35:24,054
你可吓着我们了
Nothing creepy about that.

325
00:35:24,629 --> 00:35:27,122
请原谅所有人都盯着你们看
You have to forgive everyone for staring, but...

326
00:35:27,147 --> 00:35:30,837
但你们的到来对我们来说是件大事
your arrival is the most exciting event some of us have ever known.

327
00:35:31,827 --> 00:35:33,925
欢迎来到新家
Welcome to your new home.

328
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:39,999
老四在哪儿 伤着他了吗
Where's Four?Did you hurt him?

329
00:35:40,024 --> 00:35:41,683
我说过我要他们几个毫发无损
I told you I wanted them unharmed.

330
00:35:41,708 --> 00:35:44,259
跟他们走了 是自愿的
He went with them.Willing.

331
00:35:44,284 --> 00:35:47,522
- 他还活着吗  - 你没听懂吗
- But he's alive. - Did you hear what I'm saying?

332
00:35:47,547 --> 00:35:49,395
他背叛了你
He betrayed you.

333
00:35:49,689 --> 00:35:51,100
不
No...

334
00:35:51,125 --> 00:35:53,773
- 都是因为爱情  - 他是你儿子
- It's just love. - He's your son.

335
00:35:53,798 --> 00:35:55,725
他应该忠诚 像我这样
He should be loyal.I'm loyal!

336
00:35:55,750 --> 00:35:57,502
没错 你很忠诚
Yes, you are!

337
00:35:57,527 --> 00:36:01,137
去休息吧 我要你做好战斗准备
So, rest up.I need you ready to fight.

338
00:36:06,743 --> 00:36:08,474
想什么呢
What do you think?

339
00:36:11,375 --> 00:36:15,302
他们研究了我们200年 我们得迎头赶上
I think they've been studying us for 200 years and we need to catch up.

340
00:36:17,670 --> 00:36:20,287
我们得抓住机会 对吗
We're going to give it a chance, right?

341
00:36:20,497 --> 00:36:23,935
没错 完全正确
Yep,of course we are.

342
00:36:27,759 --> 00:36:29,814
真想单约你
I wish we were alone.

343
00:36:33,557 --> 00:36:37,061
打扰一下 我们头儿说要见你
Excuse me.The Director's ready to see you.

344
00:36:39,590 --> 00:36:42,878
不 对不起 我说的是翠丝
No, I'm sorry.I mean Tris, alone.

345
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:45,693
不能一起去吗
We can't go together?

346
00:36:45,718 --> 00:36:48,616
因为你是那个打开盒子的人
Since you were the one who opened the box which invited you here.

347
00:36:48,641 --> 00:36:51,357
所以我们头儿想亲自感谢你
The Director would like to thank your personal.

348
00:36:53,788 --> 00:36:55,536
一会儿见
I'll see you later.

349
00:37:02,422 --> 00:37:04,267
- 衣服  - 谢谢
- Clothes. - Thanks.

350
00:37:04,292 --> 00:37:05,893
这边请
This way.

351
00:37:30,337 --> 00:37:33,022
来吧 手腕放在扫描仪上
Go ahead.Put your wrist under the scanner.

352
00:37:33,047 --> 00:37:35,447
<font color="#ff80ff">允许 进入</font>
<font color="#ff80ff">Access granted.</font>

353
00:37:44,463 --> 00:37:46,168
<font color="#ff80ff">纯净</font>
<font color="#ff80ff">Pure.</font>

354
00:38:48,420 --> 00:38:51,685
我从没想过还有比芝加哥大的地方
I just never imagined the world to be this big.

355
00:38:52,822 --> 00:38:56,966
在北美 芝加哥只是过去50个大城市
Chicago is just one of 50 major cities that used to exist

356
00:38:56,991 --> 00:38:58,666
之中的一个
on this continent along.

357
00:38:58,691 --> 00:39:03,222
除此之外 还有一望无际的海洋和广袤的大陆
Beyond that is, oceans and more land than you can imagine.

358
00:39:04,272 --> 00:39:06,475
现在都变样了
But it's all like this now?

359
00:39:07,688 --> 00:39:09,189
对
Yeah.

360
00:39:10,379 --> 00:39:12,549
除了普罗维登斯
All except for Providence.

361
00:39:12,850 --> 00:39:16,025
所以我们在这儿做的事非常重要 翠丝
Which is why what we're doing here is so important, Tris.

362
00:39:57,172 --> 00:39:58,803
你好
Hello.

363
00:39:59,266 --> 00:40:03,121
- 你一定是头儿了  - 拜托 叫我大卫
- You must be director. - Oh, please call me David.

364
00:40:03,146 --> 00:40:05,899
很高兴我终于见到你了
It is a pleasure to finally meet you.

365
00:40:05,924 --> 00:40:08,651
你一定有很多的疑问
You must have so many questions.

366
00:40:10,414 --> 00:40:13,666
我有点儿不知所措 我还在试着理解
I'm a bit overwhelmed.I'm still processing it and all.

367
00:40:13,691 --> 00:40:16,600
翠丝 我了解你
Oh.Tris, I know you.

368
00:40:16,625 --> 00:40:18,160
你一出生我就在观察你
I watched you being born.

369
00:40:18,185 --> 00:40:21,712
我看到了你父母对你的爱
I saw the love that your mother and father had for you.

370
00:40:21,929 --> 00:40:26,629
看到了一个拥有幸福童年的小姑娘是如何成长为
I watched a little girl have a happy childhood and grow into a courageous young woman

371
00:40:26,654 --> 00:40:28,769
一名勇敢而果断的女孩
capable of making choices.

372
00:40:28,794 --> 00:40:31,215
加入无畏派 推翻珍宁
Dauntless.Defying Jeanine.

373
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:33,159
拯救芝加哥
Saving Chicago.

374
00:40:33,184 --> 00:40:35,437
对人民你是分歧者
To your people,you are a divergent.

375
00:40:35,462 --> 00:40:38,397
对委员会 你是怪胎
To the Council, you're a freak.

376
00:40:38,422 --> 00:40:42,321
对我 你就是个奇迹
To me,you are a a miracle.

377
00:40:44,495 --> 00:40:47,771
大卫 你注意到芝加哥现在发生的事了吗
David. are you-are you aware what's happening in Chicago right now?

378
00:40:47,796 --> 00:40:50,126
注意到了 当然
Of Course.Yes.

379
00:40:50,206 --> 00:40:52,290
博学派的人真是够可以的
The people at Erudite really made a mess of things,

380
00:40:52,315 --> 00:40:53,946
但我不想你为这些担心
but I don't want your to worry about that.

381
00:40:53,971 --> 00:40:58,967
恢复芝加哥的秩序对你和我都很重要
Restoring order in Chicago is as important to me as it is to you.

382
00:40:58,992 --> 00:41:01,726
这是拯救缺陷者的唯一办法
It's the only way to save the "damaged".

383
00:41:01,927 --> 00:41:03,160
什么是缺陷者
What is the "damaged".

384
00:41:03,185 --> 00:41:06,332
基因改造产生了严重的后果
The genetic alterations had disastrous consequences.

385
00:41:06,357 --> 00:41:09,841
太勇敢会变得残忍 太平和会变得懦弱
Too brave and you're cruel.Too peaceful and you're passive.

386
00:41:09,866 --> 00:41:13,689
太聪明会变得冷酷 就像你哥哥
Too smart, and you'll lose compassion,like your brother.

387
00:41:13,714 --> 00:41:16,897
- 凯莱布是缺陷者吗  - 没错
- Caleb's "damaged"? - Yes.

388
00:41:16,922 --> 00:41:18,197
近200年来
For nearly 200 years,

389
00:41:18,222 --> 00:41:22,165
顶尖的科学家们在这儿验证一个理论
 the greatest scientific minds have lived here to test a theory.

390
00:41:22,189 --> 00:41:24,342
如果我们能把边界地带
If we can rescue genetically damaged people

391
00:41:24,367 --> 00:41:26,162
有毒环境中的基因缺陷者
from the toxic environment in the Fringe.

392
00:41:26,187 --> 00:41:28,505
放在像芝加哥这样安全的城市里
and put them in a safe place like Chicago,

393
00:41:28,530 --> 00:41:33,087
也许久而久之 人们的基因就能治愈自己
then perhaps over time,man's genetic material would heal itself.

394
00:41:33,112 --> 00:41:35,374
这样就可以回到原来的样子了
Return to its original form.

395
00:41:35,399 --> 00:41:37,660
我就是其中的一个
And I'm one of those people?

396
00:41:38,913 --> 00:41:41,001
你是唯一的一个
You're the only one.

397
00:41:41,915 --> 00:41:44,181
你这么说没道理 我是说
That doesn't- That doesn't make any sense

398
00:41:44,205 --> 00:41:46,514
老四也是分歧者 还有很多分歧者
Four is divergent.There's lot of divergences.

399
00:41:46,539 --> 00:41:48,360
不是分歧者 翠丝 是纯净者
Not divergent, Tris.Pure.

400
00:41:48,385 --> 00:41:52,113
你是基因纯净者 其他人都是缺陷者
You're genetically "pure".The rest are still "damaged".

401
00:41:52,138 --> 00:41:54,733
- 老四呢  - 缺陷者
- Four? - Damaged.

402
00:41:54,856 --> 00:41:58,033
不像凯莱布那么严重 但也是缺陷者
Not as much as Caleb,but "damaged".

403
00:41:58,058 --> 00:42:00,652
如果我们能知道是什么治愈了你
If we can understand what made you,

404
00:42:00,677 --> 00:42:03,927
也许我们就能帮助其他的缺陷者了
maybe we can use that knowledge to help the "damaged".

405
00:42:06,697 --> 00:42:09,221
但这跟芝加哥有什么关系
What does this have to do with Chicago?

406
00:42:09,664 --> 00:42:11,179
我会向委员会汇报
I answer to the Council.

407
00:42:11,204 --> 00:42:13,234
他们是最终决定我们命运的人
They're the ones who ultimately determine our fate.

408
00:42:13,259 --> 00:42:15,368
你们的和我的
Yours and mine.

409
00:42:15,812 --> 00:42:18,771
我准备带你去见他们
I'm going to bring you with me to Providence to meet them.

410
00:42:18,804 --> 00:42:23,132
当他们看见这是有可能的 你就是那个可能性
When they see that it's possible,that you were possible,

411
00:42:23,157 --> 00:42:25,027
一切都会改变
it will change everything.

412
00:42:25,052 --> 00:42:28,100
我明白我的话很难得到信任
I understand it's hard to take my word for it.

413
00:42:28,125 --> 00:42:32,113
但是如果你不相信我 就相信你母亲
But, if you don't believe me,believe your mother.

414
00:42:33,235 --> 00:42:34,249
我母亲
My mother?

415
00:42:34,274 --> 00:42:37,123
你母亲娜塔莉不是出生在芝加哥
Your mother, Natalie,wasn't born in Chicago.

416
00:42:37,148 --> 00:42:41,328
她出生在边界地带 然后被基因局救了
She was born in the Fringe and rescued by the Bureau.

417
00:42:42,813 --> 00:42:45,367
不 这根本不可能
No, that's impossible.

418
00:42:45,624 --> 00:42:47,768
眼见为实
See for yourself.

419
00:42:59,072 --> 00:43:00,964
这是什么
What are these?

420
00:43:01,159 --> 00:43:03,474
这是你母亲的记忆卡
They're your mother's memory tabs.

421
00:43:03,499 --> 00:43:06,891
有了这些你就能通过她的眼睛去看世界
With them, you can watch the world through her eyes.

422
00:43:13,037 --> 00:43:14,662
我该怎么做
What do I do?

423
00:43:14,687 --> 00:43:17,104
在太阳穴上各放一枚
Place one on each temple.

424
00:43:28,812 --> 00:43:31,171
娜塔莉 快点儿
Natalie, come on!

425
00:43:31,453 --> 00:43:32,764
我不是娜塔莉
I'm not Natalie.

426
00:43:32,789 --> 00:43:35,291
我们得藏起来 快点儿
We need to hide!Come on!

427
00:44:02,388 --> 00:44:04,648
他们来了 快跑
They're coming!Run!

428
00:44:05,293 --> 00:44:07,419
是边界掠夺者
The Fringers!

429
00:44:07,541 --> 00:44:09,237
快跑
Run!

430
00:44:09,628 --> 00:44:11,224
边界掠夺者
The Fringers!

431
00:44:27,712 --> 00:44:29,505
我不是娜塔莉
I'm not Natalie.

432
00:44:33,822 --> 00:44:36,053
娜塔莉 不
Natalie, no!

433
00:44:37,797 --> 00:44:38,991
不
No!

434
00:44:39,016 --> 00:44:41,532
基因局的士兵
Bureau soldiers!

435
00:44:51,620 --> 00:44:53,478
左边 左翼包抄
Left!Flank left!

436
00:44:53,503 --> 00:44:55,536
打右边
Keep right! Keep right!Keep right!

437
00:44:55,851 --> 00:44:59,382
我们带你到基因局 你安全了
We're taking you to the Bureau.You're safe.

438
00:45:00,102 --> 00:45:02,348
不用再担惊受怕了
You don't have to be afraid anymore.

439
00:45:08,863 --> 00:45:11,543
- 今天你又救了多少孩子  - 不够多
- How many more did you save today? - Not enough.

440
00:45:11,568 --> 00:45:13,727
永远都不够多
We never get enough.

441
00:45:13,752 --> 00:45:17,430
芝加哥必须发挥作用 大卫 这是我们唯一的希望
Chicago has got to work, David.It's the only hope for us.

442
00:45:17,455 --> 00:45:22,015
在这片文明的废墟上 一小群基因未被改造的人
From the ashes of civilization, a small group of genetically unmodified individuals

443
00:45:22,040 --> 00:45:28,191
建立了你们今天所在的这个基因福利局 在这儿 芝加哥的奥黑尔机场
established the Bureau of Genetic Welfare,here at Chicago's O'Hare airport.

444
00:45:28,671 --> 00:45:30,185
你安全了
You're safe.

445
00:45:30,210 --> 00:45:32,860
其目的就是净化人类的基因组
a grand experiment,to purify the human genome.

446
00:45:32,890 --> 00:45:34,772
你现在安全了
You're safe now.

447
00:45:40,215 --> 00:45:43,759
你们的使命 从今天开始
Your destiny begins today.

448
00:45:51,515 --> 00:45:53,364
翠丝
Tris.

449
00:45:53,638 --> 00:45:56,358
在危急关头 你母亲做了一件
In a moment of need,your mother did something

450
00:45:56,383 --> 00:45:58,915
从没有人做过的事
that no one had done before.

451
00:45:58,940 --> 00:46:01,599
她自愿离开安全的基因局
She volunteered to leave the safety of the Bureau

452
00:46:01,624 --> 00:46:04,592
让自己加入到实验中
to enter the experiment herself.

453
00:46:05,277 --> 00:46:09,247
她做这些是因为她知道应该拯救缺陷者
She did this because she knew the "damaged" were worth saving.

454
00:46:09,272 --> 00:46:13,878
她非常相信实验 所以她自愿加入到实验中
She believed in the experiment so much she was willing to be a part of it.

455
00:46:14,232 --> 00:46:19,344
如果我让委员会看到你这个奇迹可以被复制
If I can show the Council your miracle can be replicated,

456
00:46:19,775 --> 00:46:22,810
那么她一生的工作就圆满了
then her life's work is complete.

457
00:46:23,176 --> 00:46:25,207
委员会将不得不公平地对待每个生命
The Council will be force to look at any human being,

458
00:46:25,232 --> 00:46:29,636
不管他们来自哪儿
No matter where they were born,is worthy of life.

459
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:35,840
帮帮我 你救了一座城市
Help me.You saved a city.

460
00:46:37,067 --> 00:46:39,468
再帮我救救这个世界吧
Help me save the world.

461
00:46:47,459 --> 00:46:49,430
太不可思议了
It was amazing.

462
00:46:49,455 --> 00:46:53,291
好像我变成了她 并通过她的眼睛看到了一切
It was like I was her and seeing it all through her eyes.

463
00:46:55,235 --> 00:46:58,680
我还是不能相信我妈妈来自这儿
I still can't believe my mom is from this place.

464
00:46:59,201 --> 00:47:01,681
我理解你妈妈为什么要离开了
Well, I can see why she left.

465
00:47:04,699 --> 00:47:08,960
你相信他吗  大卫
Do you trust him?David.

466
00:47:10,379 --> 00:47:12,331
我相信妈妈
I trust her.

467
00:47:13,262 --> 00:47:14,798
没错
Yeah.

Here you are.You ready?

472
00:48:03,558 --> 00:48:05,882
替我问候大卫
Say hi to David for me.

473
00:48:14,434 --> 00:48:16,677
托比亚斯·伊顿
Tobias Eaton.

474
00:48:17,217 --> 00:48:19,527
你分给我负责了
You've been assigned to me.

475
00:48:19,552 --> 00:48:22,867
我是妮塔 我们走
I am Nita.Let's go.

476
00:48:26,451 --> 00:48:28,859
为什么不是所有人都能上来
Why isn't everyone allowed upstairs?

477
00:48:28,884 --> 00:48:31,588
这是委员会众多规定中的一项
That would be one of the Council's many rules.

478
00:48:31,613 --> 00:48:33,303
我也没办法
Certainly not mine.

479
00:48:33,328 --> 00:48:35,006
这是隔离 我不喜欢
The Separation, I don't like it.

480
00:48:35,031 --> 00:48:38,030
我同意 这些到最后都是多余的
I agree, and in time,that won't be necessary.

481
00:48:38,055 --> 00:48:42,595
翠丝 我不知道是谁告诉你与众不同是件坏事的
But Tris, I don't know who told you that being different is a bad thing.

482
00:48:42,620 --> 00:48:45,415
因为我知道不是你母亲
Because I know it wasn't your mother.

483
00:48:53,724 --> 00:48:58,377
我知道能复制你的基因图谱 只是时间问题而已
Now I know I can replicate this.All I need is time.

484
00:48:58,402 --> 00:49:01,240
听着 雷吉娜 我们得谈谈 你看上去像个好人
Look, Regina, let's talk.You seem like a nice lady, but...

485
00:49:01,265 --> 00:49:03,572
但我真的不适合坐办公室
I'm really not a desk job kind of guy.

486
00:49:03,597 --> 00:49:04,879
我有幽闭恐惧症
I get claustrophobic.

487
00:49:04,904 --> 00:49:06,571
我得待在开放的地方
I need to be where the action is.

488
00:49:06,596 --> 00:49:08,371
监视工作就是要密切关注
The job of Surveillance is to keep tabs

489
00:49:08,396 --> 00:49:11,061
芝加哥日益动荡的局势
on the developing situation in Chicago.

490
00:49:11,086 --> 00:49:13,641
这工作绝对放得开
This is where the action is.

491
00:49:13,666 --> 00:49:17,671
海斯 这是你的监控室 普勒尔 你在隔壁
Hayes, this will be your pod.Prior, you're next door.

492
00:49:20,260 --> 00:49:23,618
抵抗运动日益激烈 伊芙琳势必会有所行动
Resistance is growing.Evelyn is beginning to respond.

493
00:49:23,643 --> 00:49:26,414
密切监视 然后提交报告
Watch what's happening,file a report.

494
00:49:26,439 --> 00:49:29,771
等等 天哪 我刚从芝加哥逃出来
Wait. What... Hold on.I just escaped from Chicago.

495
00:49:29,796 --> 00:49:31,270
现在你却要我后半辈子
Now you're saying, I got to sit here and watch it

496
00:49:31,295 --> 00:49:34,539
都待在这儿监视它 和他一起
for the rest of my life?With Caleb?

497
00:49:34,564 --> 00:49:37,613
也许你更愿意被驱逐到边界地带
Perhaps you prefer to be banished to the Fringe?

498
00:49:39,965 --> 00:49:43,748
这儿的监控技术太不可思议了
Ah.This Surveillance technology is incredible.

499
00:49:43,773 --> 00:49:47,212
- 造它的人肯定是天才  - 谢谢你
- Whoever created it, is a genius. - Well, thank you.

500
00:49:47,237 --> 00:49:48,793
能热爱你的工作
It was a labor of love.

501
00:49:48,818 --> 00:49:50,418
马屁精
Ass kisser.

502
00:49:51,035 --> 00:49:52,900
保持热情 普勒尔
Keep it up, Prior.

503
00:49:58,576 --> 00:50:01,222
还有你 开始工作
And you, get to it.

504
00:50:55,008 --> 00:50:56,956
火力够充足的
It's an awful lot of firepower.

505
00:50:56,983 --> 00:50:59,771
边界地带危机四伏
The Fringe is full of dangerous people.

506
00:51:00,065 --> 00:51:01,782
穿上这个
Put this on.

507
00:51:03,765 --> 00:51:05,750
- 这是什么  - 私人无人机
- What are these? - Personal drones.

508
00:51:05,775 --> 00:51:09,560
它能扩大视野 为你构建周围环境的3D模型
Expands your field of vision and provides 3D modeling and environments.

509
00:51:09,585 --> 00:51:11,268
就像过去在无畏派一样
Just like old times in Dauntless, huh?

510
00:51:11,293 --> 00:51:13,863
除了没有过时的东西以外
Except there is nothing old about any of this.

511
00:51:24,218 --> 00:51:25,883
给你
Here.

512
00:51:26,713 --> 00:51:27,937
谢谢
Thanks.

不太多
Not much.

519
00:52:01,113 --> 00:52:04,068
也就是用无人机找找目标
Use the drones to find the targets.

00:54:23,039 --> 00:54:27,036
我们越快做好准备 就能越早去普罗维登斯
The sooner we get finished,the sooner we leave for Providence.

541
00:54:39,432 --> 00:54:42,579
忠诚者 你们这么称呼自己吗
The Allegiant.That's what you're calling yourselves.

542
00:54:42,604 --> 00:54:45,559
友好派这个称呼已经不再合适了
Amity just doesn't seem appropriate anymore.

543
00:54:45,584 --> 00:54:49,462
那么你们到底忠诚于什么呢 派别体系吗
So, what exactly are you allegiant to?The faction system?

544
00:54:49,487 --> 00:54:52,466
派系在很长时间里维持了芝加哥的和平
The factions kept Chicago peaceful for a long time.

545
00:54:52,491 --> 00:54:55,668
我并不了解这个 因为我被迫离开了自己的派系
Well, I wouldn't know about that because I was forced out of my faction.

546
00:54:55,693 --> 00:54:58,412
我放弃了我的生活 我的孩子 所有的一切
I gave up my life,my child, everything.

547
00:54:58,437 --> 00:55:01,595
我理解你的愤怒 伊芙琳 真的
I understand your anger,Evelyn, I do.

548
00:55:01,968 --> 00:55:05,693
- 但是未来的路  - 未来的路已经铺好了
- But the way forward... - The way forward has already began.

549
00:55:08,705 --> 00:55:11,259
我说过我会一个人来
I know I said I'd be alone,but...

550
00:55:11,284 --> 00:55:13,884
但我不是诚实派 也不是友好派
I'm not Candor and I'm not Amity.

551
00:55:13,909 --> 00:55:17,636
所以我撒了谎 如果有必要的话我还会战斗
So I will lie and I will fight if I have to.

552
00:55:17,661 --> 00:55:21,871
看见这些伤疤了吗 我不是出生在友好派
You see these scars?I wasn't born Amity.

553
00:55:22,697 --> 00:55:27,055
我能向你保证 我并不害怕为信念而战
And I can assure you I'm not afraid to fight for what I believe in.

554
00:55:28,455 --> 00:55:30,973
看来我们是同一类人
It seems like we're 2 peas in a pot.

555
00:55:30,998 --> 00:55:33,883
但并不一定非要用这种方式
But it doesn't have to be this way.

556
00:55:33,908 --> 00:55:36,626
我们可以好好商量
We can come to some sort of agreement.

557
00:55:39,127 --> 00:55:41,036
- 退后  - 蹲下
- Get back! - Get down!

558
00:55:41,243 --> 00:55:42,553
- 离开这儿  - 我们走
- Get out of here! - Let's go.

559
00:55:42,578 --> 00:55:44,206
快走
Go!

560
00:55:54,850 --> 00:55:56,102
听着 凯莱布
Alright, Caleb.

561
00:55:56,127 --> 00:55:58,876
万一情况有变通知我好吗
Keep me posted if anything changes, alright?

562
00:56:06,939 --> 00:56:08,098


563
00:56:08,123 --> 00:56:10,956
凯莱布说无畏派的一些人站到了约翰娜这边
Caleb said that some of the Dauntless are lining with Johanna.

564
00:56:10,981 --> 00:56:13,892
但剩下的诚实派还和伊芙琳一个阵营
But the rest of Candor are still solid with Evelyn.

565
00:56:14,205 --> 00:56:16,573
局势就快失去控制了
Things are  finally out of control.

566
00:56:17,024 --> 00:56:19,547
大卫说过他能做什么吗
Did David say anything about what he can do?

567
00:56:19,572 --> 00:56:22,832
我们跟委员会谈完 基因局就能介入了
Yeah, once we talk to the Council,then the Bureau can step in.

568
00:56:24,564 --> 00:56:28,286
所以这全靠神秘的委员会了 对吧
So, it all hinges on the mysterious Council, does it?

569
00:56:28,311 --> 00:56:31,970
- 他们不同意怎么办  - 大卫有信心说服他们
- What if they say no? - David is confident that they won't.

570
00:56:32,424 --> 00:56:34,677
大卫 好吧
David, right.

571
00:56:36,912 --> 00:56:40,409
知道吗 我搞清楚自己为什么上不去了
You know, I found out why I can't go upstairs.

572
00:56:41,876 --> 00:56:45,167
我是缺陷者 你是纯净者
I'm "damaged",and you're "pure".

573
00:56:46,299 --> 00:56:48,297
我知道
I know.

574
00:56:49,635 --> 00:56:51,939
你知道 你打算什么时候告诉我
You know.When were you going to tell me?

575
00:56:52,939 --> 00:56:54,692
我不知道
I don't know.I...

576
00:56:54,717 --> 00:56:57,692
- 但我觉得这并不重要  - 为什么不重要
- I guess I didn't think that it matter. - Why doesn't it matter?

577
00:56:57,717 --> 00:57:02,313
因为不管你是纯净者还是缺陷者 都没有任何区别
Because it doesn't make a difference if you're "pure" or  you're "damaged".

578
00:57:04,050 --> 00:57:06,530
对我来说你就是你
You're still the same person to me.

579
00:57:11,945 --> 00:57:15,677
听着 我知道无论如何它都不完美
Look. I know that it's not perfect,by any means, but...

580
00:57:15,702 --> 00:57:18,320
但基因局从边界地带救出了我妈妈 没有他们我也不会来这儿
The Bureau saved my mother from the Fringe.I wouldn't be here without her.

581
00:57:18,345 --> 00:57:21,237
我们真了解他们在那儿做过什么吗
What do you actually know about what they do in the Fringe?

582
00:57:22,026 --> 00:57:23,789
你只是听他们说的
You know what they tell you.

583
00:57:23,814 --> 00:57:25,499
- 是的 但是  - 打扰一下
- Yeah, but... - I'm sorry.

584
00:57:25,524 --> 00:57:27,493
他要你上楼去
He needs you upstairs.

585
00:57:30,055 --> 00:57:32,196
他要你上楼去
He needs you upstairs.

586
00:57:52,147 --> 00:57:55,831
那些人很友好 虽然奇怪 但很友好
Those people are nice,weird, but nice.

587
00:57:55,856 --> 00:57:58,251
是啊 他们确实很奇怪
Yeah. They're definitely weird,that's for sure.

588
00:57:58,276 --> 00:58:00,425
你已经习惯了
You better get used to it.

589
00:58:00,450 --> 00:58:02,368
- 是吗 - 没错
- Really? - Yeah.

590
00:58:02,590 --> 00:58:05,058
下次去边界地带叫上我
Next time you go to the Fringe, I want in.

591
00:58:05,422 --> 00:58:06,718
你还没准备好
You're not ready.

592
00:58:06,743 --> 00:58:08,442
我准备好了
I'm going.

593
00:58:13,645 --> 00:58:15,243
翠丝
Tris.

594
00:58:15,268 --> 00:58:18,069
我注意到 分离对于
I'm more than aware that the separation

595
00:58:18,094 --> 00:58:20,636
你和老四来说的确很困难
has been difficult for you and Four, but...

596
00:58:20,661 --> 00:58:23,089
但我已经观察你们很久了
I've watched you both enough to know that

597
00:58:23,114 --> 00:58:26,265
我想你们该解决一下彼此之间的矛盾
I think the two of you are going to work it out.

598
00:58:27,804 --> 00:58:29,463
我们很好
We're fine.

599
00:58:31,988 --> 00:58:33,875
一直都很好
Everything's fine.

600
00:58:39,353 --> 00:58:42,093
好吧 我们开始工作吧
Good.Let's get to work.

601
00:58:51,598 --> 00:58:53,522
我们走 大家集合
Here we go!Fall in people!

602
00:58:53,547 --> 00:58:55,900
天气晴朗 执行搜捕行动
The weather's clear,we're green for a run!

603
00:58:55,925 --> 00:58:57,675
- 你们行动  我们走  - 快点儿
- You, let's go, let's go! - Come on, come on.

604
00:58:57,700 --> 00:59:00,108
- 我们走 - 准备走
- Move! Let's go! - Get ready to go!

605
00:59:03,897 --> 00:59:05,748
我们走
Let's go!

606
00:59:14,074 --> 00:59:16,667
好了 情况是这样的 听好了
Alright, here's the deal.Listen up!

607
00:59:16,692 --> 00:59:18,232
这是一个人道主义任务
This may be a Humanitarian mission,

608
00:59:18,257 --> 00:59:20,390
但是林代尔据点非常危险
but the dwindle settlement is very dangerous.

609
00:59:20,415 --> 00:59:23,101
- 大家都听清楚了吗  - 清楚
- Everybody clear? - Yes!

610
00:59:23,254 --> 00:59:26,105
- 外面的人平均能活多久  - 25到30年
- So, what's the life span out here? - 25 to 30 years.

611
00:59:26,130 --> 00:59:29,883
如果小时候就被救了 在基因局能活到50到60岁
But if we get people early, they can live up to 50 or 60 in the Bureau.

612
00:59:29,908 --> 00:59:34,158
无畏派 如果是我就不会让你们来这儿
Dauntless, if it's up to me,you would not be out here.

613
00:59:34,183 --> 00:59:37,241
我知道你们觉得芝加哥很危险 但这里更可怕
I know you think it was tough in Chicago, but this is the Fringe.

614
00:59:37,266 --> 00:59:39,159
- 明白吗  - 明白
- Understood? - Yes.

615
00:59:39,184 --> 00:59:41,180
我们的任务是尽可能救更多的孩子
The mission is to save as many kids as possible.

616
00:59:41,205 --> 00:59:43,109
避免他们在恶劣的环境中长大
They grow up in hellish conditions.

617
00:59:43,134 --> 00:59:47,225
虽然你们手上有武器 但不要轻易使用
But, you have your weapons handy,you stick to protocol.

618
00:59:47,250 --> 00:59:49,318
我不想有任何伤亡
I don't want to lose any one.

619
01:00:00,006 --> 01:00:02,922
带上你们的枪
Get out your weapons.

620
01:00:03,577 --> 01:00:05,472
快跑
Come on, let's go!

621
01:00:24,956 --> 01:00:27,773
快 我们要行动了
Go! Go! Go.We got to move!

622
01:00:35,165 --> 01:00:36,825
启动无人机
Drones!

623
01:00:37,204 --> 01:00:38,628
上
Go!

624
01:00:40,709 --> 01:00:41,804
救命
Help!

625
01:00:41,829 --> 01:00:44,688
停下来 好了 没事了
Stop. Stop, stop.Hey, hey, hey. It's okay.

626
01:00:44,713 --> 01:00:46,328
我想见爸爸 求你了
I want my dad.Please!

627
01:00:46,353 --> 01:00:49,306
不 我想要爸爸
No! No!Dad!

628
01:00:50,566 --> 01:00:53,184
没事了 跟着我
Everything will be fine.Let's go. Let's go.

629
01:01:43,214 --> 01:01:44,629
跟我来
Come on!

630
01:01:46,537 --> 01:01:48,012
快跑
Run!

631
01:01:59,282 --> 01:02:01,174
<font color="#80ffff">目标搜索中</font>

632
01:02:04,624 --> 01:02:06,995
这边跑
This way.This way.

<font color="#80ffff">Target identified.</font>

634
01:02:14,242 --> 01:02:15,477
快
Go!

635
01:02:19,028 --> 01:02:21,103
- 站住  - 离我们远点儿
- Stop! - Just stay away from us!

636
01:02:21,128 --> 01:02:23,848
- 冷静点儿 我们是来帮你们的  - 我们不需要你们帮助
- Calm down. We're here to help. - We don't need your help.

637
01:02:23,873 --> 01:02:26,013
- 我们想跟你谈谈  - 我不想失去家人
- I just want to talk to you. - I'm not going to lose my family!

638
01:02:26,038 --> 01:02:27,808
站住 不要
Hey!Whoa, whoa, whoa. Stop!

639
01:02:27,833 --> 01:02:30,310
- 放开他 走开 - 放开他
-  Let go! Get away! - Get off him!

640
01:02:30,335 --> 01:02:32,875
放开我的孩子 别碰他
Get off him!Don't touch my boy!

641
01:02:44,771 --> 01:02:46,279
你干了什么
What did you do?

642
01:02:46,288 --> 01:02:47,899
好了 没事了
Come on.It's okay. It's alright.

643
01:02:47,924 --> 01:02:49,101
- 我想见我爸爸  - 我知道
- I want to see my dad. - I know, I know.

644
01:02:49,126 --> 01:02:51,084
老四 我们走 快撤离
Four, let's go!We got to move!

645
01:02:51,109 --> 01:02:52,286
没事了
It's alright.It's okay.

646
01:02:52,311 --> 01:02:54,249
快走 我们要离开了 快撤离
Go!We got to go, we got to go.

647
01:02:54,274 --> 01:02:55,851
我们走 快点儿 快
It's okay.Come on. Come on.

648
01:02:55,876 --> 01:02:57,882、
- 罗米特  - 让开
- Romit! - Don't.

649
01:02:57,907 --> 01:03:00,078
究竟发生了什么事
What the hell is going on here?

650
01:03:01,571 --> 01:03:03,946
做好你自己的事 无畏派
Just do you job, Dauntless.

651
01:03:03,971 --> 01:03:08,012
我们走 快点儿
Let's go!Move!

652
01:03:09,841 --> 01:03:11,592
我们走
Let's go!

653
01:03:18,770 --> 01:03:22,321
一个大人 两个孩子 送他们上飞机 快
One man, two children.Get them on the plane, go!

654
01:03:26,231 --> 01:03:27,907
回这儿来
Get back here!

655
01:03:30,805 --> 01:03:31,884
不
No!

656
01:03:31,909 --> 01:03:34,226
你们都闭嘴
I said, shut up.All of you.

657
01:03:34,251 --> 01:03:36,153
- 嘿  - 你 站住
- Hey. - You, stop!

658
01:03:36,925 --> 01:03:39,805
这叫香皂 你应该用用
It's called a soap,you should try it.

659
01:03:39,830 --> 01:03:41,801
怎么了僵尸人 迷路了吗
What's up, Stiff?You lost?

660
01:03:41,826 --> 01:03:43,071
我想找老四
I wanted to see Four.

661
01:03:43,096 --> 01:03:45,644
大卫和我准备去普罗维登斯
David and I are leaving for Providence.

662
01:03:45,780 --> 01:03:47,958
和关系亲密的头儿一起 是吗
On a first name bases with the director, huh?

663
01:03:47,983 --> 01:03:50,838
- 进展得挺快啊  - 皮特 别烦她了
- You work fast. - Peter, can you leave her alone.

664
01:03:52,085 --> 01:03:54,421
我不需要你帮我
I don't need you to defend me.

665
01:03:54,552 --> 01:03:56,295
立正
Attention!

666
01:03:59,703 --> 01:04:02,090
做好去普罗维登斯的准备 一小时之后起飞
Get us ready for Providence.I want my ship within an hour.

667
01:04:02,120 --> 01:04:03,514
- 是 长官  - 跟我来
- Yes, sir. - Follow me.

668
01:04:03,539 --> 01:04:04,604
大卫
David, hey.

669
01:04:04,629 --> 01:04:06,447
我能不能跟你聊聊我的工作
I was wondering if I can talk to you about my job.

670
01:04:06,472 --> 01:04:08,775
你知道 我真的不适合坐办公室
You know, I'm not really a typist and...

671
01:04:08,800 --> 01:04:10,510
如果今天你忙 我能理解
Or if you are busy today, I get it.

672
01:04:10,535 --> 01:04:12,728
没事儿 我们明天再聊也行
Totally fine, we'll talk tomorrow.

673
01:04:12,753 --> 01:04:14,661
好主意
Good idea.

674
01:04:16,363 --> 01:04:17,932
谢谢你
Thank you.

675
01:04:24,107 --> 01:04:26,058
我要跟你谈谈
I need to talk to you.

676
01:04:26,927 --> 01:04:28,698
这在干什么 妮塔
What is this, Nita?

677
01:04:29,338 --> 01:04:30,593
打疫苗
Vaccinations.

678
01:04:30,618 --> 01:04:33,965
打疫苗什么意思 我们几个都没打过疫苗
What do you mean, vaccinations?We weren't given vaccinations.

679
01:04:35,106 --> 01:04:36,629
老四
Four.

680
01:04:38,371 --> 01:04:40,070
看看这个
Look at this.

681
01:04:41,810 --> 01:04:43,979
你叫什么
Hey.What's your name?

682
01:04:44,004 --> 01:04:45,700
我叫什么
My name?

683
01:04:49,369 --> 01:04:50,902
嗨
Hey.

684
01:04:51,632 --> 01:04:55,340
- 你爸爸的事我很难过  - 我爸爸
- I'm sorry about your dad. - My dad?

685
01:05:00,482 --> 01:05:02,969
- 好了 基因局总部见  - 好的
- Alright, I'll see you back at base. - Yep.

686
01:05:04,875 --> 01:05:06,577
这不是人道主义任务
This is not a humanitarian mission.

687
01:05:06,602 --> 01:05:09,337
我们不是在救孩子 而是在绑架
We're not saving kids,we're stealing them.

688
01:05:09,894 --> 01:05:12,087
这就是我们的工作 现在你知道了
This is what we do.Now you know.

689
01:05:12,112 --> 01:05:13,842
大卫从这儿把他们带走
David takes them out from here,

690
01:05:13,867 --> 01:05:17,950
用记忆血清抹掉他们的记忆 让他们在基因局里长大
wipes their memories with the gas,and raises them in the Bureau.

691
01:05:18,283 --> 01:05:20,783
如果抹掉他们的记忆 也就抹掉了他们的身份
If you take away what they know,then you take away who they are.

692
01:05:20,808 --> 01:05:24,316
没错 我想这就是目的
Yeah.I think that's the point.

693
01:05:49,821 --> 01:05:51,722
他们都没有武器
They were all unarmed.

694
01:05:54,240 --> 01:05:56,663
我不会因此投降的
I won't surrender to this.

695
01:05:57,614 --> 01:06:00,027
看看还有没有活着的
Round up anyone who's left.

696
01:06:00,052 --> 01:06:02,719
我们要跟伊芙琳开战
We take the fight to Evelyn.

697
01:06:02,744 --> 01:06:04,627
好 我去装车
Yeah.I'm loading up.

698
01:06:04,652 --> 01:06:06,316
我们马上走
Let's go.

699
01:06:09,896 --> 01:06:11,409
快走
Move it.

700
01:06:14,874 --> 01:06:17,889
今天我们要打倒伊芙琳
Today we take Evelyn down!

701
01:06:17,914 --> 01:06:20,161
不惜一切代价
Whatever it takes!

702
01:06:27,931 --> 01:06:29,328
这是正在发生的事
This is all real time.

703
01:06:29,353 --> 01:06:31,748
他们这儿的监控技术简直了得
I mean, this Surveillance Technology they have in place is extraordinary.

704
01:06:31,773 --> 01:06:34,144
凯莱布 能先别想自己的事儿吗
Caleb, can you get out of your head for a second?

705
01:06:34,169 --> 01:06:36,031
那儿是我们的家
This is our home.

706
01:06:36,056 --> 01:06:38,180
那儿就要开战了
There's going to be a war.

707
01:06:40,181 --> 01:06:41,829
你去哪儿
Where are you going?

708
01:06:42,635 --> 01:06:44,729
得为芝加哥做点儿什么
I'm going to do something about it.

709
01:06:56,567 --> 01:06:59,574
老四 你这是要去干什么
Four, what are you trying to do?

710
01:06:59,599 --> 01:07:02,008
我去找翠丝 我们得离开
Getting Tris.We're leaving.

711
01:07:02,033 --> 01:07:04,090
你不能上去
You can't go up there.

712
01:07:05,795 --> 01:07:07,435
- 你知道自己在干什么吗  - 老四
- What do you think you are doing? - Four!

713
01:07:07,460 --> 01:07:09,148
- 你不能来这儿  - 老四
- You cannot be in here. - Four.

714
01:07:09,173 --> 01:07:10,955
- 这么做没用的  - <font color="#ff80c0">纯净</font>
- It's not going to work. - <font color="#ff80c0">Pure.</font>

715
01:07:10,980 --> 01:07:14,203
中央电梯被侵入了
Central elevator has been compromised.

716
01:07:37,374 --> 01:07:38,839
我们得离开
We're leaving.

717
01:07:38,864 --> 01:07:40,147
- 什么  - 快点儿
- What? - Right now.

718
01:07:40,175 --> 01:07:41,557
什么 我不能走
What?I can't.

719
01:07:41,587 --> 01:07:44,386
听着 你还不了解情况 这些人在骗你
You don't understand yet, but these people have been lying to you.

720
01:07:44,411 --> 01:07:45,845
骗我 你在说什么呢
Lying?What are you talking about?

721
01:07:45,870 --> 01:07:48,516
听着 不管他们说什么 其实他们
Look, whatever they told you.They've been...

722
01:07:48,541 --> 01:07:50,410
放下武器
Put the guns down.

723
01:07:50,435 --> 01:07:53,083
这个大卫他一直都在抢别人的孩子
He's been stealing children from their families.

724
01:07:53,108 --> 01:07:54,773
我们给他们更好的生活
We're giving them a better life.

725
01:07:54,798 --> 01:07:58,705
- 通过杀他们父母  - 那只是个意外 长官
- By killing their parents? - It was an unfortunate accident. Sir.

726
01:08:00,378 --> 01:08:03,415
一个可怕的意外不代表这么做是错的
One terrible accident doesn't mean that it was the wrong thing to do.

727
01:08:03,440 --> 01:08:05,416
翠丝 这个地方跟我们想的不一样
Tris, This is not the place that we thought it was suppose to be.

728
01:08:05,441 --> 01:08:07,261
如果你有能力去救一个人
If you have enough to save one person,

729
01:08:07,286 --> 01:08:11,024
你是选择救健康的孩子还是救生病的老人
and your choice was between a healthy child or a sick old man,

730
01:08:11,049 --> 01:08:12,861
- 你选谁  - 我不会去选择
- who would you choose? - I wouldn't choose!

731
01:08:12,886 --> 01:08:15,247
好吧 那他俩就都死了
Good, now they're both dead.

732
01:08:15,843 --> 01:08:18,002
我们得走了
We have to go.

733
01:08:19,926 --> 01:08:22,799
翠丝 我们得回芝加哥去 我们不应该离开那儿
Tris. We're going back to Chicago, we shouldn't ever have left.

734
01:08:22,823 --> 01:08:25,017
- 不 我们得再等等  - 不 我们一直在等
- No, we have to wait. - Yeah, we've been waiting.

735
01:08:25,042 --> 01:08:27,172
好吗 大卫根本就不是你想的那种人
Okay, David is not the person that you think he is.

736
01:08:27,197 --> 01:08:28,972
老四 你完全不了解大卫
Four, you know nothing about David.

737
01:08:28,997 --> 01:08:30,744
你不了解我们都在这儿忙了些什么
You've no idea what we've been working up here.

738
01:08:30,769 --> 01:08:32,074
你们忙些什么
What have you been working on?

739
01:08:32,099 --> 01:08:33,988
你知道芝加哥现在发生什么了吗
Do you have any idea what is going on out there?

740
01:08:34,013 --> 01:08:35,490
知道 我当然知道
Yes, of course I do.

741
01:08:35,515 --> 01:08:37,856
这就是我们为什么要去见委员会的人
Why do you think we're going to meet with the Council?

742
01:08:37,881 --> 01:08:39,403
翠丝
Tris.

743
01:08:40,596 --> 01:08:42,405
我求你认真听我说
I want you to listen to me.

744
01:08:42,430 --> 01:08:44,071
翠丝
Tris.

745
01:08:47,476 --> 01:08:49,432
跟我回去
You're coming with me.

746
01:08:53,251 --> 01:08:55,112
我得走了
I have to go.

747
01:09:11,323 --> 01:09:13,492
你这么做是错的
You're making a mistake.

748
01:09:44,287 --> 01:09:45,966
准备好了
You ready?

749
01:09:47,740 --> 01:09:49,230
是的
Yeah.

750
01:09:50,470 --> 01:09:53,262
<font color="#ff80ff">启动自动驾驶</font>
<font color="#ff80ff">Autopilot engage.</font>

751
01:10:19,781 --> 01:10:22,390
想回芝加哥我带你去
You want to go back to Chicago,I'll take you.

752
01:10:22,683 --> 01:10:24,336
不了 谢谢
No, thanks.

753
01:10:24,602 --> 01:10:27,482
就这么走着穿越边界地带
You want to walk cross the Fringe,I don't think so.

754
01:10:28,277 --> 01:10:30,370
没有规定说你不能回家
There's no rule saying you can't go home, Four.

755
01:10:30,395 --> 01:10:31,750
跟我来
Come on.

756
01:10:33,342 --> 01:10:35,740
- 好吧  - 我和你一起去
- Yeah. - I'll go with you.

757
01:10:46,105 --> 01:10:47,796
准备就绪
All set.

758
01:10:48,534 --> 01:10:50,564
我们去芝加哥
Take us to Chicago.

759
01:10:55,855 --> 01:10:58,714
听着 我理解你的感受
Look, I understand how you're feeling.But...

760
01:10:58,739 --> 01:11:03,281
但是你现在要做的事 对全世界而言将产生巨大的影响
What you're about to do has ramifications for people all over the world.

761
01:11:03,907 --> 01:11:08,484
如果老四不理解 也不要往心里去
If Four doesn't see that,it's not your fault.

762
01:11:29,398 --> 01:11:32,483
大卫根本不想让你看到边界地带的事
David never wanted you to see what you saw, out on the Fringe.

763
01:11:32,508 --> 01:11:35,913
他一直严格控制 没有允许什么都不能做
He keeps tight control.Nothing happens without his approval.

764
01:11:35,946 --> 01:11:40,291
他的飞船是唯一可以穿越伪装墙的
And his ship, is the only one that can fly through the camo wall.

765
01:11:41,086 --> 01:11:43,115
为什么要跟我说这个
Why are you telling me this?

766
01:11:44,159 --> 01:11:46,719
我们不会送你回芝加哥的
We are not taking you to Chicago.

767
01:12:48,419 --> 01:12:50,056
抓紧了
Hold on!

768
01:13:17,400 --> 01:13:20,061
欢迎来到普罗维登斯
Welcome to Providence.

769
01:13:31,534 --> 01:13:34,137
明白他们为什么不愿意分享了
I can see why they don't want to share it.

770
01:13:34,702 --> 01:13:38,028
有一天全世界都会像这儿一样美
Some day, the whole world is going to look this beautiful.

771
01:13:51,358 --> 01:13:53,229
诚如诸位所见 有多种基因标记
So, as you can see,there are multiple

772
01:13:53,254 --> 01:13:55,501
可以支撑这个结论
genetic markers supporting this conclusion.

773
01:13:55,526 --> 01:13:59,840
标准性格测试 行为评估 刺激反应
Standard personality test.Behavioral evaluations. Stimulus response.

774
01:13:59,865 --> 01:14:02,046
她轻而易举地通过了所有的测试
She's passed them all with flying colors.

775
01:14:02,071 --> 01:14:04,815
如果这是真的 听起来确实不错
It all sounds great assuming it's the truth.

776
01:14:04,840 --> 01:14:05,856
菲利普
Phillip.

777
01:14:05,881 --> 01:14:09,661
大卫以前骗过我们 不是吗 大卫
David has lied to us before,haven't you, David?

778
01:14:09,845 --> 01:14:11,212
让这个女孩说说
I like to hear from the girl.

779
01:14:11,237 --> 01:14:13,826
要知道 她可不会为了我而撒谎
Well, I don't know why she can't tell you anything I'm not.

780
01:14:13,851 --> 01:14:16,351
帮个忙 大卫
Indulge us, David.

781
01:14:17,279 --> 01:14:20,053
发现自己是纯净者
This must all come as quite a shock to you, Miss Prior,

782
01:14:20,058 --> 01:14:22,603
对你来说一定很吃惊吧 普勒尔小姐
finding out that you are pure

783
01:14:22,628 --> 01:14:23,969
嗯
Um.

784
01:14:24,215 --> 01:14:27,395
纯净者 我甚至都不知道是什么
Pure. I'm not even sure what's that suppose to mean.

785
01:14:28,351 --> 01:14:29,902
没错 我很吃惊
But yes, it is shocking to me.

786
01:14:29,927 --> 01:14:33,350
我对过去了解得越多就越感觉到
Shocking that the more I learn about the past, the more I feel like...

787
01:14:33,375 --> 01:14:35,648
你们好像一直在犯同一个错误
you're all making the same mistakes over and over again.

788
01:14:35,673 --> 01:14:40,015
- 翠丝 别这么说话  - 让她说 大卫
- Tris, this is not the way. - Let her speak, David.

789
01:14:41,291 --> 01:14:43,104
什么错误 翠丝
What mistakes, Tris?

790
01:14:43,129 --> 01:14:46,304
人类不能用这种方法进行分类
The human beings cannot be categorized in this way.

791
01:14:46,329 --> 01:14:48,070
这是没用的
It doesn't work.

792
01:14:48,095 --> 01:14:54,169
也许是时候接受所有人了 而不是把他们分在不同的群体里
Maybe it's time to start embracing everyone instead of dividing them into groups.

793
01:14:54,381 --> 01:14:57,200
无论他们是纯净者还是缺陷者
Regardless whether they are 'pure' or they are 'damaged'.

794
01:14:57,225 --> 01:15:00,392
- 这不是我们现在要讨论的问题  - 这应该是
- That isn't what we're here to discuss. - Well, it should be.

795
01:15:01,110 --> 01:15:04,281
听着 我知道一切对你们来说是一项实验
Look, I know that all of this is just an experiment to you,

796
01:15:04,306 --> 01:15:07,038
但对芝加哥的人民来说却是真实的
but these people in Chicago are real.

797
01:15:07,063 --> 01:15:09,854
你们创建的派系导致他们现在仍生活在战乱里
And they're in a war right now because of divisions that you created,

798
01:15:09,879 --> 01:15:11,662
而你们却无动于衷
and you are doing nothing to help them.

799
01:15:11,687 --> 01:15:15,767
你要知道大卫才是掌握芝加哥管理权的人
David has control over the administration of Chicago.

800
01:15:17,500 --> 01:15:19,847
他来这儿只是为了增加他的经费
He's only here to extend his funding.

801
01:15:19,872 --> 01:15:21,381
我们乐于做某些事
Which, we would be happy to do,

802
01:15:21,406 --> 01:15:24,099
但如果真像她说得那么差劲 大卫
but if things are as bad as she says, David.

803
01:15:24,124 --> 01:15:27,393
你难道不该先解决一下自家问题吗
Shouldn't you get your house in order first?

804
01:15:43,423 --> 01:15:45,769
你跟我说过你无能为力
You said that you couldn't do anything.

805
01:15:45,793 --> 01:15:49,452
我已经在行动了 我正在重建派别制度
I am doing something.I'm bring back the factions.

806
01:15:49,478 --> 01:15:51,819
什么 为什么
What?Why?

807
01:15:51,844 --> 01:15:54,589
我希望忠诚者能为我解决这个问题
I hope the Allegiant will take care of the problem for me.

808
01:15:54,614 --> 01:15:56,490
派系是有用的 翠丝
The factions work, Tris.

809
01:15:56,515 --> 01:16:00,221
它们围护了和平 成就了你
They keep the peace,they created you.

810
01:16:02,140 --> 01:16:04,642
我真不应该相信你
I never should have trusted you.

811
01:16:06,896 --> 01:16:11,683
你想不牺牲就革命 你想不斗争就迎来和平
You want change with no sacrifice,you want peace with no struggle.

812
01:16:11,876 --> 01:16:14,351
这个世界不是这样的
The world doesn't work like that.

813
01:16:32,102 --> 01:16:33,624
还好吗
You okay?

814
01:16:34,983 --> 01:16:36,776
我还好
I'll be fine.

815
01:16:36,818 --> 01:16:38,346
快到基因局了
I hope the Bureau isn't far.

816
01:16:38,371 --> 01:16:40,106
我要去芝加哥 告诉伊芙琳
I need to get to Chicago,and tell Evelyn

817
01:16:40,131 --> 01:16:42,870
她犯的错误比约翰娜更严重
she's got a lot bigger problem than Johanna.

818
01:16:44,401 --> 01:16:47,649
你需要这个才能穿越伪装墙
You'll need this,to get through the camo wall.

819
01:16:47,676 --> 01:16:50,281
我们需要你的帮助 托比亚斯
We need your help, Tobias.

820
01:16:50,306 --> 01:16:52,785
你不了解大卫的真面目
You don't know what he's capable of.

821
01:16:55,540 --> 01:16:57,393
翠丝怎么办
What about Tris?

822
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:01,522
只要待在基因局里 她就是安全的
As long as she stays in the Bureau, she's safe.

823
01:17:01,898 --> 01:17:04,126
她对大卫来说很重要
She's too valuable to him.

824
01:17:07,152 --> 01:17:09,092
那我就先走了
I'll need a head start.

825
01:17:10,011 --> 01:17:11,806
大卫问起来
When David asks,

826
01:17:11,831 --> 01:17:14,012
你就跟他说我背叛了你们
I want you to tell him that I left you behind.

827
01:17:14,036 --> 01:17:15,384
好吗
Okay?

828
01:17:15,732 --> 01:17:18,919
- 为什么  - 因为翠丝会知道你在说谎
- Why? - Because Tris will know you're lying.

831
01:18:34,267 --> 01:18:36,147
出了点儿事
There was an accident.

832
01:18:36,791 --> 01:18:39,439
遇到一股气流 虽然没有风暴厉害
There was turbulence, not more than any other storm, but...

833
01:18:39,464 --> 01:18:42,033
也许是闪电
The lightning, maybe.

834
01:18:42,505 --> 01:18:44,803
- 接着飞机就坠毁了  - 老四呢
- We just went down. - Where's Four?

835
01:18:44,828 --> 01:18:45,951
我不知道
I don't know.

836
01:18:45,976 --> 01:18:49,768
我失去意识了 等我醒过来 所有人都死了
I passed out, when I came to,everyone was dead.

837
01:18:49,793 --> 01:18:51,231
老四丢下了我
Four left me behind.

838
01:18:51,256 --> 01:18:53,817
好吧 找找那些据点 在边界地带搜索
Okay, we search the settlement,search the Fringe.

839
01:18:53,842 --> 01:18:55,237
看他在不在那儿
Make sure he's not there.

840
01:18:55,262 --> 01:18:58,628
别担心 会找到的 我保证
Don't worry.We'll find him, I promise.

841
01:19:03,273 --> 01:19:06,256
老四是绝不会在出事后丢下任何人的
Four would never leave anyone behind at the crash site.

842
01:19:06,281 --> 01:19:09,301
没错 他告诉我你一定会这么说的
Yeah.He told me you would say that.

843
01:19:09,694 --> 01:19:12,591
老四这会儿在回芝加哥的路上
Four is trying to make his way back to Chicago.

844
01:19:51,058 --> 01:19:54,216
- 皮特  - 你好 大卫
- Peter. - Hello, David.

845
01:19:54,317 --> 01:19:56,654
我以为你不知道我的名字
I didn't think that you knew my name.

846
01:19:56,678 --> 01:19:59,993
我了解所有芝加哥来的重要人物
I know all of the important people from Chicago.

847
01:20:00,687 --> 01:20:02,141
是吗
Really?

848
01:20:03,227 --> 01:20:05,526
如果我真那么重要
Well, if I'm so important,

849
01:20:05,550 --> 01:20:09,084
为什么你还让我干那么烂的活儿
then why did you give me such a terrible job?

850
01:20:09,691 --> 01:20:12,573
我们都得做出一些牺牲
We all have to make sacrifices.

851
01:20:16,311 --> 01:20:18,461
你也牺牲了
I don't see you making any.

852
01:20:21,217 --> 01:20:22,714
皮特
Peter.

853

我需要芝加哥那边有人帮我
I need help with something in Chicago.

854
01:20:33,268 --> 01:20:35,313
我能有什么好处
What's in it for me?

855
01:20:36,053 --> 01:20:39,155
如果完成得不错 工作随便你挑
Well, if you do well,you can have any job you want.

856
01:20:40,890 --> 01:20:42,647
除了我的
Except mine.

857
01:21:04,489 --> 01:21:06,529
知道皮特在哪儿吗
Do you know where Peter is ?

858
01:21:06,763 --> 01:21:08,804
不在监控室吗
Uh, he's not in his pod?

859
01:21:08,829 --> 01:21:10,269
不在
No.

860
01:21:10,408 --> 01:21:12,742
不在 那就不知道了
No, I don't know where he is.

861
01:21:19,559 --> 01:21:22,405
还有什么能帮你的吗
Is there something that I can help you with?

862
01:21:26,500 --> 01:21:28,613
帮我找找老四
Can you find Four?

863
01:21:30,315 --> 01:21:32,449
别告诉别人
You can't tell anyone.

864
01:21:32,474 --> 01:21:34,436
好的 没问题
Okay, of course.

865
01:21:37,373 --> 01:21:40,223
都听你的 碧翠丝
Anything you need, Beatrice.

866
01:21:59,442 --> 01:22:01,918
快点儿 老四你在哪儿
Come on, Four, where are you?

867
01:22:04,957 --> 01:22:09,407
伊芙琳 我们在围墙外发现了他
Evelyn.We found him outside the wall.

868
01:22:11,347 --> 01:22:13,322
把面罩摘了
Take it off.

869
01:22:17,743 --> 01:22:20,199
我儿子在哪儿
Where's my son?

870
01:22:21,598 --> 01:22:23,243
我不知道
I don't know.

871
01:22:25,371 --> 01:22:27,273
埃德加告诉了我围墙外的情况
Edgar told me what's out there.

872
01:22:27,298 --> 01:22:31,776
所以你最好说点儿什么 否则我们现在就审判你 说
So you better start talking,or we'll be holding your trial now!

873
01:22:31,801 --> 01:22:33,852
不 你不会的
No, you won't.

874
01:22:33,877 --> 01:22:36,033
因为我有你想要的东西
Because I have something that you need.

875
01:22:36,058 --> 01:22:39,705
是吗 什么东西
Really?And what's that?

876
01:22:40,357 --> 01:22:42,938
能赢得战争的东西
The way to win your war.

877
01:22:45,644 --> 01:22:47,274


878
01:22:47,299 --> 01:22:48,927
有消息吗
Any news?

879
01:22:49,772 --> 01:22:51,271
没有
No.

880
01:22:54,657 --> 01:22:55,833
我很遗憾
I'm sorry.

881
01:22:55,858 --> 01:22:57,066
翠丝
Tris!

882
01:22:57,090 --> 01:22:59,131
- 找到他了  - 是的 找到了
- Did you find him? - Yes, I found Four.

883
01:22:59,156 --> 01:23:01,750
还有些更让你感兴趣的东西
And there's something else you're going to want to see too.

884
01:23:03,510 --> 01:23:05,226
好了 来吧
Okay, go.

885
01:23:07,482 --> 01:23:10,622
在那儿 就是他 发现他了
Over there!That's him! We got him!

886
01:23:13,591 --> 01:23:15,159
老四
Four.

887
01:23:15,455 --> 01:23:18,712
别担心 他没事 你往下看
Don't worry, he's fine.Just... keep watching.

888
01:23:21,259 --> 01:23:23,288
这是什么地方
What is this place?

889
01:23:23,313 --> 01:23:25,174
你会喜欢它的
You're going to love it.

890
01:23:57,598 --> 01:23:58,970
这是什么
What is it?

891
01:23:58,995 --> 01:24:01,442
试一下 就知道了
Try it out.You'll see.

892
01:24:02,576 --> 01:24:05,562
别用在你喜欢的人身上
Just don't try it on anyone you like.

893
01:24:09,233 --> 01:24:12,922
我一直在想你什么时候才有勇气面对我
I was wondering when you'll have the courage to face me.

894
01:24:12,947 --> 01:24:15,593
我在这儿已经三个星期了
3 weeks you leave me here.

895
01:24:15,618 --> 01:24:17,645
我管理着一个派系
I run a faction!

896
01:24:17,670 --> 01:24:21,294
我保护我们的儿子不受珍宁的迫害
I protected our son from Jeanine's thugs.

897
01:24:21,646 --> 01:24:25,422
你保护他 你管这叫保护
Protected him.Is that what you call it?

898
01:24:25,447 --> 01:24:27,927
暴打你自己的孩子
Beating your own child.

899
01:24:28,984 --> 01:24:31,663
这才成就了今天的他
It made him who he is.

900
01:24:45,419 --> 01:24:47,849
注意控制一下剂量
Make sure he gets a good dose.

901
01:25:21,358 --> 01:25:24,220
托比亚斯 我这么做只想让你变得更好
Tobias, I was trying to make you to be better.

902
01:25:25,541 --> 01:25:28,726
托比亚斯 我这么做只想让你变得更好
Tobias, I was trying to make you to be better.

903
01:25:46,611 --> 01:25:49,502
我很抱歉
I'm-I'm sorry, but...

904
01:25:51,638 --> 01:25:53,867
可是你是谁
Who you are?

905
01:25:58,329 --> 01:26:01,944
想象一下如果把这个用在忠诚者身上
Just imagine if you release this on the Allegiant.

906
01:26:01,969 --> 01:26:06,693
甚至连约翰娜也不会记得 你曾经不是这里的领导者
Not even Johanna will remember a time that you weren't in charge.

907
01:26:06,940 --> 01:26:09,380
这个东西是谁给你的
Who exactly told you about this?

908
01:26:09,405 --> 01:26:11,828
在围墙外面有个特别挺你的朋友
You have a very powerful friend on the outside,

909
01:26:11,853 --> 01:26:14,809
只要你选择合作 而不是反抗
if you choose to engage instead of prepare.

910
01:26:14,834 --> 01:26:17,932
- 这位朋友叫什么名字  - 大卫
- Does this friend have a name? - David.

911
01:26:20,379 --> 01:26:21,428
大卫
David?

912
01:26:21,453 --> 01:26:26,558
你可以告诉这位的朋友不到最后一刻我是不会用这东西的
You can tell my friend I'm not going to use that thing unless it's a last resort.

913
01:26:27,482 --> 01:26:30,327
大卫为什么要支持伊芙琳
Why would David support Evelyn?

914
01:26:30,514 --> 01:26:33,019
完全没道理
It doesn't make any sense.

915
01:26:39,331 --> 01:26:41,697
你还好吗 我很担心你
Are you okay?I was worried about you.

916
01:26:41,722 --> 01:26:43,658
伊芙琳 你得跟忠诚者讲和
Evelyn, you need to make peace with the Allegiant.

917
01:26:43,683 --> 01:26:47,909
不 约翰娜已经做出了选择 我从没想过发动战争
No, Johanna made her choice.I never wanted this war.

918
01:26:47,934 --> 01:26:49,570
我会结束它的 我向你保证
But I will end it, I promise you.

919
01:26:49,595 --> 01:26:51,167
你都不知道你的敌人是谁
You have no idea what you are up against.

920
01:26:51,192 --> 01:26:53,680
- 约翰娜不是问题的关键  - 听着
- Johanna is not the issue. - Look.

921
01:26:53,705 --> 01:26:57,932
我知道你还在生我的气 这一点我能理解
I know you're angry at me and I understand that.

922
01:26:57,957 --> 01:27:01,836
我只是 我从来没有
I'm just...I never meant...

923
01:27:03,247 --> 01:27:04,535
现在对我来说也很艰难
This is so hard for me too.

924
01:27:04,560 --> 01:27:06,430
我心里也不想把你关在这儿
I don't want to have to keep you in here.

925
01:27:06,455 --> 01:27:08,393
那就让我出去
Then, let me out.

926
01:27:10,677 --> 01:27:13,653
我做不到 因为这是我的责任
I can't,I have responsibilities.

927
01:27:13,678 --> 01:27:17,775
总有一天你会理解我的 但现在我必须让你待在这儿
One day, you'll understand that,but right now I need you to stay here.

928
01:27:17,800 --> 01:27:20,617
无论发生什么 我都会结束这一切的
I'm going to finish this.One way or another.

929
01:27:20,642 --> 01:27:22,943
你打算怎么结束这一切
How are you going to finish this?

930
01:27:23,219 --> 01:27:26,070
别担心 你不会待太久了
Hey, don't worry.You won't have to be here for long.

931
01:27:26,486 --> 01:27:29,065
你在说什么
What-What are you talking about?

932
01:27:29,173 --> 01:27:30,666
伊芙琳还在拿主意
Well, Evelyn is deciding now,

933
01:27:30,692 --> 01:27:35,466
如果她使用记忆血清 所有人都会忘了自己是谁
If she use the memory serum,Chicago might forget it's own name.

934
01:28:25,397 --> 01:28:27,297
我们得走了
We have to go.

935
01:28:27,322 --> 01:28:29,758
叫上克里斯蒂娜 在外面碰头
Get Christina and meet me outside.

936
01:28:30,466 --> 01:28:32,224

You've been watching me for years and you don't know anything about me.

945
01:29:16,552 --> 01:29:19,819
你打算清除芝加哥城里所有人的记忆
You're wiping the memories of everyone in Chicago, aren't you?

There has to be a way to shut off the gas.

1074
01:41:49,046 --> 01:41:51,178
我会抓住你的 皮特
I will find you, Peter.

1075
01:41:58,879 --> 01:42:00,545
托比亚斯
Tobias.

1076
01:42:00,770 --> 01:42:02,318
没事了
You're okay.

1077
01:42:02,908 --> 01:42:04,436
该死
Damn it!

1078
01:42:04,540 --> 01:42:06,763
- 能关掉吗  - 不行
- Can you stop it? - No.

1079
01:42:20,733 --> 01:42:22,561
凯莱布 听得见吗
Caleb, do you hear me?

1080
01:42:23,115 --> 01:42:25,218
凯莱布 你在哪儿
Caleb, where are you?

1081
01:42:30,872 --> 01:42:32,690
凯莱布·普勒尔
Caleb Prior!

1082
01:42:38,011 --> 01:42:39,436
抱歉
Sorry.

1083
01:42:45,396 --> 01:42:47,861
继续跟着我
Keep going.Stay with me.

1084
01:42:51,943 --> 01:42:53,720
翠丝 看看这个 非常精确
Tris, look at this.It's really smart.

1085
01:42:53,745 --> 01:42:55,018
它们顺着通风管在空气中扩散
So, they ran the pipe into the air duck.

1086
01:42:55,043 --> 01:42:57,014
凯莱布 说重点 薄弱点在哪儿
Caleb, focus.Just tell me where it is.

1087
01:42:57,039 --> 01:42:59,719
就在这儿 这儿有个独立阀门控制空气流通
It's right here. There's an isolation valve that controls the flow of the air.

1088
01:42:59,744 --> 01:43:01,864
但我不知道怎么去那儿
But, I don't know how you're going to get down there.

1089
01:43:01,889 --> 01:43:04,057
我来 老四
I do.Four!

1090
01:43:09,838 --> 01:43:11,162
走
Go!

1091
01:43:20,245 --> 01:43:23,216
翠丝 在走廊的尽头
Tris, it's at the end of the hall.

1092
01:43:35,040 --> 01:43:37,121
关上门
Close the doors.

1093
01:43:47,651 --> 01:43:50,317
翠丝 我控制着一切事物
Tris, I control everything.

1094
01:43:50,342 --> 01:43:52,652
我甚至能立刻把你锁在这个房间里
I can even seal the room you're in right now.

1095
01:43:52,677 --> 01:43:54,852
直到你停止反抗
Just stop fighting.

1096
01:43:54,877 --> 01:43:57,122
还有一条路 下楼梯
There's another way.Down the stairs.

1097
01:44:00,738 --> 01:44:05,014
真是愚蠢 打住吧 我造就了你
This is foolish, just stop.I made you.

1098
01:44:05,039 --> 01:44:09,286
你就像我的孩子一样 你现在的一举一动
You might as well be my child.Which is what you're acting like.

1099
01:44:09,311 --> 01:44:11,657
淘气得都没边儿了
A spoil child.

1100
01:44:11,682 --> 01:44:14,951
翠丝 在走廊尽头 有另外一条路可以到梯子那儿
Tris, at the end of the hall.There's another way on the left.

1101
01:44:18,616 --> 01:44:20,768
都结束了 翠丝
It's over, Tris.

1102
01:44:24,917 --> 01:44:26,795

1106
01:44:39,490 --> 01:44:41,205
找到了
There you are.

1107
01:44:49,136 --> 01:44:52,082
你说得对 大卫 都结束了
You're right, David.It is over.

1108
01:45:00,959 --> 01:45:02,711
不
NO!

1109
01:45:05,418 --> 01:45:07,970
<font color="#ff80c0">血清释放终止</font>
<font color="#ff80c0">Serum release halted.</font>

1110
01:45:07,995 --> 01:45:09,986
缺陷者表现如何
How's that for "damaged".

1111
01:45:27,150 --> 01:45:28,562
<font color="#ff80c0">安全</font>
<font color="#ff80c0">Clear.</font>

1112
01:45:31,180 --> 01:45:32,787
安全了
It's clear.

1113
01:45:32,812 --> 01:45:34,485


1114

<font color="#ff80c0">Clear.</font>

<font color="#ff80c0">Clear.</font>

1116
01:45:55,455 --> 01:45:57,117
成功了
We did it.

1117
01:45:58,041 --> 01:46:00,157
这才是该为家人做的
That's what you do for family.

1118
01:46:10,013 --> 01:46:13,037
凯莱布 还有件事你得帮我去做
Caleb, there's one more thing I want you to do.

1119
01:46:13,062 --> 01:46:15,458
我想给大卫发条信息
I want to send a message to David.

1120
01:46:28,405 --> 01:46:30,891
我是翠丝·普勒尔
My name Tris Prior.

1121
01:46:31,383 --> 01:46:34,021
我今天在这儿要揭露一个真相
And I'm here to reveal the truth.

1122
01:46:34,423 --> 01:46:36,658
这个星球上的确还有其他人类存在
There are others who exist on this planet

1123
01:46:36,683 --> 01:46:38,828
可他们并没有平等地对待我们
They do not view us as equals.

1124
01:46:38,853 --> 01:46:44,015
他们称自己为纯净者 称我们为缺陷者
They called themselves the "Pure",and they called us the "damaged".

1125
01:46:44,387 --> 01:46:47,223
他们用围墙将我们与他们隔离开来
They created a wall to divide us from their world.

1126
01:46:47,248 --> 01:46:50,539
用派系将我们彼此分开
And factions to divide us from each other.

1127
01:46:52,211 --> 01:46:55,387
有人吗 得了
Hello!Come on!

1128
01:46:56,281 --> 01:46:59,289
你觉得这样就能把我一脚踢开是吗
You think you can ditch me like this?

1129
01:46:59,878 --> 01:47:02,129
让我替你干尽那些缺德事
You got me to do your dirty work

1130
01:47:02,154 --> 01:47:06,150
然后像甩掉他们一样想把我也甩掉
and then just, wiped me away like the rest of them!

1131
01:47:06,175 --> 01:47:08,234
我们不是说好的吗 朋友
We had a deal, pal!

1132
01:47:08,259 --> 01:47:11,389
我们成了试验品 这几乎毁了我们
We're their experiment,and it almost destroyed us.

1133
01:47:11,414 --> 01:47:14,703
我把自动驾驶仪设在了我们朋友的附近
I set the autopilot right for our friend's neighbourhood.

1134
01:47:16,299 --> 01:47:20,241
当它穿越伪装墙的时候会给他们一个小小的惊喜
Along with a little surprise when it goes through the camouflage wall.

1135
01:47:25,046 --> 01:47:27,884
他们企图让我们忘记自己是谁
They tried to make us forget who we are

1136
01:47:27,908 --> 01:47:32,126
来自何处 但他们没有成功
and where we're from,but they did not succeed.

1137
01:47:33,039 --> 01:47:35,722
所以我们能站在这儿团结一致
So, here we stand together,

1138
01:47:35,747 --> 01:47:39,444
不是作为五大派系 而是作为一座城市
not as 5 factions,but as one city.

1139
01:47:39,469 --> 01:47:41,753
我们要推翻他们建立的围墙
We're gonna tear down their wall.

1140
01:47:41,778 --> 01:47:44,082
怎么了
Hey.What's going on?

1141
01:47:50,553 --> 01:47:53,005
我就想住顶楼
I want the penthouse!

1142
01:47:53,030 --> 01:47:56,278
是的 没错
Yeah, that's right!

1143
01:47:59,780 --> 01:48:01,327
或者
Or...

1144
01:48:01,352 --> 01:48:04,920
跟上面一样酷的房间也行
a room in that really cool upstairs area.

1145
01:48:08,692 --> 01:48:10,558
好吧 听着
Okay, look!

1146
01:48:10,962 --> 01:48:13,872
我会回我以前住的地方去的
I'll even take my old bunk back!

1147
01:48:14,242 --> 01:48:18,953
只要快点把这该死的门给我打开
Just come on and open the damn door!

1148
01:48:18,978 --> 01:48:21,061
求你了
Please!

1149
01:48:37,332 --> 01:48:42,204
过去你们看着我们 现在我们看着你们
You've seen us,and now, we see you.

1150
01:48:47,844 --> 01:48:49,685
墙外的人你们现在听好了
To those of you beyond the wall,

1151
01:48:49,710 --> 01:48:53,247
我知道你们正在听
hear me loud and clear,because I know you are listening.

1152
01:48:54,237 --> 01:48:57,241
芝加哥不是你们的实验室
Chicago is not your experiment.

1153
01:48:57,266 --> 01:48:59,337
它是我们的家园
It is our home.

1154
01:48:59,362 --> 01:49:01,683
永远都是
And it always will be.

1155
01:49:07,131 --> 01:49:13,149
