格爾族們都是乳糖不耐癥

This planet may be a bit of a fixing-it-upper...

86
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:27,200
但還好啦
but that is okay.

87
00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:31,030
波波人很擅長區分什麼是精華
Boov are best at deciding what is useful.

88
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,330

89
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:34,670

歡迎回家 好鄰居
Welcome home, neighbors!

98
00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:27,550
波波人沒有鄰居
Boov do not have "neighbors."

99
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:31,810
這是因為之前星球的大小和地貌

00:08:13,990 --> 00:08:16,000
行啦 媽媽 就是點雪而已
Come on, Mom. It's just snow.

116
00:08:16,030 --> 00:08:17,610
我可不懂什麼雪
I don't know anything about snow.

117
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:20,170
我們來自巴巴多斯 那兒可不下雪
We're from Barbados! We don't have snow!

We can't wait for Mom, Pig. We gotta go.

122

123
00:09:20,890 --> 00:09:21,440

This is what you get for stealing planets and abducting people.

201
00:16:40,910 --> 00:16:42,620
你想錯了

I know the fugitive Boov has made yet another in a series of horrible...

- And we're out. - We are doomed!

228
00:18:17,970 --> 00:18:20,350
格爾族會再次找到我們的
The Gorg are going to find us again!

229
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:22,730
那個瘋子波波搞砸了一切
The maniac Boov has ruined everything.

230
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:24,840
糟透了

我需要主意
I want ideas.

244
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:01,630
我們可以創造一個沒有格爾族的替換現實
We could create an alternate reality with no Gorg in it...

245
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:03,560
然後住到那兒去

246
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,940
好耶 我喜歡

247
00:19:05,970 --> 00:19:07,350
這麼做需要多久
How long would that take?

248
00:19:07,390 --> 00:19:09,390
基於目前的科技
Based on our current technology...

249
00:19:11,310 --> 00:19:13,060
1700萬年
1.7 million years.

250
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:15,990
這可太久啦 托尼 換別的
That's a lot of years, Toni. Moving on!

251
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:18,200

- We could lay on the ground... - Yes!

252
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:21,410
讓格爾族以為我們都死了
and make the Gorg think we are dead.

253
00:19:24,450 --> 00:19:25,660
下一個
Next!

254
00:19:26,410 --> 00:19:28,870
我們幹嘛不登陸逃亡波波的電郵
What if we logged into the fugitive Boov's email...

255
00:19:28,910 --> 00:19:30,330
然後取消他的電子邀請
and cancelled his e-vite--

256
00:19:30,370 --> 00:19:33,960
噓噓 或者我們登陸逃亡者的電郵賬號
Shush! Or we could log into the fugitive Boov's email...

257
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,710
取消邀請
and cancel his invitation, and...

258
00:19:37,170 --> 00:19:38,080
然後怎麼著
What was that?

259
00:19:38,130 --> 00:19:39,750
格爾族絕不會收到邀請
So the Gorg never receive it.

260
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:42,310
格爾族絕不會收到邀請
So the Gorg never receive it!

261
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:46,430
現在輸入密碼 取消信息
Now, type in the password and cancel that message.

262
00:19:46,470 --> 00:19:50,060
把密碼設成"密碼"真是個好主意啊
It was a good idea of me to make all passwords "password."

263
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:51,180
容易記憶
It's so easy to remember.

264
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:56,440
沒有用 他的密碼太獨特
It did not work! His password is unique.

265
00:19:57,070 --> 00:19:57,990
不
No!

266
00:19:58,030 --> 00:20:01,410
獨特 波波人不獨特
Unique? Boov are not unique!

267
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:04,070
把我的充氣機取來
Fetch me my inhaler.

268
00:20:10,330 --> 00:20:12,080
小子們 這會奏效的
Boy, that works.

269
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:14,500
他的錯誤會直接把格爾族引過來
His mistaking is leading the Gorg right to us.

270
00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:15,710
讓我看看他的請帖

275
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:26,060
看看我的氣球 派對

278
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:32,730

414
00:29:40,650 --> 00:29:43,900
好 你在千鈞一髮之際救了我們
Yes! You has in nick-time saved us!

415
00:29:46,410 --> 00:29:48,080
你這表情是什麼意思
What is the purpose of your face?

416
00:29:48,910 --> 00:29:49,660
好痛
Owpain.

417
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:51,240
你想要丟下我
You were gonna ditch me?

418
00:29:51,290 --> 00:29:52,380
- 不  - 騙子
- No! - Liar!

419
00:29:52,410 --> 00:29:53,910
我從不說謊
I never lie!

420
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:54,790
你說了
Yes, you do!

421
00:29:55,370 --> 00:29:56,540
你知道 我是怎麼知道的嗎
And you know how I know?

422
00:29:56,580 --> 00:30:00,080
因為每當你說謊的時候 你就會變綠
Because every time you lie, you turn green!

423
00:30:00,130 --> 00:30:01,630
我沒有 我...
I doos not. I...

424
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:03,050
拆穿了
Poomp.

425
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:10,480
開門 騙子 長著一張青蛙臉的濕玩具
Open the door, you lying, frog-faced squishy toy!

426
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:12,230
停 我需要你...
Stop! I need your...

427
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:16,350
你承諾過要幫我找到我媽媽
You promised to help me find my mom!

428
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:18,030
然後我要違背承諾
Then I un-promise!

429
00:30:18,060 --> 00:30:19,600
不能這樣
That's not how it works!

430
00:30:20,110 --> 00:30:22,490
你必須幫我去巴黎
You have to help me get to Paris.

431
00:30:22,530 --> 00:30:24,370
我不幫
I will not!

432
00:30:26,410 --> 00:30:27,870
停 我需要你...
Stop! I need your...

433
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:34,210
我必須藏起來
I must hide!

434
00:30:34,250 --> 00:30:37,340
我也說的英語 你為什麼就不明白呢
I am speaking the English at you. Whyfor do you not understands me?

435
00:30:37,370 --> 00:30:40,500
我理解 我只是不在乎而已
I "understands." I just don't care.

436
00:30:41,250 --> 00:30:42,370
- 別動  - 當心
- Freezing! - Look out!

437
00:30:50,970 --> 00:30:51,590
不要
Come on!

438
00:30:54,180 --> 00:30:57,760
停 我需要你的密碼
Stop! I need your password.

439
00:31:01,020 --> 00:31:01,810
不
No!

440
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:02,610
跑
Go!

441
00:31:21,250 --> 00:31:23,750
我就是想要個密碼
All I wanted was his password.

442
00:31:28,430 --> 00:31:31,310
這並不是一個能忍受的友誼方式
This is not a sustainable friendship model.

443
00:31:56,950 --> 00:31:58,410
所以...
So...

444
00:31:58,460 --> 00:32:03,260
我假設現在我們已經逮捕了亡命大盜
I assume by now we have apprehended the fugitive.

445
00:32:03,590 --> 00:32:05,220
有人嗎
Anybody?

446
00:32:05,250 --> 00:32:07,170
你 紫色的那個
You. The purple one.

447
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:11,630
不是這個紫色的 是另一個紫色的 另一個
Not that purple. The other purple. The other purple.

448
00:32:13,470 --> 00:32:14,420
那個
That one.

449
00:32:14,470 --> 00:32:15,300
對 就是你
Yes, you!

450
00:32:15,850 --> 00:32:17,440
所以 他在哪
So, where is he?

451
00:32:17,810 --> 00:32:19,230
我們不知道 先生
We do not know, sir.

452
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:21,730
什麼 這是第一名的災難
What? This is number one disaster!

453
00:32:21,770 --> 00:32:24,230
他的郵件可千萬不能被格爾族看到
His message must not reach the Gorg.

454
00:32:24,270 --> 00:32:27,940
這個星球可是千辛萬苦找到的 我絕不放棄它
This planet was hard to find, and I will not abandon it!

455
00:32:27,990 --> 00:32:31,240
把我的壓力釋放泡泡墊拿來
Someone fetch me my stress blankie.

456
00:32:35,870 --> 00:32:37,830
太爽了
So soothing.

457
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:42,950
凱爾警長來啦
Aha! Officer Kyle!

458
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:46,090
總算來了一個盡職盡責的波波人
Now here is a Boov who knows how to do his job.

459
00:32:46,130 --> 00:32:48,470
你一定會告訴我找到逃犯了對不對
Tell me, you have found the fugitive?

460
00:32:48,510 --> 00:32:49,800
是的
Yes.

461
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:51,720
這絕對是普天同慶的歷史時刻
Joyful exclamation!

462
00:32:54,260 --> 00:32:55,840
他在哪兒勒
And where is he?

463
00:32:57,350 --> 00:32:59,400
發生了一丟丟的問題
There is a tiny problem.

464
00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:05,400
既然只是 "一丟丟" 那誰還在乎呢
"Tiny." As long as it's tiny, who cares?

465
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:08,700
就在我獲得密碼之前
Well, before I got the password...

466
00:33:09,570 --> 00:33:11,490
他溜了
I erased him.

467
00:33:15,490 --> 00:33:18,490
來晚會吧 來晚會吧 來晚會吧
Come party. Come party. Come party.

468
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:24,500
- 輕點啊  - 對不起啦
- Quit it! - Sorry.

469
00:33:24,540 --> 00:33:26,790
聽著 對你我來說巴黎很危險
Look, Paris is danger for both of us.

470
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:29,010
那裏到處都是波波人
It crawls with Boov.

471
00:33:29,050 --> 00:33:32,220
我們到了那兒之後你有什麼計劃
Doos you have a plan for once we are get there?

472
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:35,350
暫時沒想好 但我還是有勝算的
Not really. But I have hope.

473
00:33:36,010 --> 00:33:37,800
你數學是體育老師教的嗎
You are bad at math.

474
00:33:37,850 --> 00:33:38,730
你說什麼
Excuse me?

475
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:40,640
我幾何學可是拿過 "A" 的好嗎
I got an "A" in geometry.

476
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:42,140
我的意思是
I am only saying...

477
00:33:42,180 --> 00:33:44,680
波波族在數學上的造詣是你們不能比的
Boov are superior in this way.

478
00:33:45,020 --> 00:33:49,020
只要勝算低於50%
If probability for success falls below 50%...

479
00:33:50,690 --> 00:33:53,360
波波族就放棄 你們就不會
Boov give up. You do not.

480
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:54,270
確實如此
Exactly!

481
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:56,860
不要再撕了
Enough with the ripping!

482
00:33:56,910 --> 00:33:58,330
好的 好的
Okay, okay.

483
00:33:58,370 --> 00:34:00,250
要不這樣吧 我們聽聽音樂
Tell you what. Let's have some tuneage.

484
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:09,420
那是什麼
What is that?

485
00:34:09,460 --> 00:34:11,330
波波樂
Boov song.

486
00:34:11,380 --> 00:34:13,510
歌名叫 "靜止與服從"
It is called "Motionless and Obedient."

487
00:34:13,550 --> 00:34:14,510
超流行的單曲
Very big hit.

488
00:34:14,550 --> 00:34:17,020
不不不 在我的車裏不允許放這種音樂
No, no, no! Not in my car.

489
00:34:17,050 --> 00:34:18,420
司機才有選擇權
Driver gets to pick.

490
00:34:22,270 --> 00:34:25,070
這甚至都不能稱之為音樂好嗎 這是噪音
This is not even music. This is just noise.

491
00:34:34,780 --> 00:34:37,200
這種身體反應絕非我意
Involuntary physical response.

492
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:37,900
你騙我
You have tricked me

493
00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:40,790
聽這種聲波武器讓我變得虛弱
into listening to a debilitating sonic weapon.

494
00:34:40,830 --> 00:34:43,920
如果你想讓人類不討厭你的話
If you want humans to not hate you...

495
00:34:43,950 --> 00:34:46,330
那你可以從喜歡我們人類的事物開始做起
you could start by liking some of our stuff.

496
00:34:51,340 --> 00:34:54,090
這太奇怪了 我的身體是怎麼了
Confusion. What is happening to my body?

497
00:34:54,130 --> 00:34:55,630
這叫跳舞
It's called dancing!

498
00:34:55,670 --> 00:34:57,710
波波族才不會跳舞呢
Boov do not dancing!

499
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:00,390
我看出來啦 但你技巧掌握得還蠻快的嘛
I can tell. But you're getting the hang of it!

500
00:35:00,430 --> 00:35:02,390
我要被它折磨瘋了
How long before this kills me?

501
00:35:02,430 --> 00:35:05,140
我完全不能控制我的須須們了
I am not in control of my own extremities!

502
00:35:05,180 --> 00:35:07,430
就是這樣 動起來
That's it. Work it!

503
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:08,900
我不想動哇
I do not want it to work!

504
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:09,860
你知道嗎
You know what?

505
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:12,390
"波波" 和 "樂樂" 押韻
"Boov" rhymes with "groove."

506
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:14,350
搖擺搖擺 快樂搖擺
Shake your Boov thang.

507
00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:17,110
我的屁屁搖擺得不甚優雅啊
It is shaking in a most undignified way!

508
00:35:17,950 --> 00:35:21,450
哦不 我的手在飛舞 就像我不在乎
Oh, no! My hands are in the air like I just do not care!

509
00:35:21,780 --> 00:35:23,820
這不應該是波波人應有的表現啊
This is not how a Boov behaves!

510
00:35:23,870 --> 00:35:25,630
羞恥感讓我渾身發燙
I am overheated with shame!

511
00:35:25,660 --> 00:35:27,580
- 我必須冷卻一下  - 等等
- I must cool my core! - Wait!

512
00:35:27,620 --> 00:35:30,040
- 你在做什麼  - 我會回來的
- What are you doing? - I will returning!

513
00:35:30,790 --> 00:35:32,000
我們正玩兒得開心呢
We were having fun!

514
00:35:51,150 --> 00:35:52,940
快來 媽媽 只是雪而已啦
Come on, Mom. It's just snow!

515
00:35:52,980 --> 00:35:54,890
我從來沒有見過雪
I don't know anything about snow.

516
00:35:55,980 --> 00:35:57,230
這是我們的第一場雪
Our first snow!

517
00:36:00,490 --> 00:36:01,790
你還好嗎
Are you okay?

518
00:36:01,820 --> 00:36:02,990
我要把這寄給
I'm sending this to--

519
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:06,160
我的體溫已恢復到快樂的水平
My temperature is back to happiness.

520
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:09,620
為了表示我對你沒有任何的不滿
And to show I do not hold against you any grudge-ment...

521
00:36:09,670 --> 00:36:12,380
我給你帶來了可口的點心
I have brought you delicious snacking.

522
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:14,510
看 有嚼勁的塑料環
Fa-da! Chewy plastic rings!

523
00:36:17,170 --> 00:36:19,840
我真心不喜歡你們人類的感謝方式
I really do not enjoy your human gratitude customs.

524
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:21,130
你去哪兒了
Where have you been?

525
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:22,470
你就那麼永遠得走掉了
You were gone forever!

526
00:36:22,510 --> 00:36:24,300
這句話並不準確 "永遠" 指的是
That is not accurate. "Forever" is--

527
00:36:24,350 --> 00:36:26,690
我還以為你死了或者受傷了
I thought you were dead! Or hurt!

528
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:28,800
或者遇到其他什麼事
Or I don't know!

529
00:36:28,850 --> 00:36:31,720
你絕不可以像這樣把一個人單獨留下
But you cannot just leave someone alone like that!

530
00:36:31,770 --> 00:36:33,850
把腳放在我的鞋子裏
Put yourself in my shoes!

531
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:35,740
我怎麼可能穿你的鞋子
How could I wears your shoes?

532
00:36:35,770 --> 00:36:37,190
我的腳太小了
My pods are too small.

533
00:36:37,230 --> 00:36:38,560
這只是一種措辭
It's an expression!

534
00:36:38,610 --> 00:36:41,980
意思是你要設身處地為別人著想
It means try to feel how someone else feels.

535
00:36:42,030 --> 00:36:43,440
我還只是個孩子
I'm just a kid.

536
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:46,070
我不應該總是自己承擔一切
I'm not supposed to be by myself all the time.

537
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:50,000
這簡直就是孩子的危機 同時也是一種犯罪
This is child endangerment. Which is a crime, by the way.

538
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:52,670
但是我見到你的時候你就已經是一個人了呀
But when I founded you, you were already alone...

539
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:54,590
所以我以為對你來說這很正常
so I thinks it is normal for you.

540
00:36:54,630 --> 00:36:57,130
小波波們都是在恆溫爐裏養大的
When Boov are young, we are kept in the warming oven.

541
00:37:03,550 --> 00:37:06,010
這對人類來說正常嗎
Is this normal for humanspersons?

542
00:37:06,050 --> 00:37:06,550
通常
Usually

543
00:37:06,550 --> 00:37:11,050
我們只有滿了16歲才會獨自橫跨大西洋
We don't cross the Atlantic by ourselves until we're 16.

544
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:13,530
不 發生的這些事都不正常
No, none of this is normal!

545
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:16,560
你還沒明白嗎 你毀了一切
Don't you get it? You ruined everything!

546
00:37:16,610 --> 00:37:20,950
本來我終於在這兒找到了快樂
I was finally happy here-- there, where I lived.

547
00:37:20,990 --> 00:37:22,330
和媽媽一起居住的地方
With my mom.

548
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:25,250
你知道對我來說適應有多困難
Do you know how hard it was for me to fit in?

549
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:26,860
我用了多久才習慣
How long that took?

550
00:37:26,910 --> 00:37:29,210
七年級的女生都不好惹
7th-grade girls are mean!

551
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:31,530
是 我發現了 我之前都沒意識到
Yes, I sees that! I did not realize!

552
00:37:31,580 --> 00:37:35,050
我們會重新找邁瑪的
We will resume the finding of Mimom.

553
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:36,910
別再這麼說了好嗎
Stop saying that!

554
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:39,460
她是我的媽媽
She's just "my" mom.

555
00:37:39,510 --> 00:37:41,720
不是你的 是我的
Not yours. Mine.

556
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:44,310
你為什麼就是搞不清楚呢
How do you not understand this?

557
00:37:44,340 --> 00:37:45,300
如果長相怪異的外星人
How would you feel

558
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:48,570
把你媽媽從你身邊帶走 你會做何感想
if some horrible aliens took your mother from you?

559
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:51,060
這不可能發生
That could not to happen.

560
00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:53,110
波波人沒有邁瑪
Boov are not having mimoms.

561
00:37:54,690 --> 00:37:56,990
原來你們沒有家人
Boov don't have families.

562
00:37:58,270 --> 00:38:01,460
怪不得你們搶奪別人的東西而且一點也不在乎別人的感受
No wonder you take things and don't care about anybody else.

563
00:38:06,110 --> 00:38:09,070
所以說 你的邁瑪
So, your mimom...

564
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:12,080
對你來說非常重要
is a very important humansperson to you.

565
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:14,910
比任何人都重要
More important than others.

566
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:19,010
不能和她在一起的話 你就會傷心
To not belong with her causes you being sad.

567
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:26,430
但是剛剛你還在對我拳打腳踢 衝我叫喊
But recent moments ago, you are kicking on me and yelling.

568
00:38:26,470 --> 00:38:30,480
看起來不是傷心 而是生氣
Which is seeming more to be mad than sad.

569
00:38:31,270 --> 00:38:34,690
有時兩者皆有
Well, sometimes it's both.

570
00:38:36,980 --> 00:38:39,280
所以你是傷心地生氣
So, you are sad-mad.

571
00:38:51,830 --> 00:38:55,210
原來人類比書上說的複雜得多
Humans are more complicated than it said in the pamphlet.

572
00:39:02,550 --> 00:39:04,390
我盡快地把這兒用吸塵器打掃乾淨了
I vacuumed here as fast as I could.

573
00:39:05,510 --> 00:39:06,120
你們對
Whatfor is your plan

574
00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:08,180
破解密碼有了什麼想法
for figuring out the dumb Boov's password?

575
00:39:08,510 --> 00:39:09,670
我沒什麼收穫
I got nothing!

576
00:39:10,850 --> 00:39:13,100
拜託 我需要大家的想法
Please, come on! I need ideas!

577
00:39:13,140 --> 00:39:15,150
就是你 紫色的那個
You! The purple one.

578
00:39:18,060 --> 00:39:19,680
拜託
Oh, come on!

579
00:39:20,860 --> 00:39:21,990
所以勒
So?

580
00:39:22,020 --> 00:39:26,980
也許我們可以隨機地輸入數字和字母
We could type in random numbers and letters?

581
00:39:28,070 --> 00:39:29,190
贊
I like it!

582
00:39:30,370 --> 00:39:33,160
超級大腦們快快連接工作起來
Get those big brains plugged in and working.

583
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:34,360
走著
Away!

584
00:39:35,370 --> 00:39:37,870
你們知道一旦格爾人發現我們 下場會怎樣
You know what the Gorg will do if they find us.

585
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:39,000
喀嚓 喀嚓 喀嚓
Chomp, chomp, chomp.

586
00:39:43,380 --> 00:39:45,680
所以我們才要一直逃亡
And that is why we keep running away.

587
00:39:46,220 --> 00:39:47,300
哇噢
Whoa.

588
00:39:47,340 --> 00:39:49,380
為什麼格爾族那麼恨你們
Why do these Gorg hate you so much?

589
00:39:49,430 --> 00:39:50,810
因為他們是格爾人啊
Because they are Gorg.

590
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:53,300
我們稱他們為 "掠奪者"
We calls Gorg the "takers"...

591
00:39:53,350 --> 00:39:56,690
因為你有什麼 他們就搶什麼
because if you has something, they takes it.

592
00:39:56,730 --> 00:39:58,650
比如你有一塊三明治
Like, if you has a sandwich.

593
00:39:58,690 --> 00:39:59,980
或一個星球
Or a planet.

594
00:40:00,020 --> 00:40:01,980
好啦 好啦 我理解了
No, no. I get it.

595
00:40:02,020 --> 00:40:04,020
但他們不會來地球 對吧
But they're not coming to this planet, right?

596
00:40:04,070 --> 00:40:05,740
不不 這倒不用擔心
Oh, no, no. Not to worry.

597
00:40:05,780 --> 00:40:09,200
超級大腦波波人會彌補我的失誤的
The Big Brain Boov will to fix my mistake.

598
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:11,200
但我還是會被處罰得很慘
But I will still be very punished.

599
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:13,000
我們有項規定
We has a rule.

600
00:40:13,030 --> 00:40:15,570
違規九次即出局
Nine mistakes and you are out.

601
00:40:15,620 --> 00:40:17,420
那你犯規了幾次
How many mistakes do you have?

602
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:19,370
62次
62.

603
00:40:23,750 --> 00:40:27,210
我情緒低落的時候 媽媽就會給我講笑話
When I'm stressed out, my mom tells me jokes.

604
00:40:27,710 --> 00:40:30,210
波波人不會講笑話
Boov do not do telling jokes.

605
00:40:30,260 --> 00:40:32,180
沒那麼難 我來教你吧
It's not that hard. I'll teach you.

606
00:40:32,220 --> 00:40:33,100
咚 咚
Knock, knock.

607
00:40:34,390 --> 00:40:36,440
你應該說  " 門外是誰 「
You would say, "Who's there?"

608
00:40:38,770 --> 00:40:40,070
是你
You are there.

609
00:40:40,100 --> 00:40:41,720
不 你只要問我就好了
No, just ask me.

610
00:40:41,770 --> 00:40:42,720
門外是誰
Who is there?

611
00:40:42,770 --> 00:40:45,520
現在我說  "打斷牛」
Now I say, "The interrupting cow."

612
00:40:45,570 --> 00:40:48,570
現在你說  "誰是打斷牛 「
Now you say, "The interrupting cow, who?"

613
00:40:48,610 --> 00:40:49,730
我們開始吧
Let's just do it.

614
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:52,200
- 咚 咚   - 門外是誰
- Knock, knock. - Who is there?

615
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:54,120
打斷牛
The interrupting cow.

616
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:56,710
- 打斷牛  - 哞
- The interrupting cow-- - Moo!

617
00:40:56,740 --> 00:40:58,910
我還沒問你呢
You did not let me finish my response.

618
00:40:58,950 --> 00:41:02,080
- 我剛才應該說 "哪個打斷-- "  -哞
- I was to say, "The interrupting co--" - Moo!

619
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:03,660
你又那麼干
You did it again.

620
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:07,750
這是個玩笑
That is the joke.

621
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:10,760
這隻牛是打斷牛
The cow is to being an interrupting cow...

622
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:12,930
所以在我說話時打斷了
and therefore interrupts me!

623
00:41:12,970 --> 00:41:15,390
- 我知道 這就是它有趣的地方  - 哞
- I know. That's why it's funny. - Moo!

624
00:41:15,430 --> 00:41:17,140
-讓我說--  -哞
- Let me fi-- - Moo!

625
00:41:17,180 --> 00:41:18,890
-夠了  - 我是打斷牛
- That's enough. - I'm the interrupting cow.

626
00:41:18,930 --> 00:41:20,600
- 住口  - 哞
- Knock it off! - Moo!

627
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:22,680
-別逼我用膠帶封上你的嘴啊  -哞
- Don't make me get out more tape! - Moo!

628
00:41:31,150 --> 00:41:33,530
好多波波啊
So many Boovs!

629
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:35,780
我說過這太傻了
I said this was dumbness.

630
00:41:35,820 --> 00:41:38,570
我說過我是命中注定的 但是你聽了嗎 沒有
I said I am doomed. But doos you listen? No!

631
00:41:38,620 --> 00:41:39,620
夠了
Oh, that's enough!

632
00:41:39,660 --> 00:41:41,620
你快把我逼瘋了
You are driving me to the crazy!

633
00:41:41,660 --> 00:41:44,870
現在跑還不晚 那是波波族的格言
It is never too late to run away. That is the Boov motto.

634
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:47,960
是的 但是我們不會逃跑 我有一個計劃
Yes, but we're not doing that. I have a plan.

635
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:51,130
你的計劃是逃跑嗎 如果不是 那都是蠢方法
Is your plan to run away? Because other-way-wise, it is stupid!

636
00:41:51,170 --> 00:41:53,090
我們需要做的就是潛入這個城市
All we have to do is sneak into the city...

637
00:41:53,130 --> 00:41:56,090
進入偉大的天線 利用它來找到我媽媽
get into the Great Antenna, use it to find my mom...

638
00:41:56,140 --> 00:41:58,310
然後再偷偷溜走 明白了嗎
and then sneak out again. See?

639
00:41:58,350 --> 00:42:01,520
但是這樣還是行不通呀 因為他們認識我
But it still will not work because my face is known.

640
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:03,980
如果我被任何一個波波看到
If I am seen by any Boov,

641
00:42:03,980 --> 00:42:06,030
我百分之百會被抓起來的
I am 100% popular for being arrested.

642
00:42:07,690 --> 00:42:09,360
如果我有辦法呢
What if I could fix that?

643
00:42:24,540 --> 00:42:25,590
別動
Hold still.

644
00:42:27,170 --> 00:42:29,720
首先 一個小雀斑
First, a little beauty mark.

645
00:42:30,550 --> 00:42:32,180
讓我看看
Letting me see.

646
00:42:32,210 --> 00:42:33,880
-還沒好呢 把鏡子給我  - 給我 給我
- Not yet. Give me that mirror. - Give to me, give to me!

647
00:42:37,050 --> 00:42:40,180
這看起來完全不像我了
It is like looking at a completed stranger!

648
00:42:40,220 --> 00:42:42,300
不 我還沒完成呢 甚至還沒有--
No, I'm not done. It's not even--

649
00:42:42,350 --> 00:42:45,520
你真是個魔術師
You are a worker of miraculous transformation!

650
00:42:45,560 --> 00:42:47,140
這個波波是誰
Who is this Boov?

651
00:42:47,190 --> 00:42:48,610
我不認識
I do not know!

652
00:42:49,730 --> 00:42:50,940
好吧 哇哦
All right, Oh.

653
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:54,400
好痛
Owpain.

654
00:43:13,590 --> 00:43:15,600
電梯離開
Express elevator departing.

655
00:43:29,270 --> 00:43:29,970
哇哦
Whoa!

656
00:43:30,440 --> 00:43:32,570
這太令人興奮了
This is uber freaky

657
00:43:32,610 --> 00:43:35,120
這些都是最聰明的波波嗎
These are the smartest Boov you have?

658
00:43:35,820 --> 00:43:37,950
你一定要安靜
You must be very quiet.

659
00:43:37,990 --> 00:43:39,620
你肯定不想打破他們集中--
You do not want to break their concentra--

660
00:43:42,580 --> 00:43:43,670
派對開始啦 派對開始啦
Come party. Come party.

661
00:43:45,450 --> 00:43:46,620
哦 這是什麼
Oh! What is it?

662
00:43:46,660 --> 00:43:49,790
我想現在大腦袋波波已經停止了
I thought the Big Brain Boovs would have stopped my invitation by now.

663
00:43:49,830 --> 00:43:51,750
但是他們還沒有找到我的密碼
But they have still not figured out my password.

664
00:43:51,790 --> 00:43:53,460
- 這可能嗎  - 等一下
- How is this possible? - Wait a minute.

665
00:43:53,500 --> 00:43:55,470
這是說這些可怕的格爾族惡魔
Does this mean those horrible monster Gorg thingies

666
00:43:55,470 --> 00:43:56,540
將要去地球了嗎
will come to Earth?

667
00:43:56,590 --> 00:43:58,140
去地球 是的
To Smekland, yes!

668
00:43:58,180 --> 00:43:59,430
然後會發生什麼
And what happens then?

669
00:44:01,930 --> 00:44:03,940
再也不會找到邁瑪了
There will be no finding of Mimom!

670
00:44:04,850 --> 00:44:06,440
你要解決這個問題
Then you've gotta fix this!

671
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:07,770
好
Yes.

672
00:44:09,140 --> 00:44:10,390
快點
Hurry!

673
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:12,320
順便問一下 你的頭骨靈活嗎
By to the way, is your skull flexible?

674
00:44:12,360 --> 00:44:13,280
- 啥  - 沒啥
- What? - Never mind.

675
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:14,650
可能沒什麼問題 別動
It will be probably okay. Hold still.

676
00:44:27,870 --> 00:44:29,030
哇哦
Wow!

677
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:34,790
還剩30秒就玩完啦
30 seconds to doom.

678
00:44:34,840 --> 00:44:36,840
我應該輸入我的密碼 密碼是
I shall input my password. It is...

679
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:39,310
" 我的名字是哎呀 斯邁克船長很偉大而且
"My name is Oh and Captain Smek is great and

680
00:44:39,340 --> 00:44:41,800
任何人都不會想到的是1
anyone who does not think that is a poomp 1."

681
00:44:41,840 --> 00:44:43,470
我想知道為什麼沒人會猜到
I wonder why no one guessed that.

682
00:44:43,510 --> 00:44:44,630
我也不知道
I do not know.

683
00:44:46,350 --> 00:44:48,020
- 不管用嗎  - 不可能
- It didn't work? - Impossible!

684
00:44:48,060 --> 00:44:49,110
這就是密碼呀
That is password!

儘管你精心偽裝

00:47:23,010 --> 00:47:25,800
電腦已經認出你是

- So, I still has to erase you. - Why?

740
00:47:51,530 --> 00:47:53,820
你不能保證你不會再次犯錯
You cannot guarantee you would not make a mistake again.

741
00:47:53,870 --> 00:47:55,630
- 但是我不會  - 但是你可能會

742
00:47:55,660 --> 00:47:56,830
- 但是我不會  - 但是你可能會
- But I would not. - But you might.

743
00:47:56,870 --> 00:47:57,780
但是我不會
But I would not.

744
00:47:57,830 --> 00:47:59,370
我們可以一直這麼說下去 再來一次
We could go round and round. Let's do it again!

745
00:47:59,420 --> 00:48:00,670
- 但是我不會  - 但是你可能會

放下泡泡槍
Drop the bubble guns!

751
00:48:13,890 --> 00:48:16,230
否則 我就會用這個
Or I will mess with this...

752
00:48:16,680 --> 00:48:18,640
有引力的東西造成混亂
gravity thingy.

753
00:48:18,690 --> 00:48:19,940
她在虛張聲勢
She is bluffing.

754
00:48:20,230 --> 00:48:23,030
她不可能夠到那個
She could not possibly reach the gravity thingy.

755
00:48:24,070 --> 00:48:26,280
詛咒你和你的腳趾頭
Curse you and your tippy-toe tallness!

756
00:48:27,240 --> 00:48:28,370
但是沒關係
But no problem.

757
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:30,850
波波的技術太複雜
Boov technology is far too complicated for

758
00:48:30,850 --> 00:48:33,860
人類小女孩不可能弄明白
simple humansgirl to figure out.

759
00:48:33,910 --> 00:48:35,250
是嗎
Excuse me?

760
00:48:36,910 --> 00:48:39,910
這個人類女孩可是幾何學拿到優等的
This humansgirl got an "A" in geometry.

761
00:48:43,590 --> 00:48:46,380
她破解出來啦! 逃命哪!
She figured it out! Run for my life!

762
00:48:48,050 --> 00:48:50,100
別擋道! 我是船長!
Out of my way! I am captain!

763
00:49:05,270 --> 00:49:06,270
抓緊!
Grab on!

764
00:49:07,230 --> 00:49:08,480
不! 我抓不住你啦!
Oh, no! I can't hold you!

765
00:49:09,240 --> 00:49:10,990
你像是有千磅重!
You weigh, like, a thousand pounds!

766
00:49:12,110 --> 00:49:12,900
鬆手吧

767
00:49:12,950 --> 00:49:14,790
- 什麼  - 相信我
- What? - Trust me.

768
00:49:21,420 --> 00:49:23,460
抱歉 我的職責是先逃跑
Sorry. It is my duty to run away first.

769
00:49:25,290 --> 00:49:26,080
呼
Poomp.

770
00:49:26,130 --> 00:49:28,090
- 你還在等什麼  - 我不能碰
- What are you waiting for? - I cannot touch.

771
00:49:28,130 --> 00:49:29,640
我操作它 它是不會有反應的
It will not work if I drive it.

772
00:49:30,470 --> 00:49:31,930
好吧 我來開
Fine. I'll drive.

773
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:38,310
好痛
Owpain.

774
00:49:42,640 --> 00:49:44,220
你開車技術好爛
You are terrible driver.

775
00:50:10,420 --> 00:50:11,420
來吧
Come on.

00:50:12,470 --> 00:50:13,810
來吧 來吧

(餐前語)祝你胃口好
Bon appetit.

778
00:50:15,300 --> 00:50:16,590
不 你不能了
Oh, no, you don't!

779
00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:18,140
我是不會付錢的
I am not paying for that.

780
00:50:36,490 --> 00:50:38,370
快動起來 你這匹蠢馬!
Come on, you stupid horse!

781
00:50:46,500 --> 00:50:47,840
唔 太帥了...
Whoo, that was cl--

782
00:50:58,390 --> 00:50:59,520
這次我抓住你了...
This time I got you...

783
00:50:59,560 --> 00:51:01,230
你跑不掉了
and you cannot escape.

784
00:51:01,970 --> 00:51:03,180
檢測到逃亡的波波
Fugitive Boov detected.

785
00:51:03,230 --> 00:51:04,190
我不是
I was wrong.

786
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:10,490
跳!
Jump!

787
00:51:10,520 --> 00:51:11,520
不!
Oh, no!

788
00:51:23,750 --> 00:51:25,630

789
00:51:25,660 --> 00:51:26,660
豬豬!

790
00:51:36,010 --> 00:51:38,390
我不明白你為什麼要帶上這個
I do not know whyfor you brought that.

791
00:51:38,430 --> 00:51:40,230
我們車裏已經有食物了
We already hads food in the car.

792
00:51:40,260 --> 00:51:42,260
這不是食物 這是藝術品
It's not food, it's art.

793
00:51:43,350 --> 00:51:44,900
那它不是好的藝術品
Then it is bad.

794
00:51:44,930 --> 00:51:47,180
星星不是那樣子的
Stars do not look like that.

795
00:51:47,230 --> 00:51:48,730
藝術品的價值不在於它看起來的樣子
It's not about how they look.

796
00:51:48,770 --> 00:51:50,890
而在於它帶給你的感覺
It's about how they feel.

797
00:51:51,270 --> 00:51:52,850
它們讓我感覺很熱
They feel hot.

798
00:51:54,030 --> 00:51:57,240
好了 數學天才 要多久我們能到澳大利亞
Okay, math whiz, how long till we get to Australia?

799
00:51:57,280 --> 00:51:59,450
17.9348個小時
17.9348 hours.

800
00:51:59,950 --> 00:52:01,750
然後 格拉托依蒂·圖琪
And then, Gratuity Tucci...

801
00:52:01,780 --> 00:52:03,240
就能見到邁瑪了
will see Mimom.

802
00:52:05,870 --> 00:52:07,080
你聽到了嗎 豬豬
You hear that, Pig?

803
00:52:07,120 --> 00:52:09,910
我等不及要告訴媽媽我真的來過巴黎了
I can't wait to tell Mom I actually went to Paris...

804
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:12,260
你知道的 她一直都想來巴黎
which you know she always wanted to do.

805
00:52:12,290 --> 00:52:14,420
也許我們可以一起回到這兒
Maybe we could both come back here.

806
00:52:14,460 --> 00:52:16,500
我們現在真的有一輛飛車了
We do have a flying car now.

807
00:52:16,550 --> 00:52:19,140
你會怎麼用法語說"貓咪"
How do you say "cat" in French?

808
00:52:19,640 --> 00:52:21,430
我想是"恰特"
I think it's "chat."

809
00:52:31,610 --> 00:52:33,740
你的表情是什麼意思
What is the purpose of your face?

810
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:39,270
我困惑了
I has confusion.

811
00:52:40,950 --> 00:52:43,500
我不想被消除
I do not wish to be erased.

812
00:52:44,330 --> 00:52:46,830
但是也許斯邁克船長是對的
But maybe Captain Smek is right.

813
00:52:47,330 --> 00:52:51,630
我很可能會繼續犯逗比錯誤
It is possible I will continue making hilarious mistakes.

814
00:52:52,170 --> 00:52:53,300
可能哦
Probably.

815
00:52:53,340 --> 00:52:55,470
這沒有讓我感到好受些
That is not making me feel better.

816
00:52:55,500 --> 00:52:57,290
人無完人
Nobody's perfect.

817
00:52:57,340 --> 00:53:01,810
我媽媽說 人只有犯過錯誤才能成長
My mom says your mistakes are what make you human.

818
00:53:01,840 --> 00:53:04,130
但並沒有說波波是犯過錯誤才能成長
That is not what makes you Boov.

819
00:53:07,310 --> 00:53:09,150
格拉托依蒂·圖琪...
Gratuity Tucci...

820
00:53:09,180 --> 00:53:11,310
在我們來地球前
before we came...

821
00:53:11,350 --> 00:53:15,060
斯邁克船長告訴我們人類需要我們
Captain Smek telled us that the humans needed us.

822
00:53:15,570 --> 00:53:18,530
人類就像動物...
That the humans were just like the animals...

823
00:53:18,570 --> 00:53:20,990
我們可以把人類馴化得更好...
and that we could to make them better...

824
00:53:21,030 --> 00:53:22,910
教化他們
teach to them.

825
00:53:22,950 --> 00:53:27,960
我們被告知人類很簡單 很落後
We were told the humans were simple and backwards.

826
00:53:29,710 --> 00:53:32,000
我們原來就是這麼想的
It is what we thought.

827
00:53:32,370 --> 00:53:33,540
但是我現在覺得...
But I am thinking now...

828
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:37,510
我們之前想錯了
that we were thinking wrong.

829
00:53:37,550 --> 00:53:40,600
斯邁克船長是錯得最離譜的
And that Captain Smek is the wrongest.

830
00:53:40,630 --> 00:53:45,130
我在想 波波一族從來就不應該來斯邁剋星球
I am thinking the Boov should never have come to Smekland.

831
00:53:45,180 --> 00:53:47,520
就是地球
To Earthland.

832
00:53:48,020 --> 00:53:52,070
所以 我向你道歉...
So I am saying the sorry to you...

833
00:53:52,100 --> 00:53:53,720
格拉托依蒂·圖琪
Gratuity Tucci.

834
00:54:02,740 --> 00:54:04,870
叫我小蒂
Call me Tip.

835
00:54:10,250 --> 00:54:14,300
這是一個全新的家 陌生的國家
It was a new home, a new country.

836
00:54:14,330 --> 00:54:16,160
我努力在學校裏交朋友...
I tried to make friends at school...

837
00:54:16,210 --> 00:54:20,180
但是我是從巴巴多斯來的書獃子
but I was this nerd from Barbados.

838
00:54:20,210 --> 00:54:23,380
但是你拿到了幾何學優等
But you dids to get an "A" in geometry.

839
00:54:23,430 --> 00:54:24,970
是的 我拿到了
Yeah, I did.

840
00:54:25,590 --> 00:54:28,550
我知道當其他波波說"哦哦"的時候...
I know when the other Boovs said "Oh"...

841
00:54:28,600 --> 00:54:31,150
他們不願意看到我
they were not happy to see me.

842
00:54:32,730 --> 00:54:35,820
事實上是 在波波中 我並不合群
The true is, among Boov, I do not fit in.

843
00:54:36,690 --> 00:54:38,150
我格格不入
I fit out.

844
00:54:41,070 --> 00:54:43,370
她特別了不起
She is so amazing.

845
00:54:43,400 --> 00:54:45,650
她把一切家當都存了起來
She saved up everything she had...

846
00:54:45,700 --> 00:54:48,660
所以我們就能搬家 搬家後也能生活得不錯
so we could move and things would be better for us.

847
00:54:48,990 --> 00:54:51,870
我等不及想見到邁瑪啦
I cannot wait to meet Mimom.

848
00:54:56,830 --> 00:54:59,790
"我是斯邁克船長 噓 噓 噓"
"My name is Captain Smek. Shush, shush, shush."

849
00:54:59,840 --> 00:55:02,840
"波波族的技術對於簡單的人類女孩來說
"Boov technology is far too complicated

850
00:55:02,840 --> 00:55:05,350
太複雜了 你是不可能破解的"
for simple humansgirl to figure out."

851
00:56:32,890 --> 00:56:34,100
他們是怎麼找到我們的
How did they find us?

852
00:56:34,140 --> 00:56:35,400
我不知道!
I do not know!

853
00:56:42,060 --> 00:56:44,230
等等 他們沒有攻擊我們
Wait. They're not attacking.

854
00:56:44,270 --> 00:56:46,310
因為他們在逃跑
Because they are running away.

855
00:56:47,490 --> 00:56:49,030
他們為什麼逃跑
Why are they running away?

856
00:56:49,070 --> 00:56:50,820
只可能有一個原因
There can only be one reason.

857
00:57:04,040 --> 00:57:04,910
格爾族
Gorg.

858
00:57:05,550 --> 00:57:08,390
這說不通 我阻止了那條信息
This makes no sense. I stopped the message.

859
00:57:09,340 --> 00:57:10,710
格爾族不可能找到我們
Gorg cannot to finding us.

860
00:57:11,430 --> 00:57:12,850
那為什麼他們找到了
Then how did they?

861
00:57:12,890 --> 00:57:15,100
肯定有其他原因
There must be some other reason!

862
00:57:19,520 --> 00:57:21,150
哦! 在我們後面!
Oh, behind us!

863
00:57:21,190 --> 00:57:23,070
啟動作戰系統
Engage weapons system.

864
00:57:23,110 --> 00:57:24,610
我們有作戰系統?
We have a weapons system?

865
00:57:29,400 --> 00:57:31,650
發射玉米煎餅魚雷
Go, Burrito Torpedo!

866
00:57:34,240 --> 00:57:34,900
命中!
Yes!

867
00:57:37,160 --> 00:57:40,030
我們被擊中了 我們的葡萄汁在流失
We've been hit! We're losing Grape Escape!

868
00:57:40,080 --> 00:57:41,620
橘子汁也在洩漏
We lost Tangerine Twist!

869
00:57:41,670 --> 00:57:44,880
如果我們沒有巴斯塔酸橙汁 我就不能操控了
If we lose Busta Lime, I cannot control!

870
00:57:44,920 --> 00:57:46,800
按按鈕出票 我們要墜車啦
Click and ticket. We are to crash!

871
00:57:46,840 --> 00:57:47,800
噢!
Oh!

872
00:58:05,650 --> 00:58:06,610
不 不 不
No, no, no.

873
00:58:06,980 --> 00:58:08,310
雪泥! 不要!
Slushious! No!

874
00:58:10,690 --> 00:58:12,270
不要光站那兒看著! 幫忙啊!
Don't just stand there! Help!

875
00:58:13,820 --> 00:58:15,610
拜託 拜託 拜託
Come on, come on, come on!

876
00:58:15,660 --> 00:58:18,000
雪泥! 不要!
Slushious! No!

877
00:58:25,290 --> 00:58:26,160
她壞掉了
She's gone.

878
00:58:26,210 --> 00:58:27,340
我們死定了
We are doomed.

879
00:58:27,380 --> 00:58:29,010
現在我再也去不了澳大利亞了
Now I'll never make it to Australia.

880
00:58:29,050 --> 00:58:31,180
我要開始唱波波滅亡曲了
I will now sing the Boov Death Song.

881
00:58:40,020 --> 00:58:41,190
格爾族戰船!
A Gorg ship!

882
00:58:41,230 --> 00:58:42,810
打斷滅亡曲是很粗魯的
It is rude to interrupt the Death Song.

883
00:58:42,850 --> 00:58:45,810
也許你可以從那艘船上取下部分來修我們的車
Maybe you could take the parts from it to fix our car.

884
00:58:46,060 --> 00:58:48,070
我不能夠 那些是格爾族的東西
I cannot. Those are Gorg parts.

885
00:58:48,070 --> 00:58:49,020
它們規格不一樣的
They are metric.

886
00:58:49,070 --> 00:58:51,700
我們不能夠功虧一簣
We're not getting this close and giving up.

887
00:58:51,740 --> 00:58:52,820
- 快點  - 不要!
- Come on. - No!

888
00:58:53,820 --> 00:58:55,030
跑得越遠越危險
Always with the running towards danger.

889
00:58:55,320 --> 00:58:56,940
別再做悲觀的懦夫波波了
Stop being such a Boov.

890
00:58:56,940 --> 00:58:58,570
這是我們唯一的機會 快點
It's our only chance. Come on.

891
00:59:01,660 --> 00:59:04,240
這是不會成功的!
This has low probability of success!

892
00:59:11,170 --> 00:59:12,710
- 走吧  - 等等
- Let's go. - Wait!

893
00:59:13,010 --> 00:59:14,050
等什麼
For what?

894
00:59:14,510 --> 00:59:16,180
等你改變心意
For you to change your mind.

895
00:59:16,510 --> 00:59:17,520
走吧
Come on.

896
00:59:34,070 --> 00:59:35,200
沒有飛行員
There's no pilot.

897
00:59:35,240 --> 00:59:36,870
這只是一艘無人駕駛飛船
It is just a drone.

898
00:59:40,450 --> 00:59:42,070
本來我們會完蛋的
That could have been badness.

899
00:59:42,120 --> 00:59:43,750
但是我們現在也不能掉以輕心
But we are not safety.

900
00:59:43,790 --> 00:59:46,210
格爾族的航母很快就會到這兒了
Gorg mothership will be here soon enough.

901
00:59:48,460 --> 00:59:49,880
有用的上的嗎
Can you use any of this?

902
00:59:49,920 --> 00:59:51,260
壞的
Broken.

903
00:59:51,300 --> 00:59:52,550
沒用
Useless.

904
00:59:52,590 --> 00:59:54,590
可能會導致熱核裂變
Likely to cause thermonuclear fission.

905
00:59:57,550 --> 00:59:58,920
這是什麼
What is it?

906
00:59:59,260 --> 01:00:00,380
這是格爾族的超級芯片
It is Gorg super-chip!

907
01:00:02,600 --> 01:00:04,560
它為什麼叫超級芯片
Why is it called a super-chip?

908
01:00:04,600 --> 01:00:05,900
它大部分是在市場上流通
It is mostly marketing.

909
01:00:05,930 --> 01:00:07,720
但它是使得格爾族
But it is key...

910
01:00:07,770 --> 01:00:11,570
擁有更強更好機器的關鍵物品
for the Gorg are having machines that are stronger and better at everything.

911
01:00:11,610 --> 01:00:13,740
因此我們永遠不能夠和格爾族平等對戰
So we can never fight them with equaltude.

912
01:00:13,780 --> 01:00:15,410
我們能用這個修飛船嗎
Can we use it to fix Slushious?

913
01:00:15,440 --> 01:00:17,860
可以的 飛船一定可以修好的
Yes, yes! The Slushious will fly again.

914
01:00:17,910 --> 01:00:18,950
太棒啦
Yes!

915
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:30,800
真是事半功倍啊
It was low probability of success.

916
01:00:30,830 --> 01:00:32,790
你真是個厲害的波波
Some Boov you are.

917
01:00:34,590 --> 01:00:35,640
快點
Quickly.

918
01:00:35,670 --> 01:00:37,710
我們得快點修好飛船找到邁瑪
We must fix the Slushious and find Mimom.

919
01:00:37,760 --> 01:00:38,930
是我媽啦
"My" mom.

920
01:00:38,970 --> 01:00:40,270
我不就是這個意思嗎
That is the thing I said.

921
01:00:40,300 --> 01:00:42,590
我就知道這能行的
I knew this would all work out!

922
01:00:45,970 --> 01:00:47,800
你太厲害啦
You were awesome!

923
01:00:47,850 --> 01:00:49,100
你一定能找到我媽的
We're gonna find my mom...

924
01:00:49,140 --> 01:00:52,100
你會成為一個大英雄並且給大家瞅瞅這塊超級芯片
you're gonna show everybody the super-chip and be a big hero

925
01:00:52,150 --> 01:00:54,530
甚至連斯邁克船長都要
and even Captain Smek will have to--

926
01:00:57,610 --> 01:00:59,650
好多人啊
That's a lot of people.

927
01:01:05,950 --> 01:01:07,280
- 再見了 波波 - 趕緊走吧
- Bye, Boov! - Get lost!

928
01:01:20,300 --> 01:01:23,840
天哪 你們的跑路技能點挺厲害的
Wow. You guys really are good at running away.

929
01:01:23,890 --> 01:01:24,890
是的
Yes.

930
01:01:25,680 --> 01:01:27,010
我們很擅長
Yes, we are.

931
01:01:35,520 --> 01:01:36,520
看那裏
Look, over there!

932
01:01:36,570 --> 01:01:38,200
我就是在那裏看到我媽媽的
That's where we saw my mom!

933
01:01:47,700 --> 01:01:49,240
快點 這是最後一艘船了
Hurry up, it is the last ship!

934
01:01:53,040 --> 01:01:55,370
沒事啦 豬豬 我會和媽媽一起回來的
It's okay, Pig. I'll be back with Mom.

935
01:01:59,260 --> 01:02:00,220
我們 快到了
We're almost there!

936
01:02:00,260 --> 01:02:01,220
這邊
Over here.

937
01:02:01,260 --> 01:02:02,350
- 什麼 - 快點
- What? - Hurry!

938
01:02:09,520 --> 01:02:12,110
我就不懂了 她在裏面嗎
I don't understand. She's in there?

939
01:02:14,730 --> 01:02:15,570
是的
Yes.

940
01:02:17,690 --> 01:02:18,900
趕緊把真相吐出來
Tell me the truth.

941
01:02:18,940 --> 01:02:20,400
沒時間了
There is no time.

942
01:02:20,440 --> 01:02:22,190
你可以跟我一起走
You can come with me.

943
01:02:22,240 --> 01:02:24,540
你會很安全的
You will be safety.

944
01:02:26,450 --> 01:02:29,370
我媽不在那艘船上 是不是
My mom's not on that ship, is she?

945
01:02:31,370 --> 01:02:34,410
你答應我幫我找她的 現在你卻要走了
You promised to help me find her, and you're leaving?

946
01:02:35,960 --> 01:02:37,920
- 你這個大騙子 - 不要啊
- You lied to me. - No!

947
01:02:37,960 --> 01:02:40,170
欺騙是件壞事
A lie is a bad thing.

948
01:02:40,210 --> 01:02:42,420
我干了壞事這樣你才能活下來
I did a thing so you can live.

949
01:02:42,470 --> 01:02:45,060
我媽在這 我不走
I'm not going. My mom is here.

950
01:02:45,090 --> 01:02:46,550
你永遠不會找到她的
You will never find her.

951
01:02:46,600 --> 01:02:48,100
百分百你找不到的
It is 100%.

952
01:02:48,140 --> 01:02:50,730
坐以待斃不會帶來任何希望的
Staying now does not make hope.

953
01:02:50,770 --> 01:02:52,810
格爾族的母艦快來了
Gorg mothership will be here soon.

954
01:02:53,770 --> 01:02:55,110
它會毀滅這個星球的
It destroys planets.

955
01:02:55,940 --> 01:02:58,030
- 我們現在必須跑路了 - 不
- We must run away now! - No!

956
01:02:58,070 --> 01:02:59,450
這是真的
It is true.

957
01:02:59,480 --> 01:03:03,060
人類竟然連這點小事都不能理解
Humanspersons cannot even understand simple, simple things.

958
01:03:03,110 --> 01:03:05,780
我在救你啊 我是你的夥伴
I am saving you! I am being your friend.

959
01:03:05,820 --> 01:03:08,400
不 你只是在逃跑
No, you're just running away.

960
01:03:08,450 --> 01:03:10,860
你離不開你的家族
You don't leave your family.

961
01:03:10,910 --> 01:03:12,240
你不能理解我
But you can't understand that

962
01:03:12,290 --> 01:03:14,460
因為你只是只波波
because you're just a Boov!

963
01:03:15,670 --> 01:03:18,510
你從來就沒跟我在一個陣營
You've never been my friend.

964
01:03:26,300 --> 01:03:27,380
等等
Wait!

965
01:03:27,430 --> 01:03:29,600
最後逃離口開始檢票
Final escape pod departing.

966
01:04:11,890 --> 01:04:15,190
我一直很討厭格爾族啊 他們總是能找到我們
I hate upon the Gorg! They are always finding us!

967
01:04:15,230 --> 01:04:16,650
格爾族的母艦
The Gorg mothership!

968
01:04:34,200 --> 01:04:35,120
我們完蛋了
We are doomed!

969
01:04:35,160 --> 01:04:36,160
快跑
Run away!

970
01:04:36,210 --> 01:04:37,880
讓我先走 我抱著孩子呢
Make a path, I'm holding a baby.

971
01:04:45,920 --> 01:04:47,960
他是那只逃跑的波波
It is the fugitive Boov!

972
01:04:48,010 --> 01:04:50,060
他怎麼反方向跑
He is running towards the danger!

973
01:04:50,390 --> 01:04:51,390
快阻止他
Stop him!

974
01:05:03,360 --> 01:05:04,570
不要啊
Undo!

975
01:05:23,590 --> 01:05:26,430
船長 我們達到了史上最快速
Captain, we are achieving new highest speeds!

976
01:05:27,710 --> 01:05:30,550
你都做了些啥喲 這是啥
What has you done? What is that thing?

977
01:05:31,090 --> 01:05:32,880
格爾族的超級芯片
It is Gorg super-chip.

978
01:05:33,390 --> 01:05:34,430
啥
What?

979
01:05:34,470 --> 01:05:35,760
格爾族無人機撞壞了
Gorg drone crashed

980
01:05:35,810 --> 01:05:38,230
我遇到了 結果就找到芯片
and I ran to it and I found the chip.

981
01:05:38,270 --> 01:05:39,060
夠了
Enough.

982
01:05:39,100 --> 01:05:40,930
你遇上過格爾族
You ran to a Gorg?

983
01:05:42,440 --> 01:05:44,400
他不懼險阻
He runs towards the danger?

984
01:05:44,440 --> 01:05:45,900
他是個怎樣的波波啊
What kind of Boov is he?

985
01:05:45,940 --> 01:05:49,020
超級波波
He is like a Super Boov.

986
01:05:49,070 --> 01:05:51,240
不不不
No, no, no.

987
01:05:51,280 --> 01:05:53,040
他才不是超級波波呢
He is not a Super Boov.

988
01:05:53,070 --> 01:05:55,590
在艦上只有一隻超級波波
There is only one Super Boov on this ship,

989
01:05:55,590 --> 01:05:57,030
你們都知道是誰
and you know who it is.

990
01:05:57,080 --> 01:05:58,580
近在眼前哦
You're looking at him.

991
01:05:58,620 --> 01:06:00,740
我組織的大逃亡
I invented running away.

992
01:06:00,790 --> 01:06:04,090
看看這個 我的噓噓棒
And look at this. I have the Shusher.

993
01:06:04,330 --> 01:06:06,580
我才是船長
I am your captain.

994
01:06:06,630 --> 01:06:08,260
但你不是個合格的船長
But you are not good captain.

995
01:06:08,300 --> 01:06:09,470
啥
What?

996
01:06:09,510 --> 01:06:12,850
你告訴我們的 我們都信了
You telled us these things, and we all believed them.

997
01:06:13,300 --> 01:06:14,800
起碼我信了
I believed them.

998
01:06:15,600 --> 01:06:18,480
但我遇到了個人類
But then I met a humansperson.

999
01:06:19,310 --> 01:06:21,480
她不像你所說的那樣
And she is not like you said.

1000
01:06:23,270 --> 01:06:26,070
她很勇敢 聰慧
She is brave and smart...

1001
01:06:26,110 --> 01:06:29,610
很關心其他人類
and cares about other humanspersons.

1002
01:06:29,650 --> 01:06:33,820
我們波波甚至不互相關心
In a way that we Boov do not even care about each other.

1003
01:06:35,870 --> 01:06:38,000
她甚至很關心我
She even cares about me.

1004
01:06:38,620 --> 01:06:41,170
雖然我幾乎啥也沒做
And I've done very little to earn that.

1005
01:06:42,160 --> 01:06:45,040
波波族雖然在很多方面很強
The Boov may be superior in many ways.

1006
01:06:45,330 --> 01:06:46,290
對
Yeah.

1007
01:06:46,340 --> 01:06:49,550
但不是在我現在認為重要的方面厲害
but not in the ways that I now thinks are most important.

1008
01:06:54,010 --> 01:06:55,350
哦 天
Big deal!

1009
01:06:55,390 --> 01:06:56,640
我聽夠了 閉嘴吧你
I have had enough. Shush!

1010
01:06:59,560 --> 01:07:02,860
你才真的是夠了
That is enough shushing.

1011
01:07:02,890 --> 01:07:04,850
你膽夠肥敢讓我閉嘴
How dare you shush a shushing!

1012
01:07:04,900 --> 01:07:07,690
哎呀是正確的我們需要一個新的船長
Oh is right. We need a new captain.

1013
01:07:08,150 --> 01:07:10,990
我覺得應該讓小歐來當
I thinks it should be Oh!

1014
01:07:11,530 --> 01:07:13,320
我 不
Me? No.

1015
01:07:13,360 --> 01:07:14,940
不 他才配不上船長之職
No! He cannot be captain.

1016
01:07:14,990 --> 01:07:17,370
我有噓噓棒 我是船長
I have the Shusher. I am captain!

1017
01:07:17,410 --> 01:07:18,250
再也不是了
Not anymore!

1018
01:07:20,540 --> 01:07:22,290
他不會知道怎麼控制這個的
He will not know how to operate it!

1019
01:07:22,330 --> 01:07:24,000
很複雜的
It is very complicated.

1020
01:07:24,040 --> 01:07:25,500
一頭中 一頭輕
Heavy on one end, light on the other.

1021
01:07:25,540 --> 01:07:26,540
安靜
Shush!

1022
01:07:27,540 --> 01:07:28,710
棒
Booyah!

1023
01:07:29,210 --> 01:07:31,830
不 我不適合領導波波
No, I am not a Leader Boov.

1024
01:07:31,880 --> 01:07:33,210
我做過太多錯事了
I makes far too many mistakes.

1025
01:07:33,670 --> 01:07:36,500
你不是唯一一個犯錯誤的波波
You are not the only Boov who makes mistakes.

1026
01:07:37,220 --> 01:07:38,810
比如
For examples

1027
01:07:38,850 --> 01:07:42,400
我的過失是沒當你的好夥伴
my mistake is not being your friend.

1028
01:07:49,440 --> 01:07:51,570
小歐船長萬歲
All hail Captain Oh!

1029
01:07:54,240 --> 01:07:55,490
我看到是你幹的了
I saw who did that!

1030
01:07:55,530 --> 01:07:57,080
我有仇必報 你看著辦吧
I hold grudges, you know!

1031
01:08:05,210 --> 01:08:06,540
小歐 你是最棒的
Oh, you're the best!

1032
01:08:07,080 --> 01:08:09,200
想讓我辦個派對嗎 小歐
Want me to host party, Oh?

1033
01:09:46,770 --> 01:09:48,610
走開
Go away.

1034
01:09:49,020 --> 01:09:52,570
才不呢 你應該說 是誰呀
No, you are supposed to be saying "Who is there?"

1035
01:09:52,600 --> 01:09:54,060
我就能說
Then I am to be saying

1036
01:09:54,110 --> 01:09:55,450
哞
"Moo!"

1037
01:09:55,480 --> 01:09:56,350
小歐
Oh!

1038
01:09:58,530 --> 01:10:00,830
我簡直不敢相信
I can't believe it!

1039
01:10:01,280 --> 01:10:03,040
但我看著你們的船離開的呀
But I saw your ship leave!

1040
01:10:05,870 --> 01:10:09,170
你回來了 你還回來幹啥
But you came back! What are you doing here?

1041
01:10:09,200 --> 01:10:10,830
這裏是我心之所屬
It is where I belongs.

1042
01:10:10,870 --> 01:10:13,660
你和豬豬是我的朋友
You and Pigcat are my friends.

1043
01:10:14,500 --> 01:10:16,120
並且
And alsos, too

1044
01:10:16,170 --> 01:10:18,050
我給過你承諾
I gave you a promise.

1045
01:11:40,090 --> 01:11:41,300
他是我朋友
He's my friend.

1046

謝謝你
Thank you.

1047
01:11:49,720 --> 01:11:50,880
媽媽
Mom.

1048
01:11:54,940 --> 01:11:56,610
小蒂蒂 你真是我的寶貝
Tippy. My beautiful girl.

1049
01:11:56,650 --> 01:11:59,440
媽媽 我每個地方都找遍了
I've been looking everywhere, Mom.

1050
01:11:59,480 --> 01:12:02,230
我超怕 我再也見不到你了
I was so scared we'd never see each other again.

1051
01:12:02,280 --> 01:12:05,410
媽媽 我不會放棄找你的
Mom, I never would have stopped looking until I found you.

1052
01:12:09,580 --> 01:12:11,500
他們仍然在找
They are still looking.

1053
01:12:28,140 --> 01:12:30,020
格爾族不是侵略者
Gorg are not the takers.

1054
01:12:30,850 --> 01:12:32,350
波波族才是
Boov are.

1055
01:12:36,730 --> 01:12:39,360
我們必須證明我們的猜測
We must demonstrate our affections later.

1056
01:12:39,400 --> 01:12:41,360
但現在還有個問題
There is still one problem.

1057
01:12:41,400 --> 01:12:43,320
不好意思 那是什麼
Excuse me, what is that?

1058
01:12:43,360 --> 01:12:44,520
格爾族的母艦
That is Gorg mothership.

1059
01:12:44,530 --> 01:12:46,200
它是來毀滅這個星球的
It is here to destroy the planet.

1060
01:12:51,450 --> 01:12:52,870
它要毀滅這個星球

小蒂現在不准出來

1066
01:13:19,940 --> 01:13:21,900
我要彌補自己犯下的錯
I am fixing my mistake.

1067
01:13:22,400 --> 01:13:25,740
小歐 你一個人做不到的
Oh! You can't do this on your own!

1068
01:13:25,780 --> 01:13:27,620
也許做不到
Maybe not.

1069
01:13:27,650 --> 01:13:29,690
但我心存希望
But I haves hope.

停下 別去
Stop, no!

1072
01:13:36,080 --> 01:13:37,580
別一個人干啊
Please don't do this by yourself!

1073
01:13:43,790 --> 01:13:44,830
別啊 不要去
No! Don't!

1074
01:13:45,960 --> 01:13:47,250
Oh!

1075
01:14:06,650 --> 01:14:09,160
快停下
Stop!

1076
01:14:12,700 --> 01:14:14,450

1078
01:14:29,340 --> 01:14:31,050
格爾
Gorg!

1079
01:14:31,380 --> 01:14:34,010
大叫根本沒用
It is useless to yell.

1080
01:14:34,050 --> 01:14:35,380
格爾
Gorg!

1081
01:14:44,730 --> 01:14:46,280
他們看不見他
They're not gonna see him.

1082
01:14:46,320 --> 01:14:47,490
這樣沒用
It's not gonna work!

1083
01:14:48,360 --> 01:14:49,530
聖誕快樂
Merry Christmas.

讓駕駛者分心
Distracting the driver.

1088
01:15:34,280 --> 01:15:36,490
奏效了 母艦停下了
It worked! The ship's stopping!

1089

你把我嚇壞了
But you scared me so bad!

1103
01:18:03,180 --> 01:18:04,810
你嚇壞了
You were scared?

1104
01:18:04,850 --> 01:18:07,060
我至少還是第三名
I almost made a number three.

1105
01:18:07,100 --> 01:18:08,150
不算太難
Not too hard!

1106
01:18:08,180 --> 01:18:10,680
還是有點可能性的
It is still a possibility.

1107
01:20:20,020 --> 01:20:22,270
那是在說什麼呀
What was all that?

1108
01:20:22,320 --> 01:20:26,080
不是所有的格爾語都能對應成人類語言
Not all Gorg-speak has humans words.

1109
01:20:26,110 --> 01:20:30,780
可事實上 他們並不是我邀請來的
But, it turns out, Gorg was not here because of my invitation...

1110
01:20:30,830 --> 01:20:33,120
雖然他們很樂意接受邀請
though Gorg would have been happy to attend.

1111
01:20:34,160 --> 01:20:38,450
他們在這兒是因為 他們正追蹤這塊石頭
Gorg was here because Gorg was tracking the rock.

1112
01:20:38,500 --> 01:20:40,120
這裏面有什麼
What was in that thing?

1113
01:20:40,170 --> 01:20:41,300
格爾族系
Gorg family.

1114
01:20:41,880 --> 01:20:44,720
他們的整個新生代
It is entire next generation.

1115
01:20:45,010 --> 01:20:46,350
整個嗎
All of them?

1116
01:20:46,880 --> 01:20:48,340
整個
All of them.

1117
01:20:58,810 --> 01:21:00,980
難怪他們一直追著你們
No wonder they've been chasing you.

1118
01:21:01,690 --> 01:21:04,310
不是他們 是他
Not "they," "he."

1119
01:21:04,360 --> 01:21:08,330
顯然 那個格爾人是最後一個格爾族人了
Apparently, that Gorg is last Gorg.

1120
01:21:08,360 --> 01:21:10,490
這就是為什麼這塊石頭那麼重要
That is why rock was so important.

1121
01:21:10,530 --> 01:21:12,650
沒有它 他就會孤獨一人
Without it, he was alonely...

1122
01:21:12,700 --> 01:21:15,240
然後獨自滅絕
and would someday be extinctly...

1123
01:21:15,290 --> 01:21:18,460
格爾一族也將煙消雲散
which made Gorg cranky and irrational...

1124
01:21:18,500 --> 01:21:20,840
永遠湮滅在宇宙中
and physically violent.

1125
01:21:20,880 --> 01:21:22,840
他就像個人類女孩
He was just like humansgirl.

1126
01:21:24,300 --> 01:21:27,890
他傷心的快發瘋了
He was sad-mad.

1127
01:21:35,890 --> 01:21:37,050
謝謝你
Thanking you.

1128
01:21:37,560 --> 01:21:40,030
謝謝你 漂亮擊掌
Thanking you! High hand touching.

1129
01:21:40,060 --> 01:21:41,850
哈哈 來吧 二連擊
Yeah, give it here. High hand touching.

1130
01:21:41,900 --> 01:21:44,240
再高點 你太慢啦
Up high! You are too slow.

1131
01:21:45,400 --> 01:21:48,020
漂亮擊掌 這下好疼
High hand touching! That hurt.

1132
01:22:13,600 --> 01:22:14,600
豬豬貓
Pigcat!

1133
01:22:16,270 --> 01:22:17,270
嗨 小歐
Hey, Oh!

1134
01:22:19,180 --> 01:22:20,560
你好啊 好友凱爾
Hello, friend Kyle.

1135
01:22:20,600 --> 01:22:22,640
我也有一樣的顏色
I have that same color.

1136
01:22:22,690 --> 01:22:24,690
- 嗨 邁媽  - 嗨 小歐
- Hi, Mimom. - Hi, Oh.

1137
01:22:24,730 --> 01:22:26,140
派對太贊啦
Awesome party, Oh!

1138
01:22:26,190 --> 01:22:29,020
有人參加的排隊實在是太帶感啦
Parties are so much more fun when other people show up.

1139
01:22:29,700 --> 01:22:31,490
是時候再進一步了吧
Is it time to pick it up a level?

1140
01:22:31,530 --> 01:22:32,120
對
Yes!

1141
01:22:33,450 --> 01:22:35,210
這下要變得更帶勁啦
This is gonna be sweet!

1142
01:22:35,240 --> 01:22:37,240
一起來手舞足蹈吧
Drop it like it has a high temperature!

1143
01:22:52,300 --> 01:22:53,460
哎呀 不好
Oh, no!

1144
01:22:56,640 --> 01:22:58,480
控制不住我的身體啦
What is happening to my body?

1145
01:23:03,810 --> 01:23:05,810
波波們搖擺起來
Shake your Boov thang!

1146
01:23:06,400 --> 01:23:09,320
把你的雙手舉在空中 舞步跳的很輕鬆
My hands are in the air like I just do not care!

1147
01:23:13,490 --> 01:23:18,460
我有了新家 新夥伴 新的開端
I has a new start in a new home with new friends.

1148
01:23:18,490 --> 01:23:22,620
現在 每一天都是最棒的一天
And now, every day is best day ever!

1149
01:23:43,850 --> 01:23:46,560
