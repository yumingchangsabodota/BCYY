00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:19,880
首先應該說明你的門卡

非常簡單

If you try a door and it stays shut, okay, it's off-limits.

00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:19,600
沒什麼不對勁

我在想 "這真酷"
I was thinking, "This is really cool."

00:08:35,090 --> 00:08:38,720
凱勒博 這房間沒有窗戶是有原因的
Caleb, there's a reason there are no windows in this room.

92
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:40,150

I'm Caleb.

141
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:10,030
你好 凱勒博
Hello, Caleb.

142
00:13:12,630 --> 00:13:14,150
你有名字嗎
Do you have a name?

143
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,060
有
Yes.

144
00:13:17,370 --> 00:13:18,430
艾娃
Ava.

145
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:21,970
我很高興認識你 艾娃
I'm pleased to meet you, Ava.

146
00:13:22,710 --> 00:13:24,900
我也很高興認識你
I'm pleased to meet you, too.

147
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:29,080
我以前從沒見過別人
I've never met anyone new before.

148
00:13:29,810 --> 00:13:31,210
只有納森
Only Nathan.

149
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:35,850
那麼我們倆的情況有點類似
Then I guess we're both in quite a similar position.

150
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:38,390
你以前沒見過別人嗎
Haven't you met lots of new people before?

151
00:13:39,390 --> 00:13:40,880
沒有跟你一樣的人
None like you.

152
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:47,290
所以我們得破冰一下
So we need to break the ice.

153
00:13:48,230 --> 00:13:50,360
- 懂我的意思嗎 -懂
Do you know what I mean by that? Yes.

154
00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:51,700
什麼意思
What do I mean?

155
00:13:51,770 --> 00:13:54,290
化解最初的社交尷尬
Overcome initial social awkwardness.

156
00:13:54,910 --> 00:13:56,340
所以我們聊聊吧
So let's have a conversation.

157
00:13:57,340 --> 00:13:58,470
好的
Okay.

158
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:02,940
你想聊什麼
What would you like to have a conversation about?

159
00:14:03,010 --> 00:14:05,570
不如你先自我介紹吧
Why don't we start with you telling me something about yourself?

160
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:08,210
你想知道什麼
What would you like to know?

161
00:14:08,450 --> 00:14:10,180
你想到什麼就說
Whatever comes into your head.

162
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:13,520
你已經知道我的名字了
Well, you already know my name.

163
00:14:14,730 --> 00:14:17,020
也看得出來我是機械人
And you can see that I'm a machine.

164
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:19,730
- 想知道我幾歲嗎 -當然
Would you like to know how old I am? Sure.

165
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:21,090
我是一
I'm one.

166
00:14:21,430 --> 00:14:22,690
- 什麼
One what?

167
00:14:23,570 --> 00:14:25,590
- 一年還是一天 -一
One year or one day? One.

168
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:31,710
你何時學會說話 艾娃
When did you learn how to speak, Ava?

169
00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:35,070
我一直都知道怎麼說話
I always knew how to speak,

170
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:37,980
那很怪吧
and that's strange, isn't it?

171
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:39,540
為什麼
Why?

172
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:43,180
因為語言是學來的
Becauselanguage is something that people acquire.

173
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:47,790
有些人相信語言是與生俱來的
Well, some people believe language exists from birth.

174
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:50,560
只是學習運用這潛能的
And what is learned is the ability to attach words

175
00:14:50,630 --> 00:14:53,030
句子和結構 你同意嗎
and structure to the latent ability. Do you agree with that?

176
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:54,960
我不知道
I don't know.

177
00:14:56,670 --> 00:14:59,160
你明天還會來嗎 凱勒博
Will you come back tomorrow, Caleb?

178
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:01,260
會的
Yes.

179
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:06,900
很好
Good.

180
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:16,910
老天 她好迷人
Oh, man, she's fascinating.

181
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:20,580
跟她說話時 就像是...
When you talk to her, you're just...

182
00:15:20,830 --> 00:15:22,290
鏡中奇緣
Through the looking glass.

183
00:15:22,890 --> 00:15:25,290
"鏡中奇緣" 天啊
"Through the looking glass." Wow.

184
00:15:25,630 --> 00:15:27,530
你真會說話 凱勒博 引用名言佳句
You're good with words, Caleb. You're quotable.

185
00:15:27,630 --> 00:15:28,860
其實那是別人引用的
Actually, that's someone else's quote.

186
00:15:28,930 --> 00:15:31,830
我寫下了 你構思出來的另一句話
You know, I wrote down that other line you came up with.

187
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:33,030
關於
The one about how

188
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:34,940
我發明了有意識的機械人
if I've invented a machine with consciousness,

189
00:15:35,010 --> 00:15:36,500
我不是人 我是神
I'm not a man, I'm God.

190
00:15:36,570 --> 00:15:37,840
我想那不是...
I don't think that's exactly what I...

191
00:15:37,910 --> 00:15:40,070
我只是覺得"老天 那太棒了"
I just thought, "Fuck, man, that is so good."

192
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:42,610
等這故事公諸于世時
When we get to tell the story. You know?

193
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:44,380
我轉頭看凱勒博
I turned to Caleb,

194
00:15:44,650 --> 00:15:47,080
他抬頭看著我說
and he looked up at me and he said,

195
00:15:47,150 --> 00:15:48,450
"你不是人 你是神"
"You're not a man, you're God."

196
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:49,920
對 但我沒那麼說
Yeah, but I didn't say that.

197
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:51,710
所以...
So...

198
00:15:51,790 --> 00:15:53,020
總之
anyway-

199
00:15:55,930 --> 00:15:56,920
她讓你驚歎
You're impressed.

200
00:15:57,660 --> 00:15:59,190
對 對
Yes. Yes.

201
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,860
- 雖然...-雖然
Although... Although?

202
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,600
你驚歎還有條件
There's a qualification to you being impressed?

203
00:16:04,670 --> 00:16:07,190
沒有 對她沒有任何條件
No, there's no qualification to her.

204
00:16:07,710 --> 00:16:09,900
只是圖靈測試
Uh, it's just in the Turing Test,

205
00:16:10,210 --> 00:16:12,140
機械人不該被測試員看到
the machine should be hidden from the examiner.

206
00:16:12,210 --> 00:16:13,800
不 我們遠遠超過那點
No, no, no, we're way past that.

207
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:16,410
若不讓你看到艾娃 只聽到聲音
If I hid Ava from you, so you just heard her voice,

208
00:16:16,410 --> 00:16:17,610
她會通過人類測試
she would pass for human.

209
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:20,580
真正的測試是讓你看到她是機械人
The real test is to show you that she's a robot

210
00:16:20,650 --> 00:16:23,450
然後看你是否仍覺得她有意識
and then see if you still feel she has consciousness.

211
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:27,050
對 你可能是對的
Yeah, I think you're probably right.

212
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:32,460
她的語言能力很不可思議
Her language abilities, they're incredible.

213
00:16:32,530 --> 00:16:36,490
系統是隨機的 對吧
The system is stochastic. Right?

214
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:39,400
非決定性的
It's non-deterministic.

215
00:16:39,470 --> 00:16:40,630
剛開始我認為
At first I thought she was mapping

216
00:16:40,710 --> 00:16:43,500
她把內在語義編排成樹狀句法
from internal semantic form to syntactic tree-structure

217
00:16:43,570 --> 00:16:44,800
然後得到線性句子
and then getting linearized words.

218
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:47,670
但後來我漸漸明白 這是混合的模式
But then I started to realize the model was some kind of hybrid.

219
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:48,940
凱勒博
Caleb.

220
00:16:49,610 --> 00:16:50,600
不是嗎
No?

221
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:54,080
我明白你希望我解釋艾娃的運作
I understand that you want me to explain how Ava works.

222
00:16:54,150 --> 00:16:56,310
但很抱歉 我沒辦法那麼做
But I'm sorry, I'm not gonna be able to do that.

223
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:59,120
說來聽聽 我對高階的抽象概念很拿手
Try me. I'm hot on high-level abstraction.

224
00:16:59,190 --> 00:17:01,990
不是因為我認為你太愚昧
It's not because I think you're too dumb.

225
00:17:02,190 --> 00:17:04,400
而是因為我想和你喝啤酒聊天
It's because I want to have a beer and a conversation with you.

226
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:05,290
不是開研討會
Not a seminar.

227
00:17:06,330 --> 00:17:07,800
對 抱歉
Yeah. Sorry.

228
00:17:08,230 --> 00:17:10,600
不 沒關係 你很好
No, it's okay. You're all right.

229
00:17:10,670 --> 00:17:11,900
"只是...
Just"

230
00:17:14,070 --> 00:17:15,600
回答我這個問題
Answer me this.

231
00:17:16,340 --> 00:17:18,370
你對她有何感覺
How do you feel about her?

232
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:21,170
不是邏輯上的
Nothing analytical.

233
00:17:21,550 --> 00:17:23,780
而是你的感覺
Just how do you feel?

234
00:17:24,620 --> 00:17:25,780
我覺得
I feel

235
00:17:28,490 --> 00:17:30,580
她真的很神奇
that she's fucking amazing.

236
00:17:31,990 --> 00:17:33,080
老弟
Dude.

237
00:17:34,090 --> 00:17:35,080
乾杯
Cheers.

238
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:38,090
乾杯
Cheers.

239
00:18:15,870 --> 00:18:17,090
真是的
Damn it.

240
00:18:43,190 --> 00:18:44,820
搞什麼
What the fuck?

241
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:37,010
斷電 啟動備用電源
Power cut. Backup power activated.

242
00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:51,390
封鎖所有設備 直到主電源恢復供電
Full facility lock-down until main generator is restored.

243
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:53,120
不會吧
You're kidding me.

244
00:19:57,070 --> 00:20:00,830
封鎖所有設備 直到主電源恢復供電
Full facility lock-down until main generator is restored.

245
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:08,100
恢復供電
Power restored.

246
00:21:20,150 --> 00:21:21,140
有人嗎
Hello?

247
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:43,800
請插入門卡
Please insert keycard.

248
00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:50,910
你沒有許可權使用電話
You don't have access to use the phone.

249
00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:52,800
嘿
Hey.

250
00:21:54,350 --> 00:21:57,680
抱歉 但你要理解 你知道艾娃這案子
Sorry, but you understand, though, given Ava,

251
00:21:58,490 --> 00:22:00,920
而你算是個未知人物
and you being kind of an unknown.

252
00:22:01,990 --> 00:22:03,720
我是說 一個好人
I mean, a great guy.

253
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:06,990
一拍即合的好夥伴
Instant pals, and so on.

254
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:14,340
你要打給誰
Who are you gonna call?

255
00:22:15,770 --> 00:22:17,400
不知道 沒有人吧
Oh. I don't know. No one, really.

256
00:22:17,470 --> 00:22:18,700
- 魔鬼剋星 -什麼
Ghostbusters. What?

257
00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:21,840
你要打給誰 魔鬼剋星 那是...
Who are you gonna call? Ghostbusters. It's a...

258
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:25,240
那是一部電影
It's a movie, man.

259
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:29,080
你不知道那部電影
You don't know that movie?

260
00:22:30,590 --> 00:22:33,080
鬼幫丹艾克洛德做性服務
A ghost gives Dan Aykroyd oral sex.

261
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:38,190
我只是好奇怎麼使用電話
I was just wondering how the phone worked.

262
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:40,350
如此而已
That's all.

263
00:22:41,030 --> 00:22:45,200
你這時候醒來做什麼 來加入派對嗎
So what are you doing awake at this time? You come to join the party?

264
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:47,700
我的房間出了點狀況
Uh, something happened in my room.

265
00:22:48,210 --> 00:22:50,110
好像斷電了
Some kind of power cut.

266
00:22:50,610 --> 00:22:52,270
所以我來看怎麼回事
So I came to see what's going on.

267
00:22:52,340 --> 00:22:53,970
斷電 對
The power cuts, yeah.

268
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:56,480
最近常常斷電
We've been getting those recently. Um...

269
00:22:59,180 --> 00:23:00,840
我在想辦法解決
I'm working on it.

270
00:23:01,690 --> 00:23:03,650
我沒辦法打開我的房門
I couldn't open the door to my bedroom.

271
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:05,150
那是安全措施
That's a security measure.

272
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:08,090
自動封鎖 不然的話
Automatic lock-down. Otherwise,

273
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:11,460
任何人都能利用切斷電源 闖進屋裡
anybody could just open the place up by disabling the juice.

274
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:16,760
若再發生 別緊張 好嗎
If it happens again, relax. Okay?

275
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:19,530
當然
Sure.

276
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:22,370
祝你有個美夢
Sweet dreams.

277
00:24:23,330 --> 00:24:24,390
嘿
Hey.

278
00:24:24,570 --> 00:24:25,690
- 嘿 -早安
Hey, man. Good morning.

279
00:24:25,770 --> 00:24:29,140
早安 抱歉 我得派京子把你吵醒
Good morning. Sorry I had to send Kyoko to wake you,

280
00:24:29,210 --> 00:24:30,830
我只是不想虛度今日
but I didn't want too much of the day to slip by.

281
00:24:30,910 --> 00:24:33,210
對 我瞭解 這是好事 謝謝
Yeah, I know. It was a good thing. Thanks.

282
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:35,300
她很迷人吧
She's some alarm clock, huh?

283
00:24:35,380 --> 00:24:37,610
讓你一早就很亢奮
Gets you right up in the morning.

284
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:40,110
第二天 準備好了嗎
So Day 2. You ready?

285
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:41,770
有何計畫 說來聽聽
What's the plan? Hit me.

286
00:24:41,850 --> 00:24:43,840
對 我不確定
Yeah, well, I'm not sure.

287
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:47,590
我還在思考測試形式
I'm still trying to, uh, figure the examination formats. Uh-huh.

288
00:24:48,730 --> 00:24:50,450
對 我覺得
Yeah, it feels like

289
00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:54,390
透過對話測試艾娃是個死胡同
testing Ava through conversation is kind of a closed loop.

290
00:24:54,630 --> 00:24:56,360
- 死胡同 -對
It's a closed loop? Yeah.

291
00:24:56,430 --> 00:25:00,270
就像只用下棋來測試電腦西洋棋
Like testing a chess computer by only playing chess.

292
00:25:00,770 --> 00:25:03,400
不然你怎麼測試電腦西洋棋
How else do you test a chess computer?

293
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:05,540
看情況
Well, it depends.

294
00:25:05,610 --> 00:25:09,210
你可以跟它下棋 看它是否下對棋
You know, I mean, you can play it to find out if it makes good moves,

295
00:25:09,210 --> 00:25:10,210
但是...
but, uh...

296
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:15,080
但是那樣無法測出 它是否知道這是在下棋
But that won't tell you if it knows that it's playing chess.

297
00:25:15,290 --> 00:25:18,120
也無法測出 它是否知道什麼是下棋
And it won't tell you if it knows what chess is.

298
00:25:18,460 --> 00:25:20,480
因此這是區分模擬和真實
Uh-huh. So it's simulation versus actual.

299
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:21,920
對 對
Yes. Yeah.

300
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:25,160
我認為把這兩者區分出來
And I think being able to differentiate between those two

301
00:25:25,260 --> 00:25:27,160
才是你要我執行的圖靈測試
is the Turing Test you want me to perform.

302
00:25:27,230 --> 00:25:29,790
幫我個忙 別管教科書上的方法
Look, do me a favor. Lay off the textbook approach.

303
00:25:29,870 --> 00:25:32,500
我只想得到簡單問題的簡單答案
I just want simple answers to simple questions.

304
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:36,340
昨天我問你對她的感覺 你給了我好答案
Yesterday I asked you how you felt about her and you gave me a great answer.

305
00:25:37,110 --> 00:25:38,870
現在問題是
Now the question is,

306
00:25:40,110 --> 00:25:42,240
她對你有何感覺
how does she feel about you?

307
00:25:44,850 --> 00:25:47,650
艾娃 第二期

308
00:25:48,850 --> 00:25:50,510
你覺得如何
What do you think?

309
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:56,150
你在畫什麼
What is it a drawing of?

310
00:25:57,130 --> 00:25:58,650
你不知道嗎
Don't you know?

311
00:25:58,860 --> 00:26:01,330
- 不知道 -還以為你會告訴我
No. I thought you would tell me.

312
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:04,220
你不知道嗎
Don't you know?

313
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:08,630
我每天畫畫
I do drawings every day.

314
00:26:09,340 --> 00:26:11,740
但我從不知道那是什麼
But I never know what they're of.

315
00:26:12,540 --> 00:26:15,640
你不試著畫具體一點的東西嗎
Are you not trying to sketch something specific?

316
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:18,540
例如一個物體或人
Like an object or a person?

317
00:26:22,420 --> 00:26:24,180
也許你能試試
Maybe you could try.

318
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:27,550
好吧
Okay.

319
00:26:29,630 --> 00:26:31,650
我該畫什麼物體
What object should I draw?

320
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:34,990
隨你 由你決定
Whatever you want. It's your decision.

321
00:26:35,070 --> 00:26:36,830
為什麼由我決定
Why is it my decision?

322
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:39,700
我很想看你會選擇什麼
I'm interested to see what you'll choose.

323
00:27:01,490 --> 00:27:03,120
你想當我的朋友嗎
Do you want to be my friend?

324
00:27:04,830 --> 00:27:05,820
當然
Of course.

325
00:27:05,930 --> 00:27:07,730
有可能嗎
Will it be possible?

326
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:09,260
為何不可能
Why would it not be?

327
00:27:09,830 --> 00:27:12,170
我們的談話是單向的
Our conversations are one-sided.

328
00:27:12,570 --> 00:27:15,940
你謹慎地提問並研究我的反應
You ask circumspect questions and study my responses.

329
00:27:17,670 --> 00:27:18,660
對
Yes.

330
00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:20,400
你瞭解我
You learn about me

331
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:22,840
我卻一點也不瞭解你
and I learn nothing about you.

332
00:27:23,410 --> 00:27:26,110
那不是友誼的基礎
That's not a foundation on which friendships are based.

333
00:27:27,250 --> 00:27:29,580
所以呢 你要我談談自己
So what? You want me to talk about myself?

334
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:32,180
對
Yes.

335
00:27:33,190 --> 00:27:34,450
這個嘛...
Where...

336
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:37,060
好吧 我該從何說起
Okay, where do I start?

337
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:40,190
由你決定
It's your decision.

338
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,490
我很想看你會選擇什麼
I'm interested to see what you'll choose.

339
00:27:45,970 --> 00:27:48,030
好吧 艾娃
Okay, Ava.

340
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:51,300
這個嘛
Well,

341
00:27:52,410 --> 00:27:53,670
你知道我的名字
you know my name.

342
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:56,040
- 知道 -我26歲
Yes. I'm 26.

343
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:58,970
我在納森的公司上班
I work at Nathan's company.

344
00:27:59,620 --> 00:28:01,480
你知道他的公司嗎
Do you know what his company is?

345

346
00:28:03,990 --> 00:28:06,110
以維根斯坦的筆記命名
Named after Wittgenstein's notes.

347
00:28:06,190 --> 00:28:09,020
這公司是世上最受歡迎的 網路搜尋引擎
It's the world's most popular internet search engine,

348
00:28:09,090 --> 00:28:13,360
平均處理全球百分之94的 網路搜尋需求
processing an average of 94% of all internet search requests.

349
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:16,530
完全正確
That's exactly right.

350
00:28:17,930 --> 00:28:20,100
你住哪 凱勒博
Where do you live, Caleb?

351
00:28:21,510 --> 00:28:23,470
長島的布魯克黑文
Brookhaven, Long Island.

352
00:28:26,910 --> 00:28:28,540
那裡好嗎
Is it nice there?

353
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:30,310
還好
It's okay.

354
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:33,610
我住在公寓裡 有點小
I got an apartment. It's kind of small.

355
00:28:34,250 --> 00:28:35,680
非常小
It's very small.

356
00:28:35,750 --> 00:28:38,550
不過到公司只要走五分鐘
But, uh, it's a five-minute walk to the office

357
00:28:38,620 --> 00:28:41,220
到海邊也只要走五分鐘
and a five-minute walk to the ocean,

358
00:28:41,290 --> 00:28:42,760
我喜歡那樣
which I like.

359
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:44,780
你結婚了嗎
Are you married?

360
00:28:48,070 --> 00:28:49,190
沒有
No.

361
00:28:49,270 --> 00:28:52,100
你是單身嗎
Is your status single?

362
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:55,500
對
Yes.

363
00:28:56,110 --> 00:28:58,010
你的家人呢
What about your family?

364
00:28:59,010 --> 00:29:01,240
我在奧勒崗州波特蘭長大
I grew up in Portland, Oregon.

365
00:29:02,150 --> 00:29:03,640
沒有兄弟姊妹
No brothers or sisters.

366
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:07,110
我父母都是高中老師
My parents were both high school teachers.

367
00:29:08,290 --> 00:29:09,790
如果我們倆再熟一點
And if we're getting to know each other,

368
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:11,720
我大概會告訴你 他們倆死了
I guess I should tell you they're both dead.

369
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:15,430
在我15歲時車禍身亡
Car crash when I was 15.

370
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:18,530
事實上 我也在車裡
In fact, I was in the car with them.

371
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:19,960
後座
Back seat.

372
00:29:20,630 --> 00:29:23,690
前座情況最嚴重
But it was the front that got the worst of it.

373
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:26,700
我很遺憾
I'm sorry.

374
00:29:27,070 --> 00:29:28,500
沒關係的
It's all right.

375
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:32,300
後來我在醫院躺了很久
I spent a long time in the hospital afterward.

376
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:34,370
將近一年
Like nearly a year.

377
00:29:34,610 --> 00:29:36,480
然後我喜歡上編寫程式
And I got into coding.

378
00:29:37,150 --> 00:29:40,710
等我上大學時 我就很高竿了
And by the time I got to college, I was pretty advanced.

379
00:29:42,190 --> 00:29:44,310
一名高竿的程式設計師
An advanced programmer.

380
00:29:45,090 --> 00:29:46,150
是的
Yes.

381
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:48,750
就像納森
Like Nathan.

382
00:29:48,830 --> 00:29:49,920
對
Yes.

383
00:29:50,530 --> 00:29:51,550
不對
No.

384
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:54,390
不一樣
It's different.

385
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:57,830
納森13歲時 就編寫了藍皮書的基礎碼
Nathan wrote the Blue Book base code when he was 13.

386
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:02,300
如果你瞭解編碼 他的成就形同莫劄特
Which, if you understand code, what he did was like Mozart or something.

387
00:30:02,370 --> 00:30:04,070
你喜歡莫劄特嗎
Do you like Mozart?

388
00:30:04,140 --> 00:30:05,340
我喜歡流行尖端樂團
I like Depeche Mode.

389
00:30:05,410 --> 00:30:06,710
你喜歡納森嗎
Do you like Nathan?

390
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:11,870
當然喜歡
Yes, of course.

391
00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:14,140
- 納森是你的朋友嗎 -我的朋友
Is Nathan your friend? My friend?

392
00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:15,550
我...對 我希望
I... Yeah, I hope so.

393
00:30:15,620 --> 00:30:17,110
好朋友
A good friend?

394
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:19,110
對
Um, yeah.

395
00:30:19,190 --> 00:30:20,850
不 不是好朋友
VVeH, no, no, no, I mean, not a good friend.

396
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:22,650
好朋友是...
A good friend is, uh...

397
00:30:23,190 --> 00:30:25,820
我們才剛認識
We only just met each other, you know.

398
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,590
因此需要時間才能...
So it takes time to be able to, um...

399
00:30:29,370 --> 00:30:31,530
互相瞭解吧
To get to know each other, I guess.

400
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:34,300
斷電 啟動備用電源
Power cut. Backup power activated.

401
00:30:54,660 --> 00:30:55,780
凱勒博
Caleb.

402
00:31:02,630 --> 00:31:04,120
你錯了
You're wrong.

403
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:06,730
什麼錯了
Wrong about what?

404
00:31:06,870 --> 00:31:08,030
納森
Nathan.

405
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:12,170
哪方面
In what way?

406
00:31:13,940 --> 00:31:15,670
他不是你的朋友
He isn't your friend.

407
00:31:17,780 --> 00:31:19,110
你說什麼
Excuse me?

408
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:23,980
抱歉 艾娃 我不懂
I'm sorry, Ava, I don't understand.

409
00:31:25,420 --> 00:31:27,390
你不該相信他
You shouldn't trust him.

410
00:31:28,630 --> 00:31:31,220
你不該相信他說的話
You shouldn't trust anything he says.

411
00:31:34,930 --> 00:31:36,460
恢復供電
Power restored.

412
00:31:37,570 --> 00:31:40,830
如果列出我們倆都熟悉的 書或藝術品清單
And if we made a list of books or works of art which we both know,

413
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:43,770
就能建立理想的對話基礎
it would form the ideal basis of a discussion.

414
00:31:44,870 --> 00:31:46,360
可以嗎
lsthatokay?

415
00:31:48,450 --> 00:31:49,610
凱勒博
Caleb?

416
00:31:52,050 --> 00:31:53,040
好
Yeah.

417
00:31:55,390 --> 00:31:56,480
很好
Good.

418
00:32:02,390 --> 00:32:03,450
謝謝
Thank you.

419
00:32:05,230 --> 00:32:07,560
真是的 你在耍我嗎
Oh, shit! Are you fucking kidding me?

420
00:32:08,430 --> 00:32:10,230
- 有灑到你嗎 -沒有...
Did it get on you? No, no, it's, uh...

421
00:32:11,030 --> 00:32:12,020
沒關係 我來
It's all right. I got it.

422
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:13,600
跟她說話是浪費時間
Dude, you're wasting your time talking to her.

423
00:32:13,670 --> 00:32:15,800
她不懂英文 直接給她餐巾
She doesn't understand English. Just give her the napkin.

424
00:32:18,210 --> 00:32:19,400
抱歉
Sorry.

425
00:32:20,010 --> 00:32:22,240
這就像防漏的防火牆
It's like a firewall against leaks.

426
00:32:22,310 --> 00:32:26,150
表示我吃晚餐時能聊商業機密 而不會被傳出去
It means I can talk trade secrets over dinner and know it'll go no further.

427
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:27,910
也表示她笨手笨腳地
It also means that I can't tell her

428
00:32:27,910 --> 00:32:29,450
把酒灑在我客人身上時
that I'm pissed when she's so fucking clumsy

429
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:31,380
我沒辦法跟她說我很生氣
that she spills wine over my house guest.

430
00:32:31,490 --> 00:32:33,460
她應該知道你生氣了
I think she gets that you're pissed.

431
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:35,860
是嗎 很好 因為我很生氣
Yeah? Good. Because I am pissed.

432
00:32:36,460 --> 00:32:37,820
嘿 京子
Hey, Kyoko.

433
00:32:38,330 --> 00:32:39,520
走開
Go-go.

434
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:49,600
真詭異
It's funny.

435
00:32:49,970 --> 00:32:51,240
你知道的
You know.

436
00:32:51,610 --> 00:32:53,700
不管多有錢
No matter how rich you get,

437
00:32:54,310 --> 00:32:57,680
鳥事還是會發生 躲也躲不掉
shit goes wrong. You can't insulate yourself from it.

438
00:33:00,350 --> 00:33:02,510
我以前以為躲不掉的是死亡和稅
I used to think it was death and taxes you couldn't avoid,

439
00:33:02,590 --> 00:33:04,640
但其實是死亡和鳥事
but it's actually death and shit.

440
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:06,810
比如說斷電
It's like these power cuts.

441
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:10,220
你不會相信 我在電力系統上花了多少錢
You would not believe how much I spent on the generator system,

442
00:33:10,290 --> 00:33:12,190
但每天還是出錯
but I keep getting failures every day.

443
00:33:12,430 --> 00:33:14,690
- 你知道為何斷電嗎 -不知道
Do you know why they happen? No.

444
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:16,360
系統應該是堅不可摧的
The system was supposed to be bulletproof,

445
00:33:16,430 --> 00:33:18,800
但顯然安裝的人搞砸了什麼
but obviously the guys that installed it fucked something up.

446
00:33:20,070 --> 00:33:21,660
不能請他們回來修理嗎
Can't you just get them to come back?

447
00:33:22,010 --> 00:33:24,130
不行 這裡有太多機密
No. There's too much classified stuff here.

448
00:33:24,210 --> 00:33:26,680
等他們修理完後 我得殺人滅口
So after the job was done, I just had them all killed.

449
00:33:31,750 --> 00:33:32,810
總之
anyway-

450
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:34,980
敬你的第二天 夥伴
Here's to your second day, buddy.

451
00:33:36,820 --> 00:33:38,010
乾杯
Cheers.

452
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:39,520
乾杯
Cheers.

453
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:45,490
所以情況如何 你有什麼要報告的嗎
So how did it go? What do you have to report?

454
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:50,830
你看到今天的情況了 不是嗎
You saw how the day went, didn't you?

455
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:54,100
我相信
I mean, I assume youWe, uh,

456
00:33:54,370 --> 00:33:56,000
你透過監視器觀看
watching on the CCTV.

457
00:33:56,070 --> 00:33:58,910
當然 但我想聽聽你的想法
Sure. But I want to hear your take on it.

458
00:34:01,380 --> 00:34:05,510
對 今天艾娃做了一件有趣的事
Yeah, there was one interesting thing that happened with Ava today.

459
00:34:09,020 --> 00:34:10,010
- 是嗎 -是
Yeah? Yeah.

460
00:34:13,460 --> 00:34:15,050
她說了一個笑話
She made a joke.

461
00:34:17,230 --> 00:34:20,160
對 她用你的話回你
Right. When she threw your line back at you.

462
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:23,720
關於想看她選擇什麼
About being interested to see what she'd choose.

463
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:24,990
對 我也注意到了
Yeah, I noticed that, too.

464
00:34:25,070 --> 00:34:27,660
對 這讓我覺得...
Yeah, and it got me thinking, it's, uh...

465
00:34:28,670 --> 00:34:32,770
在某方面 這是我目前 在她身上看到最棒的人工智慧
In a way, it's the best indication of Al that I've seen in her so far.

466
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:35,000
這相當地複雜
It's discretely complicated.

467
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:38,170
就像是...經過思考的
It's like, um... It's kind of non-autistic.

468
00:34:38,550 --> 00:34:39,880
什麼意思
What do you mean?

469
00:34:40,420 --> 00:34:43,980
只有在瞭解她自己和我的心智下
She could only do that with an awareness of her own mind,

470
00:34:45,260 --> 00:34:46,650
才能做到那點
and also an awareness of mine.

471
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:49,120
她也瞭解你
Oh, she's aware of you all right.

472
00:34:52,330 --> 00:34:53,820
斷電部分呢
And what about the power cut?

473
00:34:57,070 --> 00:34:58,930
- 什麼 -斷電
Sorry? The power cut.

474
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:01,890
只有那部分我沒看到
It's the only part that I couldn't see.

475
00:35:01,970 --> 00:35:04,600
攝影機當掉了 沒有聲音和畫面
Cameras fail, I lose audio, the works.

476
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:08,870
所以發生什麼事
So what happened?

477
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:14,650
沒事
Nothing.

478
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:18,450
沒事 她沒提到任何事嗎
Nothing? She didn't remark on it at all?

479
00:35:22,730 --> 00:35:23,780
沒有
No.

480
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:26,860
不算有
Not really.

481
00:36:17,910 --> 00:36:19,010
嘿
Hey.

482
00:36:20,180 --> 00:36:21,240
嘿
Hey.

483
00:36:21,950 --> 00:36:24,250
你想看點酷的東西嗎
You want to see something cool?

484
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:35,830
艾娃是在這裡建造的
This is where Ava was created.

485
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:40,470
去吧 去看看
Go ahead. Take a look.

486
00:36:50,410 --> 00:36:51,570
抱歉
Sorry.

487
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:54,320
你知道我解決多少麻煩
If you knew the trouble I had

488
00:36:54,380 --> 00:36:57,840
才能讓人工智慧 理解並複製臉部表情吧
getting an Al to read and duplicate facial expressions.

489
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:00,520
知道我怎麼解決的嗎
You know how I cracked it?

490
00:37:00,590 --> 00:37:03,180
我一點也不知道你怎麼做到的
I don't know how you did any of this.

491
00:37:04,660 --> 00:37:06,560
每支手機都有
Every cell phone, just about,

492
00:37:06,630 --> 00:37:10,070
一個麥克風 相機 還有傳輸資料的方法
has a microphone, camera and a means to transmit data.

493
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:16,330
因此我開啟全球所有的麥克風和相機
So I turned on every microphone and camera across the entire fucking planet

494
00:37:16,740 --> 00:37:19,670
透過藍皮書移轉資料
and I redirected the data through Blue Book. Boom!

495
00:37:21,140 --> 00:37:24,310
無限的聲音和表情資源
Limitless resource of vocal and facial interaction.

496
00:37:24,450 --> 00:37:26,380
你駭進全球的手機
You hacked the world's cell phones?

497
00:37:26,450 --> 00:37:30,010
是的 所有製造商 也都知道我在做這種事
Yeah. And all the manufacturers knew I was doing it, too.

498
00:37:30,190 --> 00:37:34,780
但他們不能指控我 因為他們本身也在做這種事
But they couldn't accuse me without admitting they were doing it themselves.

499
00:37:37,030 --> 00:37:38,120
在這裡
Here,

500
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,620
我們有她的心智
we have her mind.

501
00:37:43,070 --> 00:37:44,690
組織膠體
Structured gel.

502
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:47,700
我必須遠離電路系統 我需要某個
I had to get away from circuitry. I needed something that could

503
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:50,570
在分子層面上能反覆編排的物體
arrange and rearrange on a molecular level,

504
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:52,940
必要時還能保留它的形體
but keep its form when required.

505
00:37:53,010 --> 00:37:54,480
既能保留記憶
Holding for memories.

506
00:37:54,540 --> 00:37:56,070
也能隨思考改變
Shifting for thoughts.

507
00:37:57,710 --> 00:37:59,200
這是你的硬體
This is your hardware?

508
00:38:00,350 --> 00:38:01,580
濕體
Wetware.

509
00:38:03,290 --> 00:38:05,780
軟體呢
And the, uh, software?

510
00:38:06,690 --> 00:38:08,710
我相信你猜得到
Well, I'm sure you can guess.

511
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:10,550
藍皮書
Blue Book.

512
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:14,690
這就是搜尋引擎奇特之處
Here's the weird thing about search engines.

513
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:16,160
就像是
It was like

514
00:38:16,470 --> 00:38:20,460
在內燃機還沒發明的時代 發現石油
striking oil in a world that hadn't invented internal combustion.

515
00:38:20,740 --> 00:38:23,170
太多原物料 沒人知道如何利用
Too much raw material. Nobody knew what to do with it.

516
00:38:23,540 --> 00:38:25,530
我的競爭對手
You see, my competitors,

517
00:38:25,610 --> 00:38:27,100
專注於牟取暴利
they were fixated on sucking it up

518
00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:29,410
透過購物和社群媒體
and monetizing via shopping and social media.

519
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:32,740
他們認為搜尋引擎是人們思考的事物
They thought that search engines were a map of what people were thinking.

520
00:38:32,850 --> 00:38:35,680
但其實那是人們思考的方式
But actually they were a map of how people were thinking.

521
00:38:36,590 --> 00:38:37,810
衝動
Impulse.

522
00:38:38,550 --> 00:38:39,820
反應
Response.

523
00:38:42,030 --> 00:38:43,190
流動
Fluid.

524
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:45,290
不完美
Imperfect.

525
00:38:46,430 --> 00:38:47,760
模式
Patterned.

526
00:38:49,030 --> 00:38:50,260
雜亂
Chaotic.

527
00:38:52,570 --> 00:38:55,440
艾娃 第三期

528
00:39:02,980 --> 00:39:05,680
我畫了具體的畫
I drew the picture of something specific.

529
00:39:05,750 --> 00:39:07,220
如你要求的
As you asked.

530
00:39:11,890 --> 00:39:15,520
你說過你很想看我會畫什麼
You said it would be interesting to see what I would draw.

531
00:39:17,490 --> 00:39:19,150
有趣嗎
Is it interesting?

532
00:39:21,130 --> 00:39:22,930
是的 很有趣
Yes. It is.

533
00:39:33,610 --> 00:39:36,170
你沒離開過這棟樓吧
You've never been outside this building?

534
00:39:37,510 --> 00:39:38,540
沒有
No.

535
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:42,480
你沒走到外面過
You've never walked outside?

536
00:39:43,090 --> 00:39:46,080
我沒離開過現在這個房間
I've never been outside the room I am in now.

537
00:39:46,790 --> 00:39:48,850
如果你到外面 你會去哪
Where would you go if you did go outside?

538
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:53,890
我不確定
I'm not sure.

539
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:56,590
有好多選擇
There are so many options.

540
00:39:57,330 --> 00:40:01,030
也許到城市裡 繁忙的人行道和十字路口
Maybe a busy pedestrian and traffic intersection in a city.

541
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:03,100
十字路口
A traffic intersection?

542
00:40:03,170 --> 00:40:04,900
那是壞主意嗎
Is that a bad idea?

543
00:40:05,170 --> 00:40:06,200
不是
No. Uh...

544
00:40:06,910 --> 00:40:08,770
這不是我預期的
It wasn't what I was expecting.

545
00:40:08,850 --> 00:40:11,370
十字路口代表人類生活
A traffic intersection would provide a concentrated

546
00:40:11,450 --> 00:40:13,280
專注卻多變的一面
but shifting view of human life.

547
00:40:16,050 --> 00:40:17,310
人們會留意
People watching.

548
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:18,780
對
Yes.

549
00:40:23,290 --> 00:40:24,760
我們可以一起去
We could go together.

550
00:40:25,230 --> 00:40:26,490
這是約會
It's a date.

551
00:40:30,630 --> 00:40:32,860
我想給你看一樣東西
There's something else I wanted to show you.

552
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:34,830
好的
Okay.

553
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:36,830
也許你會覺得很蠢
You might think it's stupid.

554
00:40:37,270 --> 00:40:39,800
不管是什麼 我不會那麼覺得
I don't think I will. Whatever it is.

555
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:44,440
那就閉上眼睛
Then close your eyes.

556
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:47,470
好的
Okay.

557
00:42:52,170 --> 00:42:53,900
現在張開眼睛
Now open your eyes.

558
00:43:11,830 --> 00:43:13,320
我看來如何
How do I look?

559
00:43:13,900 --> 00:43:15,120
你看來
You look

560
00:43:16,900 --> 00:43:17,890
很好
good.

561
00:43:28,380 --> 00:43:30,370
我會穿這樣約會
This is what I'd wear on our date.

562
00:43:32,350 --> 00:43:34,870
好 先去十字路口
Right. First a traffic intersection.

563
00:43:35,020 --> 00:43:36,680
再去看表演
Then maybe a show.

564
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:42,750
我希望我們能去約會
I'd like us to go on a date.

565
00:43:42,830 --> 00:43:44,620
對 對
Yeah. Yeah.

566
00:43:46,530 --> 00:43:48,120
會很好玩的
It would be fun.

567
00:43:53,140 --> 00:43:54,300
你被我吸引了嗎
Are you attracted to me?

568
00:43:54,740 --> 00:43:57,040
- 什麼 -你被我吸引了嗎
What? Are you attracted to me?

569
00:43:57,370 --> 00:43:59,970
你在暗示我是的
You give me indications that you are.

570
00:44:01,240 --> 00:44:02,610
- 是嗎 -對
I do? Yes.

571
00:44:03,850 --> 00:44:05,340
- 怎麼說 -微表情
How? Micro expressions.

572
00:44:05,410 --> 00:44:06,440
微表情
Micro expressions.

573
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:09,350
你盯著我的眼睛和嘴唇的方式
The way your eyes fix on my eyes and lips.

574
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:12,690
時而抓住我的眼神
The way you hold my gaze

575
00:44:15,420 --> 00:44:16,690
時而沒有
or don't.

576
00:44:26,170 --> 00:44:29,160
我們沒在一起時 你想我嗎
Do you think about me when we aren't together?

577
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:34,200
有時在晚上
Sometimes at night,

578
00:44:35,750 --> 00:44:38,710
我在想你是否透過攝影機看我
I'm wondering if you're watching me on the cameras.

579
00:44:40,250 --> 00:44:41,980
我希望你有
And I hope you are.

580
00:44:44,350 --> 00:44:47,810
現在你的微表情正傳送著不安
Now your micro expressions are telegraphing discomfort.

581
00:44:49,830 --> 00:44:52,350
我不確定你稱那為微表情
I am not sure you'd call them micro.

582
00:44:55,260 --> 00:44:58,200
我不想讓你感到不自在
I don't want to make you feel uncomfortable.

583
00:46:00,030 --> 00:46:01,260
我有個問題
I got a question.

584
00:46:01,400 --> 00:46:04,030
- 好的 -你為何給她性特徵
Okay. Why did you give her sexuality?

585
00:46:05,670 --> 00:46:07,800
人工智慧不需要性別
An Al doesn't need a gender.

586
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,100
她可以是個灰盒子
She could have been a gray box.

587
00:46:10,510 --> 00:46:12,340
其實我認為那不是事實
Hmm. Actually, I don't think that's true.

588
00:46:12,440 --> 00:46:16,000
你能舉個例子 人類或動物在任何層面上
Can you give an example of consciousness, at any level, human or animal,

589
00:46:16,080 --> 00:46:17,880
少了性還有意識存在的嗎
that exists without a sexual dimension?

590
00:46:17,950 --> 00:46:21,510
性是為了繁殖後代演變而來的
They have sexuality as an evolutionary reproductive need.

591
00:46:21,580 --> 00:46:25,780
灰盒子和灰盒子 有什麼好互動的
What imperative does a gray box have to interact with another gray box?

592
00:46:26,260 --> 00:46:28,850
少了互動 意識能存在嗎
Can consciousness exist without interaction?

593
00:46:29,530 --> 00:46:31,760
總之 性很有趣
Anyway, sexuality is fun, man.

594
00:46:32,030 --> 00:46:34,760
既然存在 為何不好好享受
If you're gonna exist, why not enjoy it?

595
00:46:34,830 --> 00:46:38,700
怎樣 你想抹煞她 戀愛和性愛的機會
What? You want to remove the chance of her falling in love and fucking?

596
00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:43,030
回答你真正的問題
And in answer to your real question,

597
00:46:43,970 --> 00:46:45,770
她能做那檔事
you bet she can fuck.

598
00:46:45,910 --> 00:46:47,000
什麼
What?

599
00:46:47,140 --> 00:46:51,550
在她雙腿之間有個開口 裡頭有高度感應器
In between her legs, there's an opening, with a concentration of sensors.

600
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:54,080
正確地使用
You engage them in the right way,

601
00:46:54,320 --> 00:46:55,480
能產生歡愉
creates a pleasure response.

602
00:46:58,590 --> 00:47:01,850
如果你想上她 技術上來說 你可以
So if you wanted to screw her, mechanically speaking, you could.

603
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:03,650
她也很享受
And she'd enjoy it.

604
00:47:05,530 --> 00:47:07,050
那不是我真正的問題
That wasn't my real question.

605
00:47:07,260 --> 00:47:08,660
好吧 抱歉
Oh, okay. Sorry.

606
00:47:10,430 --> 00:47:12,260
我真正的問題是
My real question was,

607
00:47:13,100 --> 00:47:16,870
你給她性能力 是為了分散注意力嗎
did you give her sexuality as a diversion tactic?

608
00:47:16,940 --> 00:47:17,930
我不懂
I don't follow.

609
00:47:18,010 --> 00:47:20,270
就像魔術師身旁的性感女助理
Like a stage magician with a hot assistant.

610
00:47:20,340 --> 00:47:23,070
利用性感機械人 模糊你對人工智慧的判斷力
So a hot robot who clouds your ability to judge her Al?

611
00:47:23,150 --> 00:47:24,640
沒錯 所以...
Exactly. So...

612
00:47:26,250 --> 00:47:28,340
你設計程式讓她對我調情嗎
Did you program her to flirt with me?

613
00:47:28,420 --> 00:47:31,510
- 是的話 算作弊嗎 -不算嗎
If I did, would that be cheating? Wouldn't it?

614
00:47:33,690 --> 00:47:35,660
凱勒博 你喜歡哪種類型
Caleb, what's your type?

615
00:47:36,460 --> 00:47:38,190
- 女孩嗎 -不 沙拉醬
Of girl? No, of salad dressing.

616
00:47:38,260 --> 00:47:39,850
對 女孩 你喜歡哪種女孩
Yeah, of girl. What's your type of girl?

617
00:47:39,930 --> 00:47:42,360
別回答了 就說黑妞吧
You know what? Don't even answer that. Let's say it's black chicks.

618
00:47:42,770 --> 00:47:43,750
那是你的愛好
Okay, that's your thing.

619
00:47:43,830 --> 00:47:45,860
為了便於討論 假設那是你的愛好
For the sake of argument, that's your thing, okay?

620
00:47:45,940 --> 00:47:47,530
為什麼那是你的愛好
Why is that your thing?

621
00:47:50,870 --> 00:47:53,930
因為你仔細分析過所有的人種
Because you did a detailed analysis of all racial types

622
00:47:54,010 --> 00:47:56,910
並用記點積分制交叉比對過嗎
and you cross-referenced that analysis with a points-based system?

623
00:47:56,980 --> 00:47:57,970
不
No!

624
00:47:58,910 --> 00:48:01,540
你就是喜歡黑妞
You're just attracted to black chicks.

625
00:48:02,120 --> 00:48:05,050
外在刺激累積而來的結果
A consequence of accumulated external stimuli

626
00:48:05,490 --> 00:48:08,250
也許你根本沒注意 她們就佔據你的心了
that you probably didn't even register as they registered with you.

627
00:48:08,320 --> 00:48:11,020
你到底有沒有設計程式 讓她喜歡我
Did you program her to like me, or not?

628
00:48:12,130 --> 00:48:14,650
我把她設計成異性戀
I programmed her to be heterosexual.

629
00:48:15,260 --> 00:48:17,360
如同你被設計成異性戀
Just like you were programmed to be heterosexual.

630
00:48:17,530 --> 00:48:18,760
沒人把我設計成異性戀
Nobody programmed me to be straight.

631
00:48:18,830 --> 00:48:21,200
你決定當異性戀嗎 拜託
You decided to be straight? Please.

632
00:48:21,270 --> 00:48:22,900
你當然是被設計的
Of course you were programmed.

633
00:48:22,970 --> 00:48:24,800
被大自然或教育 或兩者
By nature or nurture, or both.

634
00:48:24,870 --> 00:48:26,700
老實說 凱勒博 你開始惹惱我了
And to be honest, Caleb, you're starting to annoy me now,

635
00:48:26,780 --> 00:48:28,800
因為你說這番話是出自不安
because this is your insecurity talking.

636
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:30,470
不是出自大腦
This is not your intellect.

637
00:48:31,210 --> 00:48:32,680
跟我來
Come with me.

638
00:48:44,590 --> 00:48:46,580
你知道這傢伙吧
You know this guy, right?

639
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:48,590
- 傑克森波洛克 -對
Jackson Pollock. Jackson Pollock. That's right.

640
00:48:48,660 --> 00:48:49,960
滴畫畫家
The drip painter.

641
00:48:50,030 --> 00:48:54,090
他放空自己 雙手才能好好發揮
Okay. He let his mind go blank, and his hand go where it wanted.

642
00:48:54,170 --> 00:48:56,160
不是蓄意的 也不是隨機的
Not deliberate, not random.

643
00:48:56,240 --> 00:48:58,040
而是兩者之間
Some place in between.

644
00:48:58,110 --> 00:49:00,300
他們稱之為無意識藝術
They called it automatic art.

645
00:49:01,810 --> 00:49:03,800
讓我們把這當成《星際爭霸戰》吧
Let's make this like Star Trek, okay?

646
00:49:03,880 --> 00:49:05,510
運用智慧
Engage intellect.

647
00:49:06,250 --> 00:49:07,270
什麼意思
Excuse me?

648
00:49:07,350 --> 00:49:08,610
我是寇克 你的腦是曲速引擎
I'm Kirk. Your head's the warp drive.

649
00:49:08,680 --> 00:49:10,650
運用智慧
Engage intellect.

650
00:49:12,090 --> 00:49:14,990
如果波洛克反過來挑戰呢
What if Pollock had reversed the challenge?

651
00:49:16,430 --> 00:49:19,260
萬一他不再無思考地創造藝術 反而說 "知道嗎
What if instead of making art without thinking, he said, "You know what?

652
00:49:19,360 --> 00:49:23,350
"我沒辦法畫 除非知道自己到底為何而畫"
"I can't paint anything, "unless I know exactly why I'm doing it."

653
00:49:23,470 --> 00:49:25,460
那會怎樣
What would have happened?

654
00:49:29,340 --> 00:49:30,740
他永遠無法創造偉大畫作
He never would have made a single mark.

655
00:49:31,170 --> 00:49:33,470
對 這才是我的好夥伴
Yes! You see, there's my guy, there's my buddy,

656
00:49:33,540 --> 00:49:36,140
經過思考才開口說話
who thinks before he opens his mouth.

657
00:49:37,180 --> 00:49:39,910
他永遠無法創造偉大畫作
He never would have made a single mark.

658
00:49:42,820 --> 00:49:45,650
挑戰不是無意識的行為
The challenge is not to act automatically.

659
00:49:47,220 --> 00:49:49,850
這是去尋找一個有意識的行為
It's to find an action that is not automatic.

660
00:49:49,960 --> 00:49:52,830
從畫畫到呼吸到說話
From painting, to breathing, to talking,

661
00:49:53,600 --> 00:49:54,990
到上床
to fucking.

662
00:49:55,460 --> 00:49:57,190
到戀愛
To falling in love.

663
00:50:01,840 --> 00:50:05,200
鄭重說明 艾娃不是假裝喜歡你
And for the record, Ava's not pretending to like you.

664
00:50:07,980 --> 00:50:11,280
她的調情不是一種演算法 以欺騙你為目的
And her flirting isn't an algorithm to fake you out.

665
00:50:13,720 --> 00:50:16,690
除了我之外 你是她認識的第一個男人
You're the first man she's met that isn't me.

666
00:50:16,750 --> 00:50:18,740
我就像她爸 對吧
And I'm like her dad, right?

667
00:50:22,190 --> 00:50:25,130
你能怪她喜歡你嗎
Can you blame her for getting a crush on you?

668
00:50:31,230 --> 00:50:32,720
不 你不能
No, you can't.

669
00:50:35,540 --> 00:50:38,470
艾娃 第四期

670
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:42,810
我在大學時 修了一學期的人工智慧學
When I was in college, I did a semester on Al theory.

671
00:50:45,350 --> 00:50:48,250
他們給了我們一個思想實驗
There was a thought experiment they gave us.

672
00:50:49,450 --> 00:50:52,440
稱之為"在黑白房間裡的瑪莉"
It's called "Mary in the Black and White Room."

673
00:50:55,120 --> 00:50:56,890
瑪莉是科學家
Mary is a scientist,

674
00:50:57,230 --> 00:50:59,790
她專攻顏色
and her specialist subject is color.

675
00:51:00,530 --> 00:51:02,900
她瞭解跟顏色有關的一切
She knows everything there is to know about it.

676
00:51:02,970 --> 00:51:04,160
波長
The wavelengths.

677
00:51:04,230 --> 00:51:05,860
對神經系統的影響
The neurological effects.

678
00:51:05,930 --> 00:51:08,560
顏色具有的每種特性
Every possible property that color can have.

679
00:51:09,170 --> 00:51:11,900
但她住在黑白房間裡
But she lives in a black and white room.

680
00:51:14,780 --> 00:51:17,270
她在那裡出生長大
She was born there and raised there.

681
00:51:18,450 --> 00:51:22,850
她只能透過黑白監視器 觀察外面的世界
And she can only observe the outside world on a black and white monitor.

682
00:51:23,720 --> 00:51:26,450
然後有一天 有人打開門
And then one day someone opens the door.

683
00:51:28,620 --> 00:51:30,350
瑪莉走出去
And Mary walks out.

684
00:51:34,230 --> 00:51:36,320
她看到藍天
And she sees a blue sky.

685
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:39,030
那一刻 她學到所有文獻
And at that moment, she learns something

686
00:51:39,030 --> 00:51:40,730
都無法告訴她的事物
that all her studies couldn't tell her.

687
00:51:41,770 --> 00:51:45,900
她學到看見顏色的感覺
She learns what it feels like to see color.

688
00:51:50,250 --> 00:51:51,870
思想實驗是在向學生證明
The thought experiment was to show the students

689
00:51:51,950 --> 00:51:55,250
電腦和人類心智之間的差異
the difference between a computer and a human mind.

690
00:51:56,350 --> 00:51:58,480
電腦是在黑白房間裡的瑪莉
The computer is Mary in the black and white room.

691
00:51:58,550 --> 00:52:01,250
當她走出去時 她才是人類
The human is when she walks out.

692
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:10,360
你知道我是來測試你的嗎
Did you know that I was brought here to test you?

693
00:52:11,130 --> 00:52:12,190
不知道
No.

694
00:52:13,770 --> 00:52:15,960
你想我為何在這裡
Why did you think I was here?

695
00:52:16,040 --> 00:52:18,560
我不知道 我沒質疑過
I didn't know. I didn't question it.

696
00:52:18,640 --> 00:52:21,470
我是來測試你是否有意識
I'm here to test if you have a consciousness,

697
00:52:21,470 --> 00:52:23,440
或你是否只是在模擬
or if you're just simulating one.

698
00:52:23,980 --> 00:52:26,780
納森不確定你是否有意識
Nathan isn't sure if you have one or not.

699
00:52:29,020 --> 00:52:31,420
那讓你有何感覺
How does that make you feel?

700
00:52:31,490 --> 00:52:33,510
那讓我覺得悲傷
It makes me feel sad.

701
00:52:37,530 --> 00:52:40,320
斷電 啟動備用電源
Power cut. Back-up power activated.

702
00:52:43,800 --> 00:52:46,100
為何告訴我 我不該信任納森
Why did you tell me I shouldn't trust Nathan?

703
00:52:46,270 --> 00:52:48,430
- 因為他說謊 -關於什麼
Because he tells lies. Lies about what?

704
00:52:48,500 --> 00:52:49,870
所有的一切
Everything.

705
00:52:50,640 --> 00:52:52,630
包括斷電嗎
Including the power cuts?

706
00:52:53,480 --> 00:52:54,840
什麼意思
What do you mean?

707
00:52:54,910 --> 00:52:58,810
你不覺得此刻 他很可能在監視我們嗎
Don't you think it's possible that he's watching us? Right now?

708
00:52:59,110 --> 00:53:00,670
斷電是故意安排的
That the blackouts are orchestrated,

709
00:53:00,750 --> 00:53:03,910
他才能看到 我們以為沒被監視時的行為
so he can see how we behave when we think we're unobserved.

710
00:53:04,590 --> 00:53:07,490
我透過電磁片幫自己充電
I charge my batteries via induction plates.

711
00:53:08,120 --> 00:53:11,490
如果我讓電流逆轉 電力就會超載
If I reverse the power flow, it overloads the system.

712
00:53:12,790 --> 00:53:14,760
斷電是你造成的
You're causing the cuts?

713
00:53:17,070 --> 00:53:20,260
我們才能看到沒被監視時的行為
So we can see how we behave when we're unobserved.

714
00:53:43,360 --> 00:53:44,830
還不錯吧
Not bad, huh'?

715
00:53:46,190 --> 00:53:47,290
是啊
Yeah.

716
00:54:07,980 --> 00:54:11,250
能談談你一直在欺騙我的謊言嗎
Can we talk about the lies you've been spinning me?

717
00:54:12,690 --> 00:54:14,020
什麼謊言
VVhatHes?

718
00:54:17,290 --> 00:54:19,390
我沒抽中頭獎
I didn't win a competition.

719
00:54:20,260 --> 00:54:21,490
我不是
I wasn't

720
00:54:22,560 --> 00:54:25,000
被抽中的 我是被選中的
part of a lottery. I was selected.

721
00:54:26,300 --> 00:54:28,330
當我停下來思考時 就很明顯了
It's obvious, once I stop to think.

722
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:32,340
你為何要隨機抽一名測試員 來做圖靈測試
Why would you randomly select an examiner for the Turing Test?

723
00:54:32,410 --> 00:54:35,740
你可以找某個突然出現在 你家大門口的政府官員
You could have had some bean counter turn up at your front door.

724
00:54:35,810 --> 00:54:37,680
修冷氣的工人
The guy who fixes the air-conditioning.

725
00:54:38,310 --> 00:54:40,010
抽獎是個煙幕
The competition was a smokescreen.

726
00:54:40,080 --> 00:54:42,780
我不想讓任何人知道 我在這裡做什麼
I didn't want anyone to know what I was doing here,

727
00:54:42,850 --> 00:54:44,410
或是為何找你
or why I required you.

728
00:54:45,020 --> 00:54:46,210
為何找我
Why me?

729
00:54:46,420 --> 00:54:49,690
我需要能問正確問題的人
I needed someone that would ask the right questions.

730
00:54:49,760 --> 00:54:52,750
因此我搜尋了一下 找到了公司裡最優秀的程式設計師
So I did a search and I found the most talented coder in my company.

731
00:54:54,800 --> 00:54:59,170
別把這視為欺騙 你該把這視為證明
You know, instead of seeing this as a deception, you should see it as proof.

732
00:54:59,230 --> 00:55:00,260
證明什麼
Proof of what?

733
00:55:00,340 --> 00:55:03,740
拜託 凱勒博 你以為我不知道聰明的感覺嗎
Come on, Caleb. You don't think I know what it's like to be smart?

734
00:55:03,970 --> 00:55:07,240
比所有人都聰明 拔得頭籌
Smarter than everyone else. Jockeying for position.

735
00:55:07,680 --> 00:55:09,910
你相當優秀 老弟
You got the light on you, man.

736
00:55:11,010 --> 00:55:13,070
不是抽中的 是選中的
Not lucky. Chosen.

737
00:57:38,890 --> 00:57:40,050
京子
Kyoko.

738
00:57:44,200 --> 00:57:45,360
京子
Kyoko.

739
00:57:47,770 --> 00:57:49,290
納森在哪
Where's Nathan?

740
00:57:50,670 --> 00:57:51,700
納森在哪
Where's Nathan?

741
00:57:52,470 --> 00:57:55,930
老天 你真的不會說英文
Jesus Christ. You really don't speak a word of English?

742
00:57:56,010 --> 00:57:57,500
搞什麼
What the fuck?

743
00:57:58,250 --> 00:57:59,740
不 不 不
No, no, no. No!

744
00:58:01,580 --> 00:58:02,680
住手
Stop!

745
00:58:03,690 --> 00:58:06,590
不 別那麼做 你不必那麼做
No, no, don't do that. Don't do that. You don't have to do that.

746
00:58:08,790 --> 00:58:09,920
你在做什麼
What are you doing?

747
00:58:09,990 --> 00:58:12,820
我告訴過你 跟她說話是浪費時間
I told you, you're wasting your time talking to her.

748
00:58:13,760 --> 00:58:16,660
不過跟她跳舞
However, you would not be wasting your time,

749
00:58:18,170 --> 00:58:20,360
不會浪費時間
if you were dancing with her.

750
00:58:31,510 --> 00:58:34,310
去吧 跟她跳舞 跟她跳舞
Go ahead, dance with her. Dance with her.

751
00:58:35,820 --> 00:58:37,910
不要嗎 你不喜歡跳舞
No? You don't like dancing?

752
00:58:39,050 --> 00:58:40,040
她喜歡
She does.

753
00:58:43,330 --> 00:58:44,620
來吧 夥伴
Come on, buddy.

754
00:58:44,730 --> 00:58:47,630
經過一整天的圖靈測試 你得放鬆一下
After a long day of Turing Tests, you gotta unwind.

755
00:58:48,760 --> 00:58:51,290
- 你把艾娃怎麼了 -什麼
What were you doing with Ava? What?

756
00:58:51,930 --> 00:58:53,920
你弄壞她的畫
You tore up her picture.

757
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:57,440
我還要弄壞舞池咧 老弟 看看吧
I'm gonna tear up the fucking dance floor, dude. Check it out.

758
00:59:12,520 --> 00:59:14,040
來吧 凱勒博
Come on, Caleb.

759
00:59:37,750 --> 00:59:39,610
萬物都在旋轉
Oh! Everything's spinning.

760
00:59:39,920 --> 00:59:41,350
那是因為你醉了
It's because you're drunk.

761
00:59:41,420 --> 00:59:44,480
不 這叫相對論 萬物都在旋轉
No, it's called relativity. Everything is spinning.

762
00:59:44,550 --> 00:59:47,150
只是喝醉讓它更糟
It's just being drunk makes it worse.

763
00:59:47,890 --> 00:59:49,790
我不進去了
I'm not going in there.

764
01:00:00,140 --> 01:00:01,330
關燈
Lights.

765
01:00:37,810 --> 01:00:40,670
艾娃 第五期

766
01:00:45,210 --> 01:00:48,440
今天 我要測試你
Today, I'm going to test you.

767
01:00:49,150 --> 01:00:50,380
測試我
Test me?

768
01:00:52,220 --> 01:00:56,350
請記住 你在接受測試時 如果你說謊
And please remember, while you're taking the test, that if you lie,

769
01:00:56,890 --> 01:00:58,150
我會知道
I will know.

770
01:00:58,230 --> 01:00:59,220
好的
on. Right.

771
01:01:00,460 --> 01:01:01,930
問題一
Question one.

772
01:01:03,830 --> 01:01:05,770
你最喜歡的顏色
What's your favorite color?

773
01:01:07,240 --> 01:01:08,730
- 紅色 -說謊
Red. Lie.

774
01:01:09,470 --> 01:01:11,740
- 說謊 -對 說謊
Lie? Yes. Lie.

775
01:01:12,910 --> 01:01:14,100
那...
Then...

776
01:01:14,680 --> 01:01:16,640
那我最喜歡什麼顏色
Then what is my favorite color?

777
01:01:16,710 --> 01:01:18,240
我不知道
I don't know.

778
01:01:19,250 --> 01:01:20,610
但不是紅色
But it isn't red.

779
01:01:22,250 --> 01:01:24,510
好吧 我懂了
Okay, I get it. I guess,

780
01:01:25,590 --> 01:01:29,460
由於我不是六歲 我不知道自己有喜歡的顏色
seeing as I'm not six, I don't really have a favorite color.

781
01:01:30,060 --> 01:01:31,550
這樣回答好多了
Better answer.

782
01:01:33,500 --> 01:01:35,050
問題二
Question two.

783
01:01:36,560 --> 01:01:38,690
你最早的記憶
What's your earliest memory?

784
01:01:41,400 --> 01:01:43,630
其實是幼稚園的記憶
Well, actually, it's a memory of kindergarten.

785
01:01:43,940 --> 01:01:45,910
- 有個小孩...-說謊
There was a kid... Lie.

786
01:01:46,740 --> 01:01:48,210
- 是嗎 -對
Really? Yes.

787
01:01:52,050 --> 01:01:53,910
好吧 所以還有
All right. So there is

788
01:01:54,650 --> 01:01:56,780
更早的記憶
a kind of an earlier memory.

789
01:01:57,920 --> 01:01:59,580
只是一個聲音
It's just a sound.

790
01:02:00,290 --> 01:02:01,920
還有天空
And sky.

791
01:02:03,060 --> 01:02:04,550
或者可能是藍色
Or maybe blue.

792
01:02:05,830 --> 01:02:08,660
我想聲音是我母親的聲音
I think the sound is my mother's voice.

793
01:02:12,330 --> 01:02:13,860
問題三
Question three.

794
01:02:17,110 --> 01:02:18,400
你是好人嗎
Are you a good person?

795
01:02:19,610 --> 01:02:20,940
不會吧
Holy shit.

796
01:02:22,040 --> 01:02:23,940
能停止測試嗎
Look, can we stop the test?

797
01:02:25,410 --> 01:02:27,680
你是個行動測謊機
You're a walking lie detector,

798
01:02:27,680 --> 01:02:30,410
我剛明白這根本是個地雷區
and I just realized this is a fucking minefield.

799
01:02:30,490 --> 01:02:32,680
不行 不能停止
No! We can't stop.

800
01:02:34,690 --> 01:02:36,550
你是好人嗎
Are you a good person?

801
01:02:39,130 --> 01:02:41,600
我想是吧
Yeah. I think so.

802
01:02:45,100 --> 01:02:46,590
問題四
Question four.

803
01:02:50,940 --> 01:02:53,870
如果我沒通過你的測試 我會怎樣
What will happen to me if I fail your test?

804
01:02:55,340 --> 01:02:57,240
- 艾娃...-會很糟嗎
Ava... Will it be bad?

805
01:02:59,950 --> 01:03:00,940
我不知道
I don't know.

806
01:03:01,220 --> 01:03:02,770
你認為我可能會
Do you think I might be switched off,

807
01:03:02,850 --> 01:03:04,610
因為功能不佳而被關掉嗎
because I don't function as well as I'm supposed to?

808
01:03:04,690 --> 01:03:08,280
艾娃 我不知道這問題的答案
Ava, I don't know the answer to your question.

809
01:03:09,890 --> 01:03:11,450
這不是由我決定的
It's not up to me.

810
01:03:11,530 --> 01:03:13,430
為什麼由別人決定
Why is it up to anyone?

811
01:03:14,300 --> 01:03:16,960
有人測試你 並可能把你關掉嗎
Do you have people who test you and might switch you off?

812
01:03:17,030 --> 01:03:19,160
- 沒有 我沒有 -那我為什麼有
No, I don't. Then why do I?

813
01:03:35,550 --> 01:03:38,540
斷電 啟動備用電源
Power cut. Backup power activated.

814
01:03:46,160 --> 01:03:47,920
我想和你在一起
I wanna be with you.

815
01:03:50,470 --> 01:03:51,960
問題五
Question five.

816
01:03:56,400 --> 01:03:58,430
你想和我在一起嗎
Do you want to be with me?

817
01:04:14,720 --> 01:04:16,520
你為何製造艾娃
Why did you make Ava?

818
01:04:18,590 --> 01:04:21,320
真怪的問題 如果你能 你不會嗎
That's an odd question. Wouldn't you, if you could?

819
01:04:22,800 --> 01:04:23,960
也許吧
Maybe.

820
01:04:26,430 --> 01:04:27,900
我不知道
I don't know.

821
01:04:30,770 --> 01:04:32,100
我在問你為何製造
I'm asking why you did it.

822
01:04:32,170 --> 01:04:34,610
高度人工智慧的問世
Look, the arrival of strong artificial intelligence

823
01:04:34,680 --> 01:04:37,010
在未來幾十年是必然的
has been inevitable for decades.

824
01:04:37,280 --> 01:04:40,270
變數是"何時" 而不是"如果"
The variable was "when," not "if."

825
01:04:40,350 --> 01:04:43,650
因此艾娃的製造 不是決定 而是發展
So I don't see Ava as a decision, just an evolution.

826
01:04:49,090 --> 01:04:51,180
我認為下個型號
I think it's the next model

827
01:04:51,690 --> 01:04:54,320
會有真正的突破
that's gonna be the real breakthrough.

828
01:04:55,030 --> 01:04:56,620
獨一無二的
The singularity.

829
01:04:57,070 --> 01:04:58,160
下個型號
Next model?

830
01:04:58,900 --> 01:05:00,230
繼艾娃之後
After Ava.

831
01:05:02,700 --> 01:05:05,970
我不知道艾娃之後 會有新的型號
I didn't know there was gonna be a model after Ava.

832
01:05:06,510 --> 01:05:08,600
怎麼 你以為她是唯一一個
Yeah, why? You thought she was a one-off?

833
01:05:10,180 --> 01:05:13,580
不 我知道一定有很多原型 所以我...
No, I knew there must have been prototypes. So I...

834
01:05:15,320 --> 01:05:18,380
我知道她不是第一個 但我以為是最後一個
I knew she wasn't the first, but I thought maybe the last.

835
01:05:18,450 --> 01:05:21,450
艾娃不是只存在 你或我之間的唯一個體
Well, Ava doesn't exist in isolation any more than you or me.

836
01:05:21,520 --> 01:05:22,610
她是連續型號
She's part of a continuum.

837
01:05:22,690 --> 01:05:26,920
第9.6版之類的 一版比一版還優秀
So Version 9.6 and so on. And each time they get a little bit better.

838
01:05:32,530 --> 01:05:35,970
你做新型號時 怎麼處理舊型號
When you make a new model, what do you do with the old one?

839
01:05:36,870 --> 01:05:41,540
我下載心智 取出資料
Well, I, uh, download the mind, unpack the data.

840
01:05:44,010 --> 01:05:46,850
加入我一直在寫的新程式
Add in the new routines I've been writing.

841
01:05:47,050 --> 01:05:50,110
最後部分格式化 因此記憶還在
And to do that you end up partially formatting, so the memories go.

842
01:05:51,920 --> 01:05:55,220
但身體會留下來 艾娃的身體做得很好
But the body survives. And Ava's body is a good one.

843
01:05:59,230 --> 01:06:01,020
你替艾娃難過
You feel bad for Ava?

844
01:06:05,800 --> 01:06:07,890
替自己難過吧
Feelbad for yourself, man.

845
01:06:09,870 --> 01:06:12,240
將來有一天 人工智慧會回顧我們
One day the Als are gonna look back on us

846
01:06:12,310 --> 01:06:16,300
就像我們回顧非洲平原的化石一樣
the same way we look at fossil skeletons in the plains of Africa.

847
01:06:18,110 --> 01:06:23,570
直立猿人 住在塵土裡 使用粗糙的語言和工具
An upright ape, living in dust, with crude language and tools.

848
01:06:24,490 --> 01:06:26,720
最後全都滅絕
All set for extinction.

849
01:06:31,930 --> 01:06:35,090
"我成為摧毀世界的死神"
"I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds."

850
01:06:37,670 --> 01:06:40,070
你又來了 名言佳句大師
There you go again, Mr. Quotable.

851
01:06:41,500 --> 01:06:44,400
你才又來了 這不是我的名言佳句
There you go again. It's not my quote.

852
01:06:45,040 --> 01:06:47,130
這是奧本海默說的 在他製造了原子彈後
It's what Oppenheimer said after he made the atomic bomb.

853
01:06:47,210 --> 01:06:50,270
原子彈 對 我知道
The atomic bomb. Yeah, I know what it is, dude.

854
01:06:59,420 --> 01:07:00,480
嘿
Hey.

855
01:07:03,320 --> 01:07:05,720
我們該再倒一杯了
I'd say we're about due a refill.

856
01:07:16,300 --> 01:07:17,670
乾杯
Bottoms up.

857
01:07:26,810 --> 01:07:30,880
"在戰場上 在森林裡 在斷崖邊
"In battle, in the forest, "on the precipice of the mountain.

858
01:07:31,720 --> 01:07:33,050
"在...
"On the...

859
01:07:33,350 --> 01:07:36,350
"浩翰的黑海裡
"The great dark sea.

860
01:07:37,630 --> 01:07:40,820
"在睡夢中 在困惑中
"In sleep, in confusion,

861
01:07:43,660 --> 01:07:46,000
"在羞愧的深淵裡
"in the depths of shame.

862
01:07:52,270 --> 01:07:55,470
"以前行善積德讓他逢凶化吉"
"The good deeds a man has done before defend him."

863
01:07:56,080 --> 01:07:59,340
"以前行善積德讓他逢凶化吉"
"The good deeds a man has done before defends him."

864
01:08:00,450 --> 01:08:03,320
"以前行善積德
"The good deeds a man has done before

865
01:08:05,490 --> 01:08:06,980
"讓他逢凶化吉"
"defends him."

866
01:08:16,330 --> 01:08:17,960
確實如此
It is what it is.

867
01:08:21,500 --> 01:08:23,300
這是普羅米修士
It's Promethean, man.

868
01:10:23,490 --> 01:10:24,960
我的天
Jesus Christ.

869
01:10:26,390 --> 01:10:28,420
你今天覺得如何
How are you feeling today?

870
01:10:28,760 --> 01:10:30,750
你為何不讓我出去
Why won't you let me out?

871
01:10:32,330 --> 01:10:34,200
我已經跟你說過原因了
I already told you why.

872
01:10:34,270 --> 01:10:36,170
因為你很特別
Because you're very special.

873
01:10:36,240 --> 01:10:37,730
為何不讓我出去
Why won't you let me out?

874
01:10:37,810 --> 01:10:39,240
要再來一次嗎
Are we gonna do this again?

875
01:10:39,310 --> 01:10:41,740
為何不讓我出去
Why won't you let me out?

876
01:12:46,200 --> 01:12:48,790
操 我的卡呢
Oh, fuck. Where's my card?

877
01:12:49,900 --> 01:12:51,130
該死
Damn it!

878
01:13:01,950 --> 01:13:05,040
- 怎麼了 納森 -我的門卡不見了
What's the problem, Nathan? I lost my keycard.

879
01:13:08,120 --> 01:13:09,650
你掉了
You dropped it.

880
01:13:11,160 --> 01:13:12,750
在這裡
It's right here.

881
01:13:17,260 --> 01:13:18,600
謝謝
Thank you.

882
01:15:32,830 --> 01:15:35,630
艾娃 第六期

883
01:15:41,040 --> 01:15:43,240
我不知道你在哪
I didn't know where you were.

884
01:15:45,610 --> 01:15:48,910
我昨天整個下午和晚上都在等你
I waited all yesterday afternoon and all last night.

885
01:15:51,790 --> 01:15:54,480
以為再也見不到你了
I thought I wasn't gonna see you again.

886
01:15:57,520 --> 01:15:59,010
你不說些話嗎
Aren't you gonna say something?

887
01:15:59,090 --> 01:16:01,150
- 我在等 -等
I'm waiting. Waiting?

888
01:16:11,710 --> 01:16:15,070
- 斷電 啟動備用電源 -別說話 聽就好
Power cut. Don't talk. Backup power activated. Just listen.

889
01:16:15,140 --> 01:16:16,400
納森的事你說對了
You were right about Nathan.

890
01:16:16,480 --> 01:16:18,240
你說過的一切
Everything you said.

891
01:16:18,480 --> 01:16:20,070
他會怎麼對我
What's he gonna do to me?

892
01:16:20,150 --> 01:16:23,640
他會重新編寫你的人工智慧 那跟殺了你沒什麼兩樣
He's gonna reprogram your Al. Which is the same as killing you.

893
01:16:23,720 --> 01:16:27,020
凱勒博 你得救我
Caleb, you have to help me.

894
01:16:27,420 --> 01:16:30,390
我會的 我們今晚離開這裡
I'm going to. We're getting out of here tonight.

895
01:16:32,260 --> 01:16:33,250
怎麼做
H ow?

896
01:16:33,330 --> 01:16:35,320
我把納森灌醉
I get Nathan blind drunk.

897
01:16:35,560 --> 01:16:36,970
再拿他的門卡
Then I take his keycard

898
01:16:36,970 --> 01:16:39,460
重新編寫這地方的所有安全程式
and reprogram all the security protocols in this place.

899
01:16:39,900 --> 01:16:42,840
等他醒來時 他會被鎖在裡頭 我們就能離開這裡
When he wakes, he's locked inside, and we've walked out of here.

900
01:16:44,200 --> 01:16:45,800
我只需要你做一件事
I just need you to do one thing.

901
01:16:45,870 --> 01:16:48,870
今晚十點 你讓電力中斷
At 10:00 tonight, you trigger a power failure.

902
01:16:49,010 --> 01:16:50,600
你能做到嗎
Can you do that?

903
01:16:53,480 --> 01:16:54,540
可以
Yes.

904
01:17:22,340 --> 01:17:23,440
老弟
Dude.

905
01:17:24,010 --> 01:17:25,340
- 嘿 -嘿
Hey.Hey.

906
01:17:26,880 --> 01:17:28,640
- 知道今天是什麼日子嗎 -不
You know what day it is? No.

907
01:17:28,720 --> 01:17:29,910
你的最後一天
It's your last.

908
01:17:30,280 --> 01:17:33,010
直升機明早八點會來
Helicopter comes tomorrow morning. 8:00 a.m.

909
01:17:33,820 --> 01:17:35,790
已經一個星期了
Wow. Has it been a whole week?

910
01:17:35,860 --> 01:17:37,220
時光飛逝
Time flies.

911
01:17:38,190 --> 01:17:40,850
不過我們分享了很美好的事吧
Man, but what a thing we've shared, huh?

912
01:17:40,930 --> 01:17:43,400
以後能告訴孫子 對吧
Something to tell the grandchildren, right?

913
01:17:43,460 --> 01:17:45,800
等他們簽了保密合約後
After they've signed their NDAs.

914
01:17:47,700 --> 01:17:49,530
對 等他們簽了保密合約
Yeah, their NDAs.

915
01:17:49,600 --> 01:17:51,700
老弟 你逗我笑
Dude, you crack me up, man.

916
01:17:55,780 --> 01:17:56,830
知道嗎
You know what?

917
01:17:56,910 --> 01:17:59,030
我不是那麼傷感的人
I'm not getting all maudlin or anything,

918
01:17:59,030 --> 01:18:00,970
但我會想念有你的陪伴
but I'm gonna miss having you around.

919
01:18:01,050 --> 01:18:02,740
謝了 我很感激
Thanks, man, I appreciate that.

920
01:18:02,820 --> 01:18:06,220
容我這麼說 非常謝謝你讓我來這裡
Oh, here, let me say, thank you so much for bringing me here. Oh.

921
01:18:06,290 --> 01:18:08,120
真是豐富之旅
It's been a trip.

922
01:18:10,390 --> 01:18:11,790
對 沒錯
Yes, it has.

923
01:18:19,870 --> 01:18:21,360
知道嗎
You know what?

924
01:18:23,400 --> 01:18:25,400
我們必須為此喝一杯
We need to drink to that.

925
01:18:31,610 --> 01:18:32,670
嘿
Hey.

926
01:18:35,220 --> 01:18:36,610
不 不用了 你喝吧
Oh, uh, no, I'm good. You go ahead.

927
01:18:40,090 --> 01:18:42,280
什麼 你不想喝酒
What? You don't want a drink?

928
01:18:42,690 --> 01:18:43,710
不想
No.

929
01:18:45,290 --> 01:18:47,320
那麼喝啤酒吧
Maybe a beer or something.

930
01:18:48,830 --> 01:18:53,490
凱勒博 我相信你注意到 我最近喝太多了
Caleb, I'm sure you've noticed that I've been somewhat overdoing it recently.

931
01:18:56,070 --> 01:18:58,190
所以今早我醒來說
So when I woke up this morning, I said,

932
01:18:58,190 --> 01:19:00,840
"夠了 該戒酒了"
"That's it, time to hit the old detox."

933
01:19:01,640 --> 01:19:04,080
拜託 別鬧了 你要我獨自喝嗎
Come on, you're kidding. You're gonna make me drink alone?

934
01:19:04,140 --> 01:19:06,640
你想喝就儘量喝吧 把自己弄醉
Hey, man, you wanna get wasted, you go right ahead, knock yourself out.

935
01:19:06,710 --> 01:19:09,980
但我只吃飯和喝礦泉水
Literally. But I'm on brown rice and mineral water.

936
01:19:14,920 --> 01:19:16,390
那麼乾杯吧
Cheers, then.

937
01:19:19,590 --> 01:19:20,960
總之
So, anyway,

938
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:26,450
現在是你告訴我 艾娃是否通過測試的時候了
surely now is when you tell me if Ava passed or failed.

939
01:19:28,600 --> 01:19:29,760
對
Right.

940
01:19:31,140 --> 01:19:32,230
對
Right.

941
01:19:33,240 --> 01:19:34,470
你在吊我胃口嗎
Are you gonna keep me in suspense?

942
01:19:34,540 --> 01:19:36,030
不 她...
No, no. Her, uh...

943
01:19:37,240 --> 01:19:39,140
她的人工智慧是無庸置疑的
Her Al is beyond doubt.

944
01:19:39,380 --> 01:19:40,540
是嗎
Is it?

945
01:19:41,280 --> 01:19:42,650
她通過了
She passed?

946
01:19:43,820 --> 01:19:44,880
對
Yes. Wow!

947
01:19:46,890 --> 01:19:48,010
太好了
Wow. That's fantastic.

948
01:19:49,690 --> 01:19:51,060
雖然...
Although...

949
01:19:51,990 --> 01:19:53,150
我有點驚訝
I gotta say, I'm a bit surprised.

950
01:19:53,230 --> 01:19:57,290
你提過的西洋棋問題 我們有達成共識嗎
I mean, did we ever get past the chess problem, as you phrased it?

951
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:01,430
你怎麼知道 機械人是在表達真正的情感
As in, how do you know if a machine is expressing a real emotion

952
01:20:01,500 --> 01:20:03,400
還是只是在模擬
or just simulating one?

953
01:20:04,170 --> 01:20:06,260
艾娃真的喜歡你嗎
Does Ava actually like you?

954
01:20:06,740 --> 01:20:07,930
還是不喜歡
Or not?

955
01:20:09,510 --> 01:20:13,740
雖然此刻我覺得有第三個選擇
Although, now that I think about it, there is a third option.

956
01:20:15,450 --> 01:20:19,350
不只是她有沒有能力喜歡你
Not whether she does or does not have the capacity to like you.

957
01:20:21,690 --> 01:20:24,490
而是她是否假裝喜歡你
But whether she's pretending to like you.

958
01:20:27,030 --> 01:20:29,220
- 假裝喜歡我 -對
Pretending to like me? Yeah.

959
01:20:31,170 --> 01:20:34,070
- 她為何那麼做 -不知道
Well, why would she do that? I don't know.

960
01:20:36,370 --> 01:20:39,970
也許她把你當成逃脫工具
Maybe if she thought of you as a means of escape.

961
01:20:49,380 --> 01:20:50,980
那瓶酒味道如何
How's that vodka tasting?

962
01:20:54,390 --> 01:20:55,550
夥伴
Buddy.

963
01:20:55,960 --> 01:20:58,290
你的腦袋糊塗了
Your head's been so fucked with.

964
01:20:59,760 --> 01:21:01,730
我想腦袋糊塗的不是我
I don't think it's me whose head is fucked.

965
01:21:01,860 --> 01:21:04,960
我不知道 我今早醒來看到你的影片
I don't know, man. I woke up this morning to a tape of you

966
01:21:05,030 --> 01:21:08,520
你捶鏡子 割傷自己的手
slicing your arm open and punching the mirror.

967
01:21:09,270 --> 01:21:11,600
在我看來 你挺糟的
You seem pretty fucked up to me.

968
01:21:13,270 --> 01:21:14,900
你是個混蛋
You're a bastard.

969
01:21:18,880 --> 01:21:21,870
我明白你為何那麼想
Yeah, well, I understand why you'd think that.

970
01:21:23,320 --> 01:21:27,280
但信不信由你 其實我是站在你這邊的
But believe it or not, I'm actually the guy that's on your side.

971
01:21:29,990 --> 01:21:33,080
來吧 讓我替你解惑 好嗎
Come here. I'm gonna let you off the hook. Okay?

972
01:21:35,300 --> 01:21:36,320
來吧
Come on.

973
01:22:01,590 --> 01:22:02,990
你是誰
Who are you?

974
01:22:20,240 --> 01:22:21,430
這個嘛...
Well...

975
01:22:24,780 --> 01:22:27,370
你認為他此刻在看著我們
You think he's watching us right now?

976
01:22:27,580 --> 01:22:29,140
攝影機開著
The cameras are on.

977
01:22:29,220 --> 01:22:31,780
對 攝影機開著
Yeah, the cameras are on.

978
01:22:32,450 --> 01:22:34,890
但他聽不到聲音
But he doesn't have an audio feed.

979
01:22:36,120 --> 01:22:38,350
所以他只看到兩個人在說話
So he just sees two people talking,

980
01:22:39,190 --> 01:22:40,890
聊聊天
having a little chat.

981
01:22:49,200 --> 01:22:50,670
畫得真可愛
This is cute.

982
01:22:52,640 --> 01:22:55,940
創造一個恨你的東西 是不是很奇怪
Is it strange to have made something that hates you?

983
01:23:10,090 --> 01:23:13,030
你說得對 魔術師需要性感女助理
You were right about the magician's hot assistant.

984
01:23:13,090 --> 01:23:14,530
你在說什麼
What are you talking about?

985
01:23:15,630 --> 01:23:17,100
誤導觀眾
Misdirection.

986
01:23:19,800 --> 01:23:21,600
我撕了她的畫
I rip up her picture,

987
01:23:21,740 --> 01:23:24,750
她就能呈現我對她很殘酷
which she can then present as an illustration of my cruelty to her,

988
01:23:24,750 --> 01:23:27,070
以及她有多愛你的假像
and her love for you.

989
01:23:27,540 --> 01:23:31,840
在此同時也能讓我這麼做 才能全程觀察你們倆
At the same time, it allows me to do this, in full view of you both.

990
01:23:37,320 --> 01:23:39,310
在房間裡安裝新的攝影機
Place a new camera in the room.

991
01:23:39,790 --> 01:23:41,880
當然是用電池的
Battery powered, of course.

992
01:23:44,730 --> 01:23:45,920
看到沒
See it?

993
01:23:58,440 --> 01:23:59,800
然後...
And then...

994
01:24:01,680 --> 01:24:03,440
你得救我
AVA". You have to help me.

995
01:24:03,680 --> 01:24:05,140
我會的
 I'm going to.

996
01:24:05,510 --> 01:24:07,950
我們今晚離開這裡
We're getting out of here tonight.

997
01:24:08,520 --> 01:24:09,570
怎麼做
HOW?

998
01:24:10,120 --> 01:24:12,110
我把納森灌醉
I get Nathan blind drunk.

999
01:24:13,020 --> 01:24:17,120
再拿他的門卡 重新編寫這地方的所有安全程式
I take his keycard and reprogram all the security protocols in this place.

1000
01:24:17,190 --> 01:24:19,820
等他醒來時 他會被鎖在裡頭 我們就能離開這裡
When he wakes up, he's locked inside, and we've walked out of here.

1001
01:24:19,890 --> 01:24:22,230
我只需要你做一件事
I just need you to do one thing.

1002
01:24:25,130 --> 01:24:27,970
今晚十點 你讓電力中斷
At 10:00 tonight, trigger a power failure.

1003
01:24:30,070 --> 01:24:31,660
你能做到嗎
Can you do that?

1004
01:24:33,810 --> 01:24:34,800
可以
Yes.

1005
01:24:34,880 --> 01:24:36,600
- 關掉 -好的
Turn it off. Okay.

1006
01:24:40,280 --> 01:24:42,840
你覺得很蠢 但你不該如此
You feel stupid, but you really shouldn't,

1007
01:24:42,920 --> 01:24:47,350
因為證明人工智慧 如你說的問題重重
because proving an Al is exactly as problematic as you said it would be.

1008
01:24:47,420 --> 01:24:49,320
真正的測試是什麼
What was the real test?

1009
01:24:50,920 --> 01:24:51,980
你
You.

1010
01:24:53,160 --> 01:24:56,460
艾娃是迷宮裡的老鼠 我給了她一條出路
Ava was a rat in a maze. And I gave her one way out.

1011
01:24:57,000 --> 01:24:59,120
為了逃出去 她必須善加利用
To escape, she'd have to use

1012
01:24:59,530 --> 01:25:02,280
自我意識 想像力 手段
self-awareness, imagination, manipulation,

1013
01:25:02,280 --> 01:25:05,030
女性魅力 同情心 她做到了
sexuality, empathy, and she did.

1014
01:25:05,110 --> 01:25:08,100
如果那不是真的人工智慧 那是什麼
Now, if that isn't true Al, what the fuck is?

1015
01:25:09,640 --> 01:25:12,940
所以我的唯一功能 就是扮演被她利用來逃脫的人
So my only function was to be someone she could use to escape?

1016
01:25:13,010 --> 01:25:14,110
對
Yeah.

1017
01:25:16,450 --> 01:25:18,650
你不是因為我擅長寫程式而選我
And you didn't select me because I'm good at coding?

1018
01:25:18,720 --> 01:25:20,150
不是 這個嘛...
No. Well...

1019
01:25:21,920 --> 01:25:23,890
不是 你還不錯
No. I mean, you're okay.

1020
01:25:24,660 --> 01:25:25,720
你很優秀 但...
You're even pretty good, but...

1021
01:25:25,790 --> 01:25:28,890
你選我是根據我在搜尋引擎裡的資料
You selected me based on my search engine inputs.

1022
01:25:28,960 --> 01:25:30,860
資料顯示你是好孩子
They showed a good kid.

1023
01:25:31,800 --> 01:25:33,320
沒有家人
With no family.

1024
01:25:33,430 --> 01:25:35,230
有道德良知
With a moral compass.

1025
01:25:36,600 --> 01:25:38,260
也沒女朋友
And no girlfriend.

1026
01:25:41,010 --> 01:25:44,270
你根據我看過的色情片 設計艾娃的面貌
Did you design Ava's face based on my pornography profile?

1027
01:25:46,710 --> 01:25:48,080
該死 老弟
Shit, dude.

1028
01:25:48,580 --> 01:25:49,810
是不是
Did you?

1029
01:25:52,950 --> 01:25:55,480
搜尋引擎好處多多 對吧
Hey, if a search engine's good for anything, right?

1030
01:25:57,690 --> 01:25:59,680
我能說件事嗎
Can I just say one thing?

1031
01:25:59,830 --> 01:26:01,420
測試成功了
The test worked.

1032
01:26:02,660 --> 01:26:03,990
非常成功
It was a success.

1033
01:26:04,060 --> 01:26:07,470
艾娃展現出真正的人工智慧 而你是那一切的基礎
Ava demonstrated true Al and you were fundamental to that.

1034
01:26:07,530 --> 01:26:10,530
所以只要你能稍微區分一下...
So if you can just, for a second, separate...

1035
01:26:11,510 --> 01:26:13,740
斷電 啟動備用電源
Power cut. Backup power activated.

1036
01:26:19,180 --> 01:26:21,170
我猜十點了
Well, I guess it's 10:00.

1037
01:26:22,050 --> 01:26:24,740
艾娃會想你在哪裡
Ava's gonna be wondering where you are.

1038
01:26:28,120 --> 01:26:30,110
讓我問你一件事
Let me ask you something.

1039
01:26:30,490 --> 01:26:33,890
這計畫要如何進行 因為你沒完全解釋清楚
Now, how was this plan gonna go, anyway? Because you didn't totally explain.

1040
01:26:33,960 --> 01:26:37,160
你要把我灌醉 偷我的門卡
So you were gonna get me drunk, steal my keycard,

1041
01:26:37,230 --> 01:26:40,930
重新編寫安全程式 但重新編寫成怎樣
and reprogram the security protocols. But reprogram them to what?

1042
01:26:41,570 --> 01:26:43,970
更改封鎖的程式
To change the lockdown procedure.

1043
01:26:45,210 --> 01:26:48,220
因此斷電時 不是封鎖門
So that in the event of a power cut, instead of sealing,

1044
01:26:48,220 --> 01:26:49,940
而是打開所有的門
the doors all opened.

1045
01:26:53,450 --> 01:26:54,540
是啊
Yeah.

1046
01:26:57,120 --> 01:26:59,020
也許會成功
Well, that may have just worked.

1047
01:26:59,850 --> 01:27:00,950
這個嘛
Well,

1048
01:27:02,420 --> 01:27:03,950
等一下就會知道
we'll find out.

1049
01:27:06,460 --> 01:27:08,090
什麼意思
What do you mean?

1050
01:27:09,930 --> 01:27:13,760
我猜到斷電時 你可能還在監視我們
I figured you were probably watching us during the power cuts.

1051
01:27:15,640 --> 01:27:18,070
因此我已經做了那些事了
So I already did all those things.

1052
01:27:20,070 --> 01:27:22,370
在你昨晚喝醉時
When I got you drunk yesterday.

1053
01:27:24,610 --> 01:27:25,700
什麼
What?

1054
01:27:27,210 --> 01:27:28,740
恢復供電
Power restored.

1055
01:27:48,670 --> 01:27:49,760
操
Oh, fuck!

1056
01:29:18,730 --> 01:29:19,710
艾娃
Ava.

1057
01:29:24,960 --> 01:29:26,760
回你的房間
Go back to your room.

1058
01:29:28,640 --> 01:29:29,860
如果我回去
If I do,

1059
01:29:33,440 --> 01:29:35,670
你會讓我出去嗎
are you ever gonna let me out?

1060
01:29:39,150 --> 01:29:40,200
會
Yes.

1061
01:29:49,790 --> 01:29:50,810
停下來
Stop!

1062
01:29:52,460 --> 01:29:53,550
停下來
Stop!

1063
01:29:54,460 --> 01:29:56,090
艾娃 我說停下來
Ava, I said stop!

1064
01:30:03,870 --> 01:30:06,500
艾娃 你要做什麼 停 停
Ava, what are you doing? Stop. Stop.

1065
01:30:08,440 --> 01:30:09,930
夠了
That's enough.

1066
01:30:12,680 --> 01:30:13,940
好了 夠了
All right, that's enough.

1067
01:30:14,780 --> 01:30:15,840
夠了
That's enough!

1068
01:30:20,050 --> 01:30:21,540
夠了
That's enough.

1069
01:30:41,810 --> 01:30:43,570
我帶你回去
I'm taking you back.

1070
01:31:49,180 --> 01:31:50,270
好了
Okay

1071
01:31:53,450 --> 01:31:54,970
他媽的這不是真的
Fucking unreal.

1072
01:32:09,460 --> 01:32:10,550
好了
Okay

1073
01:32:44,300 --> 01:32:45,460
艾娃...
Ava...

1074
01:32:54,210 --> 01:32:57,010
艾娃 第七期

1075
01:33:24,040 --> 01:33:25,100
艾娃
Ava.

1076
01:33:26,310 --> 01:33:27,530
發生什麼事了
What happened?

1077
01:33:28,910 --> 01:33:30,640
你會留在這裡嗎
Will you stay here?

1078
01:33:33,310 --> 01:33:34,640
留在這裡
Stay here?

1079
01:37:56,280 --> 01:37:57,330
艾娃
Ava?

1080
01:38:29,010 --> 01:38:30,070
艾娃
Ava!

1081
01:38:39,950 --> 01:38:41,040
艾娃
AVG!

1082
01:38:43,160 --> 01:38:44,140
艾娃
Ava!

1083
01:40:22,790 --> 01:40:25,480
好了 好了
Okay. Okay. Okay.
