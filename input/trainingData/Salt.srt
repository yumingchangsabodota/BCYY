Returned to his home. But the man who came home to America, was in fact a Russian spy.

136
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,480
他叫埃里克

137
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:24,920
1963年十一月22日
On November 22, 1963

138
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:29,240
埃里克完成了三个新计划的第一个

139
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:32,160
而成为了苏维埃的英雄
And a hero in the Soviet Union.

140
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:38,640
于是间谍主管得到而来一个机会，去创造更多像埃里克那样的人。
The spy master was now given the go ahead, to create many more like Alec.

141
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,080
秘密特工组织
Scores of agents.

142
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:42,840
有男有女
Males and females

143
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:45,400
把他们安置在美国
To be substituted for Americans.

144
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:57,360
在一个废弃的学校里，他们在学习俄语之前就学习英语
In an abandoned monestery they were learning English before they were learning Russian.

145
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:59,320
了解美国的风俗习惯
Drilled in idiom, idiosynchrocy

146
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:02,680


147
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:04,400


148
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:10,360
在接受的严格的精神和体能训练之后

149
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:13,240
间谍主管创造出了钢铁战士

150
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:17,040
不可置疑，不可动摇
Unquestioned and unbreakable.

151
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:19,000
这故事就要弄死我了，老兄
You're killing me, man.

152
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,360
什么时候能讲到仙女出现？
When does the good fairy come in?

153
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:23,600
永远没有
No, never...

154
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:26,160
这是个绝望的故事
It's a story without hope.

155
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:30,920
楔考夫的情况符合一个美国家庭的女孩
Chankov had matched a girl to an American family

156
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:37,240
发生而来事故，父母都死了
There was an accident, the family died. 

157
00:12:37,241 --> 00:12:38,241
所以偰考夫被送往美国
So Chankov was sent to America.

158
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:40,680
过着一种完全被谎言覆盖的生活……
To live a complete lie...

159
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:46,360
而且知道现在都一直在等待有一天能开始从内部攻击，dayx
And to patiently await the day to attack from within, day X.

160
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:51,000
那个长期任务就在这，
The long awaited mission is here.

161
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:59,360
偰考夫会到达你的城市，杀掉俄国总统
Chankov will travel to your city to kill the President of Russia.

162

那是个乡野传说
It's an urban legend.

165
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:18,120
潜伏的俄国特工潜入美国本土进行暗杀和破坏活动
Russian sleeper agents inserted into American society to carry out sabotage and assassinations

166
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,720
没有可能他们一等数年就为了那终极一击
Most likely they are waiting years to do a knock-

167
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:23,800
很有可能……
Seemingly

168
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:26,120
什么？ 你不相信有刺客这一说？
What? You don't believe in moles?

169
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:29,000
我相信高手刺客，但我不相信有超人
I believe in moles, just not the boogey man.

170
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:31,960
尤其是他们的任务还是刺杀自己的总统
Specially if the plan is to kill their own president.

171
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:33,560
这个家伙在放烟雾弹
This guy's selling smoke.

172
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,240
手工，伊娃
Wrap it up, Eve.

173
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:40,640
所以说这有一个俄国特工要去杀俄国总统
So a Russian agent is gonna kill the Russain president. Right?

174
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:43,680

185
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:28,240
那么就是那个俄国特工
Then you are a Russian spy.

186
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:30,560
他说的是真话

No, no, not after the neuro-scan.

I can beat that thing five times out of six. I'm trained and so is he.

There is a reason he mentioned my wedding ring Ted.

196
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:12,360
但他们暴露一个间谍，他们就会全都暴露你知道的。
When they blow up a spy, they blow up their whole covered life and you know that.

197
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:14,440

你想让我开枪打他么？

找到她

277

打开那该死的摄像机

麦克一个小时前离开而了办公室
Michael Krauss left his office an hour ago.

00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:45,320
邵特的家离这里20分钟路程
Salt's apartment is 20 minutes from here.

283
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,480
我们可以包围那个地方，但他不会回去的
We can cover it, but she won't go there.

284
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:49,240
如果他真的关心她丈夫他就会去的

He is one of the world's top arachnologists, Eve.

290

你在干什么
What are you doing?

307
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:05,000
她不在这，她丈夫也不见踪影
She's not here and no sign of the husband either.

308
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,360
你就从没想过那个俄国人可能在撒谎么
Did it ever occur to you that maybe that Russian was lying?

309
00:28:07,361 --> 00:28:08,361
那她为什么跑
Why'd she run?

310
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:10,440
我不知道，因为那要把她关起来
I don't know, cause you were gonna lock her up? -

311
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:13,280
从她的角度看看，也许他的丈夫真的身处险境
See it from her perpective. Maybe her husband is some real danger.

312
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:16,120
也许，看在上帝的份上，邵特是清白的
Maybe, God forbid, Salt is who she says she is.

313
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:20,440
也许对你来说是，但我的任务就是抓到她 然后问清楚
Maybe is your department. Mine is catching her so we can find out.

Protocol is clear: we bring her in, we bring her down.

315
00:28:24,272 --> 00:28:25,634
你对这个女人的身份有什么见解么
Do you have any idea who this woman is?

316
00:28:26,629 --> 00:28:28,711
那些她为这个国家所做的一切，这些对你来说就没有一点意义？
What she's done for this country. Does that mean anything to you?

317
00:28:29,490 --> 00:28:30,266
有么？

抓住她
Got her.

她正向北面跑向地铁站

She was with her parents in 1988 in a car accident when they died,

They were teachers at the American Embassy for the children of the staff there.

That's why we put her on Russia in the first place.

安全
All clear.

552
01:04:06,560 --> 01:04:07,680
请进先生

553
01:04:11,960 --> 01:04:13,320
转身
Turn around.

554
01:04:16,280 --> 01:04:18,120
Thank you.

555
01:04:24,280 --> 01:04:28,520
耐心最重要，我们来到这里已经两年了，其他人更久
Patience is key, I've been coming here for two years. Others have been coming here even longer.

556
01:04:28,560 --> 01:04:30,880
其他人，——我不知道——
What others? - Don't know. -

557
01:04:30,880 --> 01:04:32,320
你是我们中最强的
You were the best of us.

558
01:04:32,320 --> 01:04:33,560
而我是最弱的
And I was the least.

559
01:04:34,040 --> 01:04:37,240
所以必须由其他人来完成我们未尽的事业
There must be others to finish what we begin.

560
01:04:44,840 --> 01:04:47,600
泰德，你的那个俄国秘密特工邵特
Ted, your Russion CI agent Salt...

561
01:04:48,080 --> 01:04:49,360
对于她 你有什么可以告诉我们的
What can you tell us about her?

562
01:04:49,400 --> 01:04:51,480
我们认为他可能是个苏维埃间谍
We think she might be a Sovjet plant.

563
01:04:52,200 --> 01:04:55,080
潜伏多年为了一个什么KGB计划
Inserted several years for what the KGB 

564
01:04:55,080 --> 01:04:56,880
那一天就叫做“day X”
called "Day X".

565
01:04:56,880 --> 01:05:00,280
那一天就是标志着美国和他的盟友将受到致命威胁的一天
A day that would mark the start of a large-scale strike against the US and her allies.

566
01:05:07,880 --> 01:05:10,040
你就是总统了
That should the be President now.

567
01:05:12,840 --> 01:05:16,440
你有一项艰巨的任务要完成，但你会做到的
You have a big job, but you can do it.

568
01:05:17,080 --> 01:05:20,280
你还是没有告诉我你的任务是什么。——回家——
You still haven't told me what your job is. - Home. -

569
01:05:21,240 --> 01:05:22,520
我就要回家了
I'm going home.

570
01:05:46,080 --> 01:05:47,720
你还要么，长官？——是的——
Are you okay, sir? - Yes -

571
01:06:07,960 --> 01:06:08,960
我想我看见他了
I think I saw her.

572
01:06:10,040 --> 01:06:11,160

Who?

573
01:06:13,360 --> 01:06:14,480
邵特

574
01:06:14,960 --> 01:06:17,360
我在楼梯上看见他了
I think I saw her in the corridor.

575
01:06:19,840 --> 01:06:21,080


576
01:06:24,480 --> 01:06:26,000
他在那
She's here.

577
01:06:28,240 --> 01:06:29,200
安全。
Clear. Move.

578
01:06:30,560 --> 01:06:31,520
Go.

579
01:06:31,520 --> 01:06:34,240
我们在这里能看见
We may have a visual on the second assaillant. Evelyn Salt.

580
01:06:37,960 --> 01:06:41,760
这不是演习
<i><b>THIS IS NOT A DRILL. EVACUATE.</b></i>

581
01:06:45,560 --> 01:06:47,080
这不是演习
<i><b>THIS IS NOT A DRILL</b></i>

582
01:06:47,840 --> 01:06:49,720
我们需要从这里到左边都安全
I need the hallway cleared to the left, now

583
01:06:51,640 --> 01:06:53,920
我们现在需要去地堡
This is Jenkins. I need the bunker up and running.

584
01:06:53,920 --> 01:06:57,720


585
01:06:57,720 --> 01:06:59,240
如果这是俄国政府的报复行为，那它就是战争挑衅
If this was sanctioned by the Russian Government, it is an act of war.

586
01:07:06,480 --> 01:07:07,920
我们走吧，先生
Let's go, Sir,

587

关闭
Close it.

590
01:08:12,320 --> 01:08:13,200
明白
Clear.

591
01:08:22,440 --> 01:08:25,800
她可能跟来么？-一旦门被关闭就没人能进来
Any chance she could follow? - No one can get through that door once it's closed. -

592
01:08:25,840 --> 01:08:26,640
OK

593
01:08:26,640 --> 01:08:28,400
很不幸，她和你们不太一样
Unfortunately, she isn't one of your's.

594
01:08:33,240 --> 01:08:33,880
OK, go.

595
01:08:35,200 --> 01:08:36,680
大家跟紧，关闭闸门
Stay close. Shut the seal.

596
01:09:12,720 --> 01:09:18,400
先生，我们必须假设今天就是“day x”的开始
Sir, we must discuss the probability that today is the beginning of "Day X".

597
01:09:19,560 --> 01:09:21,760
总统先生，medford 在线上
Mr. President, director Medford is up.

598
01:09:22,640 --> 01:09:24,080
现在是什么情况
Marianne, what is the situation?

599
01:09:24,080 --> 01:09:26,640
你该看看你的屏幕
It should be coming up on your screen.

600
01:09:27,440 --> 01:09:32,560
你在这里看到的是在西伯利亚的异常散热源
What you see here is a scanning thermal regions in Siberia.

601
01:09:32,560 --> 01:09:36,040
这表明俄国已经开始准备他们的导弹系统
Means that the Russians are deplowying their missiles to the field.

602
01:09:36,080 --> 01:09:38,720
这个消息已经得到了地面确认
And this information is confirmed on the ground.

603
01:09:40,720 --> 01:09:44,040
先生，我强烈建议我们从四级预警转到二级
Sir, I strongly recommend we go tO DEFCON 2.

604
01:09:44,480 --> 01:09:45,720
这是最基本的
At least on a basis.

605
01:09:49,960 --> 01:09:55,320
介于俄国已经开始了导弹防御，我们也必须做好准备了
Considering the Russians are deploying, we must look at our own nuclear attack options.

606
01:09:55,680 --> 01:09:58,320
这不是警告也不是威胁
It's not on table and it's not a deterrent.

607
01:10:25,320 --> 01:10:29,120
我们的外门卡住了，而且没有反应
The outer door is jammed and non-responsive.

608
01:10:29,200 --> 01:10:32,200
我们也失去了外面大部分监控录像的信号
We just lost the feed with most of our security camera's.

609
01:10:32,200 --> 01:10:34,880
我们什么也看不见了，而且每人能进来
We are blind down here and no one can enter this place.

610
01:10:34,920 --> 01:10:39,320
指挥官，我们的监控失效了，而且这里有一个POC安全系统故障
Command, our eyes are down and we have a POC security system

611
01:10:39,360 --> 01:10:40,200
从这走，现在
Get out there, now.

612
01:10:41,200 --> 01:10:41,960
关闭这件屋子
Seal this room.

613
01:10:44,560 --> 01:10:46,360
到下面的走廊里去，注意戒备
Down that corridor, secure it.

614
01:11:37,760 --> 01:11:41,200
我是总统，要求通过安全指令
Mr. President Howard Lewis, proceed with authentication.

615
01:11:41,200 --> 01:11:42,440
是，先生

密码核实完毕
Authentication is confirmed.

618
01:12:02,680 --> 01:12:04,160
现在都有您决定了，总统先生
It's all yours now, Mr. President.

619
01:12:04,920 --> 01:12:05,920
上帝与你同在。
God be with you.

620
01:12:08,640 --> 01:12:11,160
目标现在在您的控制之下，总统先生
Targets are under your control, Mr. President,

621
01:12:18,120 --> 01:12:19,840
门外的监控能用么？ ——是的——
Does the camera outside the door work? - Yes -

622
01:12:19,840 --> 01:12:20,440
让我看看

623
01:12:30,760 --> 01:12:31,840
那是谁？
Who is that?

624
01:12:33,040 --> 01:12:34,160
是她  
It's her.

625
01:12:34,560 --> 01:12:36,080
是伊芙琳*邵特
That's Evelyne Salt.

626
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:43,000
把你的武器给我，——不行，我是这里唯一可以拿武器的保安人员——
Give me your side-arm - No, that's only for Secret Service. -

627
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:45,000
去他的安全条例，我们有个敌特在外面
Screw Protocol James. we have an enemy agent out there.-

628
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:46,000
规定就是规定，先生
Protocol is protocol Sir.

629
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:48,960
你死了，就是死了
You're dead - is dead -

630
01:12:53,440 --> 01:12:54,840
我是国土安全顾问
I'm the National Security Advisor.

631
01:12:55,960 --> 01:12:56,960
不再是了
Not anymore.

你是谁？
Who are you?

635

我的名字，总统先生是，尼克列*特瓦斯科
My name, Mr. President is Nicolai Tarkovsky.

636
01:13:13,880 --> 01:13:18,920
除非你按我说的做，否则我将是你见到的最后一个人
And unless you do exactly what I say, I will be the last person you will ever see.

637
01:13:24,960 --> 01:13:26,960
让我们看看都有哪些目标可打
Let's have a look at some attack options.

638
01:13:27,320 --> 01:13:28,200

你为什么没告诉我你是我们中的一员
Why didn't you tell me?

643
01:14:13,680 --> 01:14:15,920
我试过

01:14:16,280 --> 01:14:19,280
没成功

645
01:14:19,360 --> 01:14:21,720
但如果你在俄国和我们在一起，我应该认出你
But if you're with us in Russia I would've remembered you.

646
01:14:21,720 --> 01:14:24,120

<i><b>We can see the president and is at the airport after his release from hospital</b></i>

665
01:16:24,400 --> 01:16:27,320
他的医生说这真是个奇迹
This is a miracle according to his doctors.

666
01:16:27,400 --> 01:16:34,280
他说总统的假死是由一种毒蜘蛛的毒液导致的
The President's temporary death was attributed to Amotaliyn, a spider venom.

我们害怕我们会在北朝鲜失去你
I feared we may have lost there in Korea.

01:16:53,560 --> 01:16:57,280
你应该把那个男人收纳到我们的组织里来，而不是爱上他
You were supposed to recruit the man, not fall in love with him.

670
01:16:58,720 --> 01:17:01,080
这就是为什么我让奥利弗抓了他
That's why I told Orlov to pick him up.

如果你需要一个人来怨
And you need a person to take the blame.

01:20:47,640 --> 01:20:51,800
总统先生，先生，你能听见我说话么
Mr. President, Mr. President, can you hear me?

693
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:06,600
我要她被隔离在一个单独的房间，如果这里还有其他俄共，我不希望他们交谈
I want her alone in a room. If there are other KA's I don't want them talking.

694
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:10,280
她受过训练，如果她不想说，我们无论如何都不能让她开口
She's trained not to talk, no matter what we do to her.

695
01:21:10,680 --> 01:21:12,960
如果我们要找到那些家活，我们只能靠我们自己了
If we find these people must find them ourselves.

696
01:21:12,960 --> 01:21:14,040
有些人已经在这么做了
Somebody already did. 

697
01:21:14,120 --> 01:21:18,640
至少是他们中的一部分，——在东边的河岸，12具尸体，包括奥利弗——
At least some of them - in the East River. 12 dead, including Orlov.

698
01:21:18,640 --> 01:21:20,480
谁干的
Who did that?

699
01:21:22,200 --> 01:21:24,120
不知道，法医正在那边
I don't know. Forensics are on it.

700
01:21:33,400 --> 01:21:34,840
请退后
Step back sir, please.

701
01:21:34,840 --> 01:21:36,560
请退后
Please step back.

702
01:22:14,520 --> 01:22:16,840
她攻击了温特，长官，你最好来一下
She attacked Winter sir. You'd better come up here.

703
01:22:54,480 --> 01:22:56,200
坐下
Sit down.

704
01:22:57,400 --> 01:23:00,400
在飞行期间的15分钟她是你的
She's yours for 15 minutes during this flight.

705
01:23:47,200 --> 01:23:48,720
你为什么杀他？
Why'd you kill him?

706
01:23:49,720 --> 01:23:51,240
总得有人干这个
Because somebody had to.

707
01:24:04,120 --> 01:24:05,160
什么？
What?

708
01:24:15,480 --> 01:24:18,960
你真的相信人们说他们是谁就是谁？
Do you think that everyone is who they say they are?

709
01:24:19,720 --> 01:24:22,160
你知道奥利弗过来卖情报事有蹊跷
ou knew that something was wrong when Orlov walked in.

710
01:24:22,320 --> 01:24:23,280
我也是
So did I.

711
01:24:23,720 --> 01:24:25,160
你只是不知道问题出在哪
We just didn't know what it was.

712
01:24:26,480 --> 01:24:27,560
泰德*温特知道
Winter did.

713
01:24:27,920 --> 01:24:28,600
温特？
Winter?

714
01:24:30,600 --> 01:24:35,600
你希望我相信你是温特要发射导弹，而你救了全世界？
You expect me to believe that Winter was gonna launch the nukes and you save the world?

715
01:24:37,680 --> 01:24:39,440
我现在正是希望你这么做
I would like you to believe that yes.

716
01:24:42,040 --> 01:24:43,440
这可是个非常严重的指控
It's a big accusation.

717
01:24:44,520 --> 01:24:45,480
哦
Wow.

718
01:24:46,960 --> 01:24:49,480
他现在死了，所以也没可能为自己辩护
He's dead now so he can't defend himself.

719
01:24:49,560 --> 01:24:52,560
所以我猜你现在的自己做判断了
I guess you'll have to decide for yourself.

720
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:01,320
像你这样的在这里还有几个
How many more like you are there?

721
01:25:02,280 --> 01:25:03,360
向我这样的？
Like me?

722
01:25:04,520 --> 01:25:06,400
没有了
none

723
01:25:06,920 --> 01:25:08,200
但，像他那样的
Like him?

724
01:25:08,640 --> 01:25:10,600
比你能想象的还多
More than you can imagine

725
01:25:13,800 --> 01:25:20,480
你真的相信一个训练有素的特工在那么近的地方还杀不了总统么？
Do you think that a trained agent will not be able to kill the President of Russia from a reasonable distance if she wanted to?

726
01:25:24,840 --> 01:25:26,840
同理，还有你
Or you, for that matter.

727
01:25:27,320 --> 01:25:29,520
我本可以杀你，但我没有
I could've killed you at the funeral but I didn't.

728
01:25:29,640 --> 01:25:32,760
你向我投降是因为，我让你别无选择
You surrendered to me because you knew you had no choice.

729
01:25:32,760 --> 01:25:34,080
你比谁都清楚
You know better.

730
01:25:35,480 --> 01:25:36,960
我有选择
I had a choice.

731
01:25:38,280 --> 01:25:39,520
你比谁都清楚
You know better.

732
01:25:47,320 --> 01:25:51,880
<i><b> </b></i>

733
01:26:02,360 --> 01:26:05,280
如果我相信你，我没说我相信，我只是说如果我相信你
I don't believe you.

734
01:26:06,600 --> 01:26:07,920
那也只有我，没有人回信的
But if I did, no else would.

735
01:26:09,960 --> 01:26:12,360
那么，也许你可以帮我想想办法
Maybe you can think of a way around that.

736
01:26:12,361 --> 01:26:13,361
 

737
01:26:23,640 --> 01:26:25,920
他们从我这里夺走了一切
They took everything from me.

738
01:26:27,560 --> 01:26:29,000
我会把他们全都杀光
I'll kill them all.

739
01:26:51,720 --> 01:26:53,160
胡扯！
Bullshit!

740
01:27:13,440 --> 01:27:14,400
去干掉他们
Go get 'em.

741
01:27:20,160 --> 01:28:30,840
