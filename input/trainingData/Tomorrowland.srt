你能不要打断吗?
Could you please just stop interrupting?

23
00:01:46,664 --> 00:01:48,752
可以 但你说点积极的吧

30
00:02:02,110 --> 00:02:04,767
不先说明白这些 我没法接着说
I can't tell them anything until I tell them about this.

31
00:02:04,792 --> 00:02:06,980
我们就不能从别的开始说吗?
Can we please just start somewhere else?

32
00:02:07,005 --> 00:02:09,355

好吧 我小时候
Alright. Well, when I was a kid

38

先生 您好
Hello, sir.

45
00:03:25,269 --> 00:03:28,507
- 有什么能帮您的吗?  - 我叫约翰·弗朗西斯·沃克
- May I help you?  - My name is John Francis Walker.

46
00:03:28,532 --> 00:03:31,733
- 我是来赢那五十美元奖金的  - 是么
- I'm here to win $50.  - Is that so.

47
00:03:32,419 --> 00:03:35,019
因为有氮气燃料舱 我就把它拆开带来了
I took it apart because of the nitrogen compartment.

48
00:03:35,044 --> 00:03:39,830
汽车有点颠簸 你知道 亚硝基那么易燃
Seeing as how the bus ride was kinda bumpy, and, you know nitro.

49
00:03:40,636 --> 00:03:43,512
其实我也可以用过氧化氢做燃料
I could have used a hydrogen peroxide-powered engine,

50
00:03:43,514 --> 00:03:45,609
然后通过火箭背带解除连接
while lapses of that with their rocket belt,

51
00:03:45,634 --> 00:03:47,239
但我想在可行性和耐力上
and I guess there were some issues

52
00:03:47,264 --> 00:03:50,771
还是存在一些问题的
with maneuverability and flight duration and stuff.

53
00:03:51,471 --> 00:03:53,414
这是喷气背包
It's a jet pack.

54
00:03:53,999 --> 00:03:55,397
看出来了吧
Obviously.

55
00:03:55,422 --> 00:03:57,633
你自己做的吗?
You made this yourself?

56
00:04:01,792 --> 00:04:04,494
雅典娜 你怎么来了?
Athena, what are you doing here?

57
00:04:06,565 --> 00:04:09,229
是 还是不是?
Did you? Or didn't you?

58
00:04:09,254 --> 00:04:11,232
额 我...
Uh. I...

59
00:04:11,732 --> 00:04:14,936
- 什么意思?  - 这是你自己做的吗?
- What?  - Did you make this yourself?

60
00:04:15,327 --> 00:04:16,647
是的
Yeah.

61
00:04:16,672 --> 00:04:18,442
为什么?
Why?

62
00:04:18,607 --> 00:04:24,646
我想 我厌倦了等别人来替我做这些事情了
I guess I got tired of waiting around for someone else to do it for me.

63
00:04:27,305 --> 00:04:29,374
它能用吗?
Does it work?

64
00:04:30,818 --> 00:04:33,748
额... 当然
Um... sure. Yeah.

65
00:04:39,572 --> 00:04:41,372
大多数情况下
Mostly.

66
00:04:44,352 --> 00:04:48,689
只是从技术角度来说 它不是...
It just doesn't really, you know, technically...

67
00:05:01,952 --> 00:05:03,701
在飞
fly.

68
00:05:05,877 --> 00:05:08,372
如果从技术上说它能飞的话
But if it did, you know, technically fly,

69
00:05:08,397 --> 00:05:10,240
这东西有什么用处?
what would it's purpose be?

70
00:05:10,265 --> 00:05:13,023
你的喷气背包如何能让世界变得更好?
How would your jet pack make the world a better place?

71
00:05:13,048 --> 00:05:14,216
增添了乐趣 不行吗?
Can't it just be fun?

72
00:05:14,241 --> 00:05:18,300
沃克先生 不要告诉我你只知道乐趣
Mr. Walker, please tell me you can do better than 'fun'.

73
00:05:18,325 --> 00:05:20,642
它让一切皆有可能
Anything is possible.

74
00:05:20,667 --> 00:05:22,188
我不懂这什么意思
I don't know what that means.

75
00:05:22,213 --> 00:05:26,486
如果我走在街上 看到一个孩子背着喷气背包飞过
If I was walking down the street and I saw some kid with a jet pack fly over me,

76
00:05:26,511 --> 00:05:28,507
我会相信一切皆有可能
I'd believe anything's possible.

77
00:05:28,532 --> 00:05:29,968
我会被激励
I'd be inspired.

78
00:05:29,993 --> 00:05:32,531
这算不算让世界变得更好?
Doesn't that make the world a better place?

79
00:05:33,864 --> 00:05:35,785
算是吧
I suppose it would.

80
00:05:37,146 --> 00:05:39,533
前提是它好用
If, it worked.

81
00:05:39,558 --> 00:05:42,777
但不幸的是 它不好用
Unfortunately, it does not.

82
00:05:43,161 --> 00:05:45,763
如果它不好用 那一切都白搭
And if it doesn't work, it has no purpose at all.

83
00:05:45,788 --> 00:05:47,292
谢谢你能来 沃克先生
Thank you for your time, Mr. Walker.

84
00:05:47,293 --> 00:05:49,460
我能让它好用
But I can make it work.

85
00:05:49,485 --> 00:05:51,020
精神可嘉啊
That's the spirit.

86
00:05:51,045 --> 00:05:53,299
在那之前 好好玩吧...
Until then, young man...

87
00:05:53,324 --> 00:05:55,740
年轻人
have fun.

88
00:06:06,912 --> 00:06:09,315
绝对不行
Absolutely not.

89
00:06:09,438 --> 00:06:11,338
我挺喜欢他
I like him.

90
00:06:11,363 --> 00:06:13,896
雅典娜 不行
Athena, no.

发明创造大厅

92
00:06:26,972 --> 00:06:29,964
你凭什么觉得这玩意能飞?
What makes you think you're gonna make this thing fly?

93
00:06:29,989 --> 00:06:32,213
- 我是个乐天派  - 你在浪费时间
- I'm optimistic.  - You're wasting your time.

94
00:06:32,238 --> 00:06:33,900
- 不是  - 乱七八糟
- I'm not.  - Damn contraption.

95
00:06:33,925 --> 00:06:35,808
才不是乱七八糟!
It's not a contraption!

96
00:06:35,833 --> 00:06:37,040
根本不能飞
It doesn't work.

97
00:06:37,065 --> 00:06:40,320
- 我会让它飞起来的  - 不 你不能
- I can make it work.  - No, you can't.

98
00:06:40,453 --> 00:06:42,937
我绝不会放弃的
I'm not giving up.

99
00:06:46,351 --> 00:06:48,701
别转过来 装作没事
Don't turn around. Be cool.

100
00:06:48,726 --> 00:06:50,275
我不是说别转过来吗?
What did I just tell you?

101
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:52,013
- 抱歉  - 别说话
- Sorry.  - Stop talking.

102
00:06:52,038 --> 00:06:54,965
看那边 五点钟方向
Look over there, 5 o'clock.

103

You know? On a clock?

104
00:06:59,223 --> 00:07:01,432
五点在哪?

105
00:07:04,292 --> 00:07:06,158

Don't get spotted.

108
00:07:18,394 --> 00:07:20,411

So. What is this place?

142
00:15:40,625 --> 00:15:43,385
然后一切急转直下
And then, everything went to hell.

143
00:15:43,721 --> 00:15:45,127
- 哦 天啊  - 没错
- Oh, boy.  - Well it did.

144
00:15:45,152 --> 00:15:48,372
所以你可以跟他们讲蓝天 喷气背包...
So you gave them like, one second of blue skies and jet packs and....

145
00:15:48,373 --> 00:15:50,557
他们应该知道其中的风险
It's important they need to know the stakes.

146
00:15:50,582 --> 00:15:53,163
我想他们能够发现 所剩时间有限
I think they can figure out clocks counting down on them.

147
00:15:53,188 --> 00:15:54,690
- 要不你来讲吧?  - 不 还是你讲吧
- Do you want to tell the story?  - No, you're gonna...

148
00:15:54,715 --> 00:15:56,294
如果你觉得讲得比我好
Because if you think you can tell the story better

149
00:15:56,319 --> 00:15:58,761
我很乐意一边听着
I would absolutely love to hear you try.

150
00:15:58,786 --> 00:16:00,692
- 哦 真的吗?  - 当然是真的
- Wow, really?  - Really.

151
00:16:00,712 --> 00:16:03,489
也许我比你更够格
Well, I guess technically I am more qualified.

152
00:16:03,514 --> 00:16:06,583
是么? 为什么?
Are you? How so?

153
00:16:06,608 --> 00:16:10,211
因为我不像你 我是个乐天派
Because unlike you, I'm an optimist.

154
00:16:10,236 --> 00:16:12,286
- 嘿 宝贝 你开始拍了吗?  - 是录像

156
00:16:13,372 --> 00:16:16,167
- 你在录像  - 好的 继续录 宝贝

开始吧 凯西

158

那是天狼星

159
00:16:19,710 --> 00:16:21,782
那是老人星

163
00:16:30,747 --> 00:16:33,837
你为什么这么喜欢星星 凯西?
Why do you love the stars so much, Casey?

164
00:16:34,872 --> 00:16:37,988
因为我想去星星上面
Because, I wanna go there.

165
00:16:38,013 --> 00:16:39,636
但那太远了
But it's so far away.

166
00:16:40,161 --> 00:16:42,425
需要很长时间才能到 非常长
It will take a long time. A real long time.

167
00:16:42,450 --> 00:16:46,137
如果你好不容易到了 却发现那里什么也没有 怎么办?
What if you get all the way up there and there's nothing?

168
00:16:47,271 --> 00:16:51,259
也可能什么都有
What if there's everything.

169
00:16:51,284 --> 00:16:52,658
- 天啊  - 怎么了?
- Oh, boy.  - What?

170
00:16:52,683 --> 00:16:54,307
你打算把你的童年回忆一遍?
We're gonna go through your entire childhood?

171
00:16:54,332 --> 00:16:56,620
你也是从小时候说起的 我只是想说一下背景
You started when you were a kid. I'm just giving them context.

172
00:16:56,645 --> 00:16:58,613
快说正题 好吧? 时间有限
Just move it along, okay? They don't have all day.

173
00:16:58,638 --> 00:17:00,684
好的 没问题

Nate, if you wake up dad, I will crush you.

177
00:20:07,594 --> 00:20:09,492
你不该偷溜出去
You shouldn't sneak out.

178
00:20:09,517 --> 00:20:12,387
你还不该盖着婴儿毯呢
Well you shouldn't still need a lovey.

179
00:20:12,412 --> 00:20:14,614
爸爸说我可以盖的
Dad says it's okay to sleep with.

180
00:20:14,639 --> 00:20:17,176
那是因为他不希望你长大
That's because he doesn't want you to grow up.

181
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:19,929
你又去发射站了吗?
Were you at the platform again?

182
00:20:20,632 --> 00:20:22,728
你去那里做什么?
What do you do out there?

183
00:20:22,872 --> 00:20:26,440
你在设法阻止他们? 不让他们拆了那里?
Are you trying to stop them? From taking it down?

184
00:20:26,465 --> 00:20:29,969
不 那样就犯法了
No. That would make me a criminal

185
00:20:29,994 --> 00:20:34,986
而且不是小孩子们的好榜样 特别是对于你
and a pretty terrible role model to impressionable youth such as yourself.

186
00:20:35,116 --> 00:20:38,807
但如果有人这么做了
But if someone else did it

187
00:20:38,867 --> 00:20:40,934
我想
I've to assume,

188
00:20:40,959 --> 00:20:43,151
他们会相信
they believed,

189
00:20:43,252 --> 00:20:45,951
即使是小孩子们的行为
even the teeniest of actions

190
00:20:46,025 --> 00:20:49,719
也可以改变未来

191
00:20:50,184 --> 00:20:52,269
你怎么那么肯定?
How can you be sure?

192
00:20:52,294 --> 00:20:54,720
因为我懂得多
Because I know how things work.

193
00:20:56,452 --> 00:20:59,526
他们为什么要拆发射站?
Why are they taking the platform down?

194
00:21:00,112 --> 00:21:04,912
因为很多事做起来难 放弃却很容易
Guess it's hard to have ideas, and easy to give up.

195
00:21:05,552 --> 00:21:07,611
但你不会放弃的
But you won't,

196
00:21:07,636 --> 00:21:09,151
对吧?
right?

好消息是你可以休息一天了
Well at least you get the day off.

怎么了?
Yeah?

216
00:22:45,557 --> 00:22:48,447
他们肯定会拆掉发射站的
Nothing's gonna stop 'em from taking down that platform.

217
00:22:48,472 --> 00:22:51,622
肯定会 而且如果拆完了 我就失业了
Nothing. And when we're done, I'm out of a job.

218
00:22:51,647 --> 00:22:54,040
谁也无法阻止这件事的发生
There's nothing anyone can do about it.

219
00:22:54,065 --> 00:22:56,803
- 不可避免  - 你会找到新工作的

278

你大呼小叫的干嘛?
Why are you yelling at me?

279
00:27:49,078 --> 00:27:51,463
老爸 开车时不要碰 太危险了

285
00:28:04,933 --> 00:28:07,988
眼观超前的航天局老爸 好吗?
New frontier dad, okay?

你够了!

00:28:45,618 --> 00:28:49,498
老实说 凯西 我不知道你是中了什么邪
Honestly, Casey. I don't know what's gotten into you.

292
00:31:45,482 --> 00:31:47,792
- 拉我一把 伙计们  - 动作不行啊 德克斯特  
- Come on, guys.  - Bad move, Dexter.

293
00:31:47,817 --> 00:31:49,789
真是吓尿了
Totally sweat.

294
00:31:53,232 --> 00:31:54,501
走吧 逗逼们
Come on, idiots.

295
00:31:54,526 --> 00:31:56,668
我们要赶不上参加研发了

296
00:32:48,905 --> 00:32:53,596
悬浮列车还有一分钟到站
The hover rail will be arriving in 1 minute.

297
00:33:15,378 --> 00:33:17,025

下一站 航天港
Next stop: Space port.

301
00:34:27,773 --> 00:34:29,429
爸爸 你别为难我了
Dad, you're embarrassing me.

302
00:34:29,454 --> 00:34:30,955
难道你能做到每天都传送吗?
Do you promise you'll transmit everyday?

303
00:34:30,980 --> 00:34:34,199
- 甚至当你在覆盖范围外  - 拜托 这又不是什么大事
- Even when you're out of range.  - Come on, what's the big deal.

我们只不过出门二十光年远而已
We're only going twenty light years out.

航天港到了

你闻起来像刚从沼泽地里爬出来一样

315
00:36:30,919 --> 00:36:32,476
那好吧
Fine.

316
00:36:32,685 --> 00:36:35,955
我们到底在搜索什么?
What are we looking for?

317
00:36:39,353 --> 00:36:40,770
停! 找的就是就是它
Stop! That's it.

Whoa. This site is like ancient.

321

把他们的电话给我

没有电话?
They don't have a number?

不过有个地址
They have an address.

325

- Can you do that for me?  - Only if you tell me what's going on.

328
00:37:14,292 --> 00:37:16,477

331
00:37:24,452 --> 00:37:26,388
未来
the future.

332
00:37:29,105 --> 00:37:31,074
我也能去吗?
Can I come, too?

333
00:37:31,948 --> 00:37:34,582
暂时... 还不行
Not... yet.

334
00:37:57,919 --> 00:38:01,263
你好 请问凯西·纽顿在家吗?

335
00:38:01,288 --> 00:38:02,861

当然了

339
00:38:09,013 --> 00:38:10,610
那你为什么没有穿制服?
Why aren't you wearing a uniform?

340
00:38:10,635 --> 00:38:12,308
衣服拿去洗了
It's at the cleaners.

341
00:38:12,333 --> 00:38:14,263
可你拿的明明是奥利奥
Those are Oreos.

342
00:38:16,284 --> 00:38:18,847
你能告诉我凯西什么时候会回来吗?
Could you please tell me when Casey will be back?

343
00:38:18,872 --> 00:38:22,593
她和朋友去露营了 要在外面待好几天
She went camping with some friends. She's gonna be gone for a couple of days.

344
00:38:22,618 --> 00:38:25,205
你就是这样告诉你父母的吧?
Is that what you told your parents?

345
00:38:26,245 --> 00:38:27,968
是的...
Um... Yeah.

346
00:38:27,993 --> 00:38:29,132
可这并不是实话
But it's not true.

347
00:38:29,132 --> 00:38:30,663
是实话
Yeah, it is.

348
00:38:30,688 --> 00:38:33,033
不 内森 不是实话
No, Nathan. It's not.

349
00:38:33,058 --> 00:38:34,849
不要问我怎么知道你的名字
Don't ask me how I knew your name.

350
00:38:34,874 --> 00:38:39,093
我同样知道你在对我说谎
I know it the same way I know that you're lying to me.

351
00:38:39,712 --> 00:38:41,972
你是从未来来的吗?
Are you from the future?

352
00:38:41,973 --> 00:38:44,127
你猜的很准嘛
You clearly understand.

353
00:38:44,152 --> 00:38:47,729
所以 为什么不告诉我实情?
So why aren't you telling me what I need to know?

354
00:38:48,531 --> 00:38:49,829
那枚勋章
That pin thing,

355
00:38:49,854 --> 00:38:53,359
失效了 所以她想去再找一枚
it stopped working. She went to find another one.

356
00:38:53,384 --> 00:38:56,566
内森 她去哪儿了?
Nathan, where is she looking?

357
00:39:24,858 --> 00:39:26,332

Oh. No thanks, I'm not here to buy anything.

361
00:39:34,359 --> 00:39:37,659
我是想打听这东西的信息
I was hoping that you could tell me about this.

362
00:39:41,485 --> 00:39:43,314
雨果!

363
00:39:44,024 --> 00:39:45,537

多谢你的帮忙 亲爱的
Thank you for the help, dear.

366
00:39:56,129 --> 00:39:57,775
如果你不关门的话根本就不需要我多此一举
Well. If you'd just kept it open you wouldn't need my help.

367
00:39:57,800 --> 00:39:59,842
不关门的话就会破坏哥帅气的出场效果
If I kept it open it would ruin the effect which is everything.

368
00:39:59,867 --> 00:40:02,604
原谅我老婆 她就是不懂欣赏 我是雨果·卡恩兹巴克
Pardon my wife, she has no respect for showmanship. Hugo Gernsback.

她有枚勋章
She has a pin.

371
00:40:07,679 --> 00:40:09,105
我看见你在网路上寻找这东西...
I saw that you were looking for one online...

372
00:40:09,130 --> 00:40:10,813
你是从哪儿得到这东西的?
Where did you get it?

373
00:40:10,838 --> 00:40:12,064
你能告诉我这勋章的信息吗?
What can you tell me about it?

374
00:40:12,089 --> 00:40:14,746
你得告诉我这枚勋章是谁给你的 我才能告诉你勋章的信息
I can't tell you anything about it unless you tell me who gave it to you.

375
00:40:14,771 --> 00:40:16,999
我才不要先开口
I'm not going first.

376
00:40:17,711 --> 00:40:19,985
那好吧 我们没得谈了
Well it seems our business here is done.

377
00:40:20,472 --> 00:40:22,685
看起来确实如此
Seems it is.

378
00:40:28,578 --> 00:40:30,826
当你触碰到它的时候
Saw something, didn't you.

379
00:40:32,785 --> 00:40:34,642
你看到了不一样的东西 对吗?
When you touched it.

380
00:40:36,352 --> 00:40:38,972
看见了不可思议的场景?
Something incredible?

381
00:40:41,312 --> 00:40:42,641
那是真的吗?
It's real?

382
00:40:42,666 --> 00:40:43,921
当然是真的了
Of course it is.

383
00:40:43,946 --> 00:40:48,628
别问我为什么我们想也不敢想的高科技已经被这些人开放出来了
Don't ask me how these people have developed technologies we haven't even dreamed of yet.

384
00:40:49,053 --> 00:40:52,363
等等 什么这些人?
Wait. What people?

385
00:40:56,418 --> 00:40:59,307
你有没有想象过
Have you ever wondered what would happen

386
00:40:59,332 --> 00:41:03,980
当所有天才 艺术家 科学家汇聚一堂的时候 会发生什么...
if all the geniuses, the artists, the scientists, the...

387
00:41:04,005 --> 00:41:07,054
世界上最聪明 最富有创造力的人...
smartest, most creative people in the world...

388
00:41:07,079 --> 00:41:10,724
决心改变世界?
decided to actually change it?

389
00:41:11,406 --> 00:41:13,299
可是要在哪儿?
But where?

390
00:41:13,324 --> 00:41:15,203
在哪儿他们才能做这事儿呢?
Where could they even do such a thing?

391
00:41:15,228 --> 00:41:19,965
他们需要一个没有政治 没有官僚主义 没有干扰
They'd need a place free from politics, bureaucracy, distractions,

392
00:41:19,990 --> 00:41:21,342
没有贪念的地方
greed.

393
00:41:21,367 --> 00:41:23,013
一个神秘的地方
A secret place.

394
00:41:23,038 --> 00:41:27,642
在那里 他们可以尽情的发挥自己的想象
Where they could build whatever they were crazy enough to imagine.

395
00:41:27,667 --> 00:41:30,290
他们称自己为"至高点"
'Plus Ultra', they called themselves.

396
00:41:30,315 --> 00:41:34,808
然而唯一能看见这个地方的方法 只有通过接触这些勋章
The only way to see it, however, is through contact with one of these.

397
00:41:34,833 --> 00:41:37,693
他们制造这些勋章干嘛? 想用来做什么?
Why did they make them? What are they for?

398
00:41:37,718 --> 00:41:39,254
有流言说...
Rumor has it...

399
00:41:39,279 --> 00:41:41,628
他们想要把这个秘密公之于众
They were about to go public.

400
00:41:41,653 --> 00:41:43,892
和全世界一起分享这个成果
Share what they had built with the whole world.

401
00:41:43,893 --> 00:41:46,103
可不幸的是...
Unfortunately...

402
00:41:46,319 --> 00:41:48,260
没能成功
That never happened.

403
00:41:48,511 --> 00:41:50,191
为什么没能成功?
Why not?

404
00:41:50,511 --> 00:41:53,620
我想我已经说了够多了 小姑娘 我...
I think we've shared enough, young lady. I...

405
00:41:57,032 --> 00:41:59,171
看在我对你坦诚相待的份上...
As, we've decided to trust you...

406
00:41:59,196 --> 00:42:02,764
也相信我吧 告诉我
Please, trust us. And tell me,

407

But I didn't know how to tell you the truth because...

看到了
Yeah!

601
00:57:16,080 --> 00:57:19,687
是全息图像 大白天你怎么做到的?
It's a hologram. How did you do that in daylight?

602
00:57:19,712 --> 00:57:21,619
- 很厉害啊  - 你是谁?
- Pretty impressive.  - Who are you?

603
00:57:21,644 --> 00:57:23,107
你想干嘛?
What do you want?

604
00:57:23,132 --> 00:57:25,770

我碰到这东西后看到的地方

你哪里拿到的?
Where did you get this?

610
00:57:54,748 --> 00:57:57,520
从小女孩 叫雅典娜
A little girl. Athena.

611
00:57:57,693 --> 00:57:59,063
她在哪里?
Where is she?

612
00:57:59,088 --> 00:58:01,492
她把我抛在这里了...
She ditched me here...

613

她当然这么做了 听着

不管你从哪里来 小鬼 回家去

- What I saw...  - What you saw, is gone.

617
00:58:13,668 --> 00:58:16,268
你寻找的这东西 它已经不存在了
This, what you're looking for, it doesn't exist anymore.

618
00:58:16,693 --> 00:58:19,096
不 我的直觉告诉我 我必须去那里
No, I feel... I feel like, like I have to go.

619
00:58:19,121 --> 00:58:21,160
那里是我应该去的地方
Like, I'm supposed to go.

620
00:58:21,185 --> 00:58:22,488
为什么?
Why?

621
00:58:22,513 --> 00:58:26,791
因为他们在火箭里给你留了个位置?
Because they're saving a seat on a rocket ship just for you?

622
00:58:27,836 --> 00:58:31,624
你看到的是几十年前录下的一段广告
What you saw was a commercial that was recorded decades ago.

你不用做任何事情
You are not supposed to do anything.

You've been manipulated to feel like you're part of something incredible.

626
00:58:43,882 --> 00:58:46,033

Like you were special.

627

635
01:01:05,360 --> 01:01:07,405
我不会走的!
I'm not leaving!

636
01:01:07,430 --> 01:01:09,908
你要么告诉我怎么去哪里 要么杀了我!
Either tell me how to get there, or kill me!

637
01:01:09,933 --> 01:01:14,816
如果你碰里面任何东西 不用说我也直接动手!
If you touch anything in there, that's exactly what I'll do!

638
01:01:17,038 --> 01:01:18,098
你在干什么?
What are you doing?

639
01:01:18,123 --> 01:01:21,275
我就随便乱摸了!
I'm touching things!

640
01:01:23,557 --> 01:01:26,577
马上给我开门!
Open this door, now!

641
01:01:27,279 --> 01:01:30,800
我说真的 我要把你臭揍一顿
I'm serious. I'll knock you out.

642
01:01:35,165 --> 01:01:39,186
这个像伸缩长号一样的东西是什么
Hey what's this doohickey with a trombone slidey thing?

643
01:01:39,211 --> 01:01:41,383
别乱动! 我说真的!
Leave that alone! I'm serious!

644
01:01:41,408 --> 01:01:42,942
那你会带我去那里吗?
Will you take me there?

645
01:01:42,967 --> 01:01:46,410
- 不会!  - 那你哪里认真了!
- No!  - Then you're not serious!

646
01:01:49,512 --> 01:01:53,532
拜托 你不觉得这个有趣吗?
Oh come on. You didn't think that was funny?

647
01:01:53,691 --> 01:01:55,498
你是在录像吗?
You're recording this?

648
01:01:55,523 --> 01:01:57,924
如果我能让你笑 我想...
If I get you to laugh, I wanna, you know,

649
01:01:57,949 --> 01:01:59,868
记录下来以后再看
have it for posterity.

650
01:01:59,893 --> 01:02:01,259
我笑过了
I laughed.

651
01:02:01,284 --> 01:02:04,012
你是微笑 微笑不是一种笑
You smiled. A smile's not a laugh.

652
01:02:04,013 --> 01:02:06,885
所有人都会笑 这是生物的一种需求
Everyone laughs. It's a biological need.

653
01:02:06,886 --> 01:02:10,137
实际上你错了 睡觉才是生物的一种需求
Actually it isn't. Sleep is a biological need.

654
01:02:10,162 --> 01:02:12,724
我也从来没见过你睡觉
And I've never seen you sleep, either.

655
01:02:14,532 --> 01:02:17,843
不管迟早 我总会让你笑的
Well, sooner or later I'm gonna make you laugh.

656
01:02:17,868 --> 01:02:20,710
直到你笑出来 我是不会放弃的
Until you do, I'm not gonna stop trying.

657
01:02:20,735 --> 01:02:22,805
也许你应该放弃
Maybe you should.

658
01:02:23,465 --> 01:02:24,915
什么?
What?

659
01:02:25,606 --> 01:02:27,803
别再试了
Stop trying.

660
01:02:29,904 --> 01:02:31,526
为什么?
Why?

661
01:02:33,392 --> 01:02:35,756
你一定要录下来吗?
Must you record this?

662
01:03:34,432 --> 01:03:36,150
- 出去!  - 等一下
- Get out!  - Wait a second.

663
01:03:36,175 --> 01:03:38,200
这是... 这是什么? 是倒计时吗?
What is... What is that? Is that a countdown?

664
01:03:38,225 --> 01:03:40,602
我不会走的 我应该要知道这里的情况
I am not leaving. I deserve to know what's going on around here.

665
01:03:40,627 --> 01:03:42,604
- 你应该?  - 对的 我应该要知道些答案
- You deserve?  - Yeah, I deserve some answers.

666
01:03:42,629 --> 01:03:44,445
- 什么答案?  - 我知道你曾经在那里
- Answers to what?  - I know that you were there.

667
01:03:44,470 --> 01:03:45,592
你什么都不懂
You don't know anything.

668
01:03:45,617 --> 01:03:47,335
你怎么能离开那地方?
How can you ever leave a place like that?

669
01:03:47,360 --> 01:03:49,595
因为他们赶我走的!
Because they threw me out!

670
01:03:54,908 --> 01:03:59,290
他们赶我走的 然后他们把所有通道都锁上了
They threw me out and they locked every door back in.

671
01:04:00,995 --> 01:04:04,971
是因为你造了一个你不应该造的东西?
Was it because you built that something that you shouldn't have?

672
01:04:04,996 --> 01:04:06,694
谁告诉你的?
Who told you that?

673
01:04:06,719 --> 01:04:11,502
就是这个? 那个东西?
Is that it? The something?

674
01:04:13,845 --> 01:04:16,189
如果我能准确地告诉你...
If I could tell you the date...

675
01:04:16,214 --> 01:04:18,424
你死的日期...
The exact date that you're gonna die...

676
01:04:18,449 --> 01:04:21,004
- 你愿意知道吗?  - 你怎么知道的?
- Would you wanna know?  - How would you know?

677
01:04:21,029 --> 01:04:23,130
- 假设我就知道了  - 怎么 你是通灵的?
- Let's just say I did.  - What, are you psychic?

678
01:04:23,155 --> 01:04:25,059
- 不是 但这不是重点  - 那你是怎么知道的呢?
- No, that's not the point.  - Then what is your basis for knowing this.

679
01:04:25,084 --> 01:04:29,887
假设上来说 好吧 就... 就
Hypothetical. Alright, just... just use your imagination. Alright?

680
01:04:30,176 --> 01:04:32,265
- 好的  - 好吧
- Alright.  - Okay.

681
01:04:32,290 --> 01:04:36,267
就假设前提是有这么一个宇宙 我完全肯定地知道
Just accept that there's a world where I know with absolute certainty,

682
01:04:36,292 --> 01:04:39,741
你的死亡日期
the exact time of your death.

683
01:04:40,115 --> 01:04:41,179
那现在
Now.

684
01:04:41,204 --> 01:04:43,050
你想让我告诉你吗?
You want me to tell you or not?

685
01:04:43,075 --> 01:04:45,931
当然想啦 谁不想呢?
Of course, I would. Who wouldn't?

686
01:04:47,072 --> 01:04:48,376
但...
But.

687
01:04:49,086 --> 01:04:50,611
如果...
What if...

688
01:04:50,889 --> 01:04:53,807
知道我的死期是导致我死亡的原因...
Accepting my death is what causes it...

689
01:04:53,832 --> 01:04:55,477
答案还是"想知道"
so the answer is "Yes".

690
01:04:55,502 --> 01:04:57,640
我想要你告诉我
I would want you to tell me,

691
01:04:57,665 --> 01:04:59,579
- 但我不会相信你  - 你不得不相信我
- But I wouldn't believe you.  - You have to believe me.

692
01:04:59,604 --> 01:05:03,199
为什么? 不是说 自己的路自己决定吗?
Why? Don't we like, make our own destiny and stuff?

693
01:05:10,550 --> 01:05:12,044
怎么了?
What?

694
01:05:18,894 --> 01:05:21,122
小鬼 你是谁?
Who are you, kid?

695
01:05:24,515 --> 01:05:26,310
有坏消息吗?
Is that bad?

696
01:05:29,692 --> 01:05:31,517
我的天啊
Oh, hell.

697
01:05:31,542 --> 01:05:33,430
天啊!
Oh, hell!

698
01:05:43,870 --> 01:05:47,028
- 他们跟着你来的  - 什么? 谁啊?
- They followed you here.  - What? Who?

699
01:05:47,053 --> 01:05:48,694
机器人
Robots.

700
01:05:50,255 --> 01:05:52,202
我从来没见过他们
I've never seen them before.

701
01:05:52,227 --> 01:05:54,028
约翰·弗朗西斯·沃克
John Francis Walker.

702
01:05:54,053 --> 01:05:57,227
因为同意不再干扰 所以你才被允许继续活着
You have been permitted to live based upon your agreed non-intervention.

703
01:05:57,252 --> 01:05:59,696
如今你包庇一名逃犯
You are now harboring a fugitive element.

704
01:05:59,721 --> 01:06:02,328
把她交给我们扣押 否则准备被消灭
Release her to our custody or be extinguished.

705
01:06:02,353 --> 01:06:04,830
你只有1分钟做出选择
You have 1 minute to comply.

706
01:06:20,481 --> 01:06:22,888
- 谢谢  - 先别谢我
- Thanks.  - Don't thank me yet.

707
01:06:30,567 --> 01:06:31,851
嗯!
Huh!

708
01:06:41,315 --> 01:06:42,885
等等
Wait.

709
01:07:49,418 --> 01:07:50,937
快点!
Come on!

710
01:07:54,331 --> 01:07:55,704
当心!
Look out!

711
01:08:13,508 --> 01:08:14,953
快走
Go.

712
01:08:21,132 --> 01:08:23,529
约翰·弗朗西斯·沃克 根据尼克斯总督的授权
John Francis Walker. By authority of Governor Nix.

713
01:08:23,554 --> 01:08:26,937
本机已经获权... 结束你的生命
This unit has been authorized... to extinguish your life...

714
01:08:30,607 --> 01:08:31,862
好了
Okay.

715
01:08:36,385 --> 01:08:37,660
好了
Okay.

716
01:08:39,946 --> 01:08:42,903
好了 敲够了 打够了
Alright, that's enough. That's enough.

717
01:08:45,639 --> 01:08:47,907
随手关门
Close the door.

718
01:08:48,680 --> 01:08:51,039
尼克斯总督是什么人
Who the hell is Governor Nix?

719
01:08:51,834 --> 01:08:54,020
快走 麻利点
Let's go. Come on.

720
01:08:59,272 --> 01:09:01,906
这个算个鬼办法啊?!
How is this a good idea?!

721
01:09:31,053 --> 01:09:33,396
哇哦!
Whoa!

722
01:09:33,982 --> 01:09:35,319
快点 不然就沉了 小鬼!
Move or sink, kid!

723
01:09:35,344 --> 01:09:38,100
你还真有备无患啊?
You were actually prepared for that?

724
01:09:47,294 --> 01:09:49,019
- 我的帽子  - 别管它了
- My hat.  - Leave it.

725
01:09:49,044 --> 01:09:51,565
不行 不行 我不能丢了它
No no no. I can't go without it.

726
01:09:57,504 --> 01:09:59,456
这是我老爸的
It's my dad's.

727
01:10:01,985 --> 01:10:04,609
太聪明了对你自己不好
You're too smart for your own good.

728
01:10:04,685 --> 01:10:08,299
你老爸无法理解你 不会支持你
Your father never understood you, never supported you.

729
01:10:08,324 --> 01:10:10,590
而你现在带着他的帽子
Now you wear his hat,

730
01:10:10,615 --> 01:10:12,354
不知道是纪念还是叛逆
as a badge or rebellion.

731
01:10:12,379 --> 01:10:13,892
没错吧?
Right?

732
01:10:14,492 --> 01:10:17,456
不是 我老爸可棒了
No. My Dad is amazing.

733
01:10:20,537 --> 01:10:23,363
哦 等等 我们...
Oh. Wait a second. We're not...

734
01:10:23,627 --> 01:10:26,178
我们不是在说我 对吧?
We're not talking about me, are we?

735
01:10:28,627 --> 01:10:31,004
我是要把你送回你了不起的爸爸身边
Well, we just get you to your amazing dad...

736
01:10:31,029 --> 01:10:33,390
假装这一切从没发生过
Pretend this never happened.

737
01:10:33,738 --> 01:10:35,337
坐上来
Hop on.

738
01:10:37,657 --> 01:10:39,251
- 电池没电了  - 不可能
- Battery's dead.  - No, it's not.

739
01:10:39,276 --> 01:10:41,738
- 也许该换了  - 不是的
- Well maybe it's the point. - No, it's not.

740
01:10:41,763 --> 01:10:44,519
- 你上次开...  - 你知道你在帮倒忙吧?
- When's the last time you tried...  - You know you're not helping?

741
01:10:47,238 --> 01:10:49,483
躲起来 快点
Get down. Now.

742
01:11:03,045 --> 01:11:04,490
等等
Wait.

743
01:11:07,418 --> 01:11:09,346
你好 弗兰克
Hello, Frank.

744
01:11:16,145 --> 01:11:18,650
你打算开枪吗?
Are you going to shoot me?

745
01:11:20,078 --> 01:11:22,839
- 我还在考虑...  - 你能进车里考虑吗?
- I'm deciding...  - Could you decide in the truck?

746
01:11:22,864 --> 01:11:25,428
因为我们真的需要快点出发了
Because we really should get going.

747
01:11:26,391 --> 01:11:27,740
等等
Wait.

748
01:11:28,565 --> 01:11:31,192
怎么了 等其他更多机器人来吗?
Why, so more robots can show up?

749
01:11:33,505 --> 01:11:34,934
她算其中一个
She's one of 'em.

750
01:11:34,959 --> 01:11:37,544
我知道的 你到底来不来啊?
Yeah, I know. Are you coming or not?

751
01:11:43,225 --> 01:11:45,344
过去点
Move over.

752
01:12:04,706 --> 01:12:06,975
- 弗兰克?  - 还没想好呢
- Frank?  - Not yet.

753
01:12:08,540 --> 01:12:11,062
你在想什么 你干嘛要把她扯进来?
What were you thinking, why would you drag her into this?

754
01:12:11,087 --> 01:12:13,276
我没把她扯进什么里面
I didn't drag her into anything.

755
01:12:13,301 --> 01:12:16,410
我就给了她一枚勋章 其余是她自己的事
I gave her a pin. She did the rest.

756
01:12:16,844 --> 01:12:17,915
和你一个样
Just like you.

757
01:12:17,940 --> 01:12:21,387
哦 别... 你从哪里找到勋章的?
Oh, don't even... And where did you even find the pin?

758
01:12:21,412 --> 01:12:22,932
我亲眼看到他们毁掉了所有勋章
I was there. They destroyed them.

759
01:12:22,957 --> 01:12:26,096
没有都毁 我还藏着近十个
Not all of them. I made it out with nearly a dozen.

760
01:12:26,121 --> 01:12:27,438
所以你给了一个小年轻?
So you give one to a teenager?

761
01:12:27,463 --> 01:12:30,998
嗨 我可是在什么费恩伯格·杜塞多夫测试里得了73分的
Hey, I got a 73 on the Feinberg- Dusseldorf scale or whatever.

762
01:12:31,023 --> 01:12:33,482
- 你得了73分? 这不可能的事  - 嗯哼
- You got a 73? That's not possible.  - Mm-Hm.

763
01:12:33,507 --> 01:12:35,714
他是妒忌你 因为他只有41分
He's jealous because he scored 41.

764
01:12:35,739 --> 01:12:37,781
什... 你懂什么? 我那时才11岁
Wha... You know what? I was 11.

765
01:12:37,806 --> 01:12:39,492
才11岁
I was 11.

766
01:12:39,517 --> 01:12:41,380
别动它!
Don't touch that!

767
01:12:41,405 --> 01:12:45,867
这是一千吨当量的炸药 不是什么玩具
This is a 1 kiloton detonation, it is not a toy.

768
01:12:45,892 --> 01:12:48,476
别乱动我东西 你听懂吗?
Do not mess with my stuff. You got it?

769
01:12:48,501 --> 01:12:51,929
- 对不起  - 我最开始不是选她的 你知道吗
- Sorry.  - I didn't begin with her, you know.

770
01:12:51,954 --> 01:12:54,797
我花了好几年挑选潜在对象
I wasted years holding out for potential candidates.

771
01:12:54,822 --> 01:12:57,570
潜在对象? 干什么啊?
Potential candidates? For what?

772
01:12:58,007 --> 01:12:59,213
哦吼吼...
Oh-ho-ho...

773
01:12:59,238 --> 01:13:02,481
有意思了 你还认为你
That's beautiful. You still think you're recruiting, don't you?

774
01:13:02,506 --> 01:13:04,280
别再问她更多问题了
Do not ask her any more questions.

775
01:13:04,305 --> 01:13:06,025
不然她分分钟关机给你看
She's gonna do her countermeasure shutdown thing.

776
01:13:06,050 --> 01:13:07,267
防范关机措施?
What countermeasure shutdown?

777
01:13:07,292 --> 01:13:09,388
你告诉她 你有什么防范关机措施?
Did you tell her you had a countermeasure shutdown thing?

778
01:13:09,413 --> 01:13:13,197
- 是她在烦我  - 什么...? 你... 你骗我?
- She was annoying me.  - What...? You... You lied?

779
01:13:13,222 --> 01:13:14,493
早点习惯吧 小鬼
Get used to that, kid.

780
01:13:14,518 --> 01:13:16,574
前一秒 她保证你有个美好的未来
One minute, she's promising you a beautiful future.

781
01:13:16,599 --> 01:13:19,030
下一秒 她就带人来你家消灭你
Next thing you know, she's leading it to your house to kill you.

782
01:13:19,055 --> 01:13:22,488
对不起 但时间不等人 而你需要做事的动力
I'm sorry. But time is running out and you needed motivation.

783
01:13:22,513 --> 01:13:24,267
动力干什么啊?
Motivation for what?

784
01:13:24,292 --> 01:13:26,375
我们需要回去 弗兰克
We need to go back over, Frank.

785
01:13:26,400 --> 01:13:27,674
回去?
Back over there?

786
01:13:27,699 --> 01:13:29,265
好的 好的! 弗兰克 我们需要回去
Yes! Yes! Frank, we need to go back over.

787
01:13:29,290 --> 01:13:30,861
好的! 好极了 这是太好了
Good! Great. That's just great.

788
01:13:30,886 --> 01:13:34,868
老话怎么说的 "嗨 我被蜜蜂咬了 我们直接冲进蜂巢里吧"
You know, "Hey, I got stung by a bee, let's jump on the hive."

789
01:13:34,893 --> 01:13:36,165
这比喻太糟糕了
That's a terrible analogy.

790
01:13:36,190 --> 01:13:39,211
这个比喻再恰当不过! 你懂什么叫比喻吗?
That's a fantastic analogy! What do you know about analogy?

791
01:13:39,236 --> 01:13:41,458
你知道么 你这样子不可能和你好好交流的
You know you're impossible to talk to when you're like this.

792
01:13:41,483 --> 01:13:46,374
我想这个样子 因为你搞砸了我的生活! 现在也是!
I am like this, because you derailed my life! Again!

793
01:13:46,399 --> 01:13:51,750
弗兰克 我不是故意的 都是程序惹的祸
Frank, it's not personal. It's just programming.

794
01:13:53,187 --> 01:13:55,003
我们到了!
We're here!

795
01:14:01,693 --> 01:14:02,790
你要去哪里?
Where are you going?

796
01:14:02,815 --> 01:14:05,795
你在这里有个传送站 对吧
This is where your wire station's located, isn't it?

797
01:14:05,820 --> 01:14:07,438
我们要制造精彩表演
We need to get to the Spectacle.

798
01:14:07,463 --> 01:14:10,083
- 精彩表演  - 你疯了吗
- Spectacle?  - Hey. Are you insane?

799
01:14:10,108 --> 01:14:12,509
他们知道你派她来找我 他们早在这里候着我们了
They know that you sent her to me, they're gonna be waiting for us.

800
01:14:12,534 --> 01:14:15,390
好吧 把爱迪生管给我 我们自己去就行
Fine. Give me the Edison tube and we'll go without you.

801
01:14:15,415 --> 01:14:17,376
我没带爱迪生管
I don't have the Edison tube.

802
01:14:17,378 --> 01:14:19,273
就在你包里
It's in your bag.

803
01:14:19,420 --> 01:14:21,253
我自带X光透视功能
I have X-ray vision.

804
01:14:21,278 --> 01:14:23,989
- 你什么时候有透视能力了?  - 哦 她总是出人意料
- When did you get X-ray vision?  - Oh. She's full of surprises.

805
01:14:24,014 --> 01:14:27,172
我了解她的所有特点 其中最主要的一条是
I know all about her surprises. Chief among them is this,

806
01:14:27,197 --> 01:14:29,397
她不在乎你
she doesn't care about you.

807
01:14:29,422 --> 01:14:33,517
所有的吸引力 使命感 可爱的微笑
All that charm and the sense of purpose and the cute little smile.

808
01:14:33,542 --> 01:14:35,082
这都只是软件的作用
It's all just software.

809
01:14:35,407 --> 01:14:38,451
一堆0和1 仅此而已
It's 1s and 0s. That's it.

810
01:14:38,772 --> 01:14:42,228

Trust me, when you get there, you're on your own.

811
01:14:43,119 --> 01:14:44,958

812

他觉得我伤害了他

但绝不是笨蛋
But you were never dumb.

816
01:15:07,200 --> 01:15:08,902
你为什么不直接把爱迪生管给我?
Why don't you just give me the Edison tube?

817
01:15:08,927 --> 01:15:10,692
- 我什么也不会给你  - 还有...
- I'm not giving you anything.  - And...

818
01:15:10,719 --> 01:15:11,959
我...!

819
01:15:17,344 --> 01:15:18,789
好吧

820
01:15:18,814 --> 01:15:23,055
你想进? 我就带你进去 有何不可
You want in? I'll bring you in. Why not.

821
01:15:23,080 --> 01:15:27,456
有什么好过在这儿等待 受伤 被杀等等等等
What's better than waiting around here and getting hunted and killed, etc, etc.

822
01:15:27,481 --> 01:15:29,241
- 说到重点了!  - 等等?
- That's the spirit!  - Et cetera?

823
01:15:29,266 --> 01:15:31,616
等等是指什么?
What's the et cetera?

824
01:15:54,899 --> 01:15:56,440
这些是什么电缆?
What kind of cables are these?

825
01:15:56,465 --> 01:15:58,202
传输人的那种
The kind that transmit people.

826
01:15:58,227 --> 01:16:01,607
人 我们吗? 像微型传送机...
People, like us? What, like a miniature teleport...

827
01:16:02,032 --> 01:16:03,645
我一定得解释每件事吗?
Do I have to explain everything?

828
01:16:03,670 --> 01:16:07,198
你不能惊讶完就完了吗?
Can't you just be amazed and move on?

829
01:16:07,223 --> 01:16:10,311
这一切都奇怪得值得挖掘
This is all wired to the dish up there.

830
01:16:13,188 --> 01:16:16,272
你... 你用的是卫星吗?
Are you... Are you using satellite?

831
01:16:17,720 --> 01:16:19,820
我知道那是怎么运作的
I know how things work.

832
01:16:20,172 --> 01:16:22,550
来 给你个惊喜
Well, zip-a-Dee-doo for you.

833
01:16:23,699 --> 01:16:25,660
用这个把你的眼睛包起来 包紧
Wrap this around your eyes, tight.

834
01:16:25,661 --> 01:16:29,348
- 为什么?  - 因为正义是盲目的
- Why?  - Because justice is blind.

835
01:16:30,180 --> 01:16:32,893
你就照做吧 孩子
Just. Do it, kid.

836
01:16:33,203 --> 01:16:36,778
你要我用这个把头缠起来?
You want me to put this over my head?

837
01:16:37,607 --> 01:16:38,976
- 要是这个粘住我眉毛...  - 闭嘴
- If this sticks on my eyebrows...  - Shut up.

838
01:16:39,001 --> 01:16:41,093
张开嘴 头往后仰
Open your mouth, tilt your head back.

839
01:16:41,233 --> 01:16:44,234
啊 那是什么?

841
01:16:46,606 --> 01:16:48,165
可以出发了!
Good to go!

842
01:16:48,190 --> 01:16:50,366
很好 目的地设置为塔了吗?
Good. Did you set it for the tower?

843
01:16:50,391 --> 01:16:52,095
那里还有个接收器
There is still a receiver there.

844
01:16:52,120 --> 01:16:53,561
我上次检查过了
Last I checked.

845
01:16:53,586 --> 01:16:55,456
那是多久前了?
How long ago was that?

846
01:16:58,180 --> 01:17:00,243
25年前
25 years ago.

847
01:17:01,760 --> 01:17:03,240
大概吧
Roughly.

848
01:17:08,449 --> 01:17:10,554
他们也把你赶出去了?
They threw you out too?

849
01:17:11,001 --> 01:17:14,577
好了两位 杀手机器人
Okay guys, killer robots.

850
01:17:14,805 --> 01:17:18,403
好吧 一会儿会很亮 很冷 而且非常吵
Alright. It's gonna be bright, cold, and really loud.

851
01:17:18,428 --> 01:17:22,336
在百分之一秒内 你会失去90%的血糖
You're gonna lose 90% of your blood sugar in 1/100 of a per second

852
01:17:22,361 --> 01:17:24,096
你会希望自己死了
and you're gonna wish you were dead.

853
01:17:24,121 --> 01:17:25,979
到那时候 就结束了
By then, it'll be over.

854
01:17:26,849 --> 01:17:28,408
别尿我们身上
Don't pee on us.

855
01:17:28,433 --> 01:17:31,356
听起来很精彩
This sounds spectacular.

856
01:17:32,876 --> 01:17:35,814
为什么是现在? 为什么是她?
Why now? Why her?

857
01:17:35,866 --> 01:17:38,003
因为她没有放弃
Because she hasn't given up.

858
01:17:38,028 --> 01:17:40,304
你觉得她能修好它
You think she can fix it.

859
01:17:40,726 --> 01:17:42,785
为什么这么说?
What makes you say that?

860
01:17:45,213 --> 01:17:47,287
她可以吗 雅典娜?
Can she, Athena?

861
01:17:47,524 --> 01:17:49,523
我不知道
I have no idea.

862
01:17:50,406 --> 01:17:52,690
我们去寻找答案吧
Let's go find out.

863
01:18:03,813 --> 01:18:05,852
抓紧了
Hold on.

864
01:18:05,877 --> 01:18:08,895
这... 这是正常的吗?

我觉得要死了

01:18:32,219 --> 01:18:34,376
- 要死了 要死了  - 你不会死的
- I'm dying. I'm dying. - You're not dying.

869
01:18:34,401 --> 01:18:36,639
冰箱里有可乐
There's coke in the fridge.

870
01:18:54,567 --> 01:18:56,154
随便喝
Help yourself.

871
01:18:56,320 --> 01:18:58,976
我们不知道这里有多少人
We have no idea how many are here.

872
01:18:59,001 --> 01:19:00,942
但很肯定的是 他们知道我们来了 所以
But we're damn sure they know we're coming. So.

873
01:19:00,967 --> 01:19:04,946
我们动作要快 你们跟着我 不许提问 明白吗?
We move quickly, you follow me. No questions, got it?

874
01:19:05,913 --> 01:19:07,698
- 明白  - 好
- Got it.  - Alright.

875
01:19:15,299 --> 01:19:17,065
抱歉
Excuse me.

876
01:19:38,800 --> 01:19:40,136
我们在巴黎?
We're in Paris?

877
01:19:40,161 --> 01:19:41,781
你能不要这么惊讶吗?
Would you stop being so amazed?

878
01:19:41,806 --> 01:19:44,769
- 我还以为你希望我惊讶点  - 我希望你别再叫了
- I thought you wanted me to be amazed. - I want you to stop yapping.

880
01:19:50,833 --> 01:19:52,276
塔正在关闭
Tower's closing.

881
01:19:52,301 --> 01:19:54,416
该死
Oh, hell.

882
01:19:59,196 --> 01:20:00,684
过来
Come here.

883
01:20:00,895 --> 01:20:02,968
现在 我们俩会在他们的监视名单里
Now. You and I are gonna be on their watch list.

884
01:20:03,293 --> 01:20:06,621
他们也许还没上传你的面部识别文件
They may not have your facial recognition profile uploaded yet.

885
01:20:06,646 --> 01:20:08,389
- 也许?  - 也许 所以...
- May not?  - May not, so...

886
01:20:08,414 --> 01:20:11,263
你走到那里 拿着这个 敲他的脖子
You walk over there, you take this, you tap him on the neck.

887
01:20:11,264 --> 01:20:12,810
如果他是人类 它会直接敲晕他
If he's human, it knocks him right out.

888
01:20:12,835 --> 01:20:14,614
如果是机器人呢?
And if it's a robot?

889
01:20:15,666 --> 01:20:17,975
- 嘿  - 那你就直接惹怒它了
- Hey. - Then you'll just pissed it off.

890
01:20:18,074 --> 01:20:19,805
好极了
Fantastic.

891
01:20:22,707 --> 01:20:24,856
她有胆量 你得给她机会
She got guts. You gotta give her that.

892
01:20:31,866 --> 01:20:33,406
人类!
Human!

893
01:20:49,783 --> 01:20:52,137
当埃菲尔第一次在巴黎世界博览会上 揭幕这座铁塔时
The French hated this thing when Eiffel first unveiled it

894
01:20:52,162 --> 01:20:55,100
法国人都不喜欢它 觉得它碍眼
at the Paris World's Fair. They thought it was an eyesore.

895
01:20:55,125 --> 01:20:58,100
但埃菲尔并不在意 铁塔的意义不在于成为丰碑
Eiffel didn't care though. It wasn't meant to be a monument.

896
01:20:58,125 --> 01:21:00,282
而在于寻找另一个世界
It was meant to find another world.

897
01:21:00,283 --> 01:21:02,642
第一个传输站
Le cat premiere.

898
01:21:02,667 --> 01:21:04,170
加上四位伟人先驱
Plus Ultra's first four.

899
01:21:04,195 --> 01:21:05,839
他们也参与了这一切?
They were a part of all this?

900
01:21:05,864 --> 01:21:11,106
埃菲尔 儒勒·凡尔纳 特斯拉 以及爱迪生先生
Eiffel, Jules Verne, Tesla, and Mr. Edison.

901
01:21:12,393 --> 01:21:13,747
他们设计了这个天线 而我们正在里面...
They designed this antenna that we're inside...

902
01:21:13,772 --> 01:21:15,654
等等 什么? 埃菲尔铁塔是根天线?
Wait, what? The Eiffel Tower's an antenna?

903
01:21:15,655 --> 01:21:18,026
现在我终于回答你的问题了 你要打断我吗?
Now I finally answer your question. Are you gonna interrupt me?

904
01:21:18,051 --> 01:21:22,528
是的 特斯拉设计了天线来观察外面各种频率
Yes, Tesla designed the antenna to observe every kind of frequency out there.

905
01:21:22,553 --> 01:21:24,998
子空间 维度转换 应有尽有
Subspace, trans-dimensional, you name it.

906
01:21:25,023 --> 01:21:27,646
后来 他们真的找到了他们正在寻找的东西
And, they found exactly what they were looking for.

907
01:21:27,671 --> 01:21:29,694
再后来 爱迪生试图独揽功劳
And then, Edison tried to take credit for it,

908
01:21:29,719 --> 01:21:32,475
- 因为这两个人互相不满...  - 弗兰克
- because these two hate each other they....  - Frank.

909
01:21:32,500 --> 01:21:34,161
别偏题
Stay on topic.

910
01:21:34,186 --> 01:21:35,547
好
Yeah.

911
01:21:37,043 --> 01:21:41,300
当时谣言满地 都是从一个秘密入口传出来的...
There were all these rumors, of a secret entrance...

912
01:21:41,325 --> 01:21:47,441
那是这四个人留给自己的 一张单行票...
the four kept just for themselves, a one way ticket...

913
01:21:47,672 --> 01:21:50,410
以防不测
in case of emergencies.

914
01:21:54,093 --> 01:21:56,039
壮观的场面
The Spectacle.

915
01:22:28,173 --> 01:22:30,742
好戏还在后头 孩子
You ain't seen nothing yet, kid.

916
01:23:25,610 --> 01:23:29,067
哦不 旅行结束了
Oh no. The tour is over.

917
01:23:35,706 --> 01:23:37,834
这是个火箭
It's a rocket.

918
01:23:41,613 --> 01:23:43,490
他们来了
They're coming.

919
01:23:44,152 --> 01:23:45,638
好了
Alright.

920
01:24:03,606 --> 01:24:05,353
扣紧安全带
Buckle up.

921
01:24:22,217 --> 01:24:24,915
- 他说什么?  - 跟你能想到的差不多
- What'd he say?  - Pretty much what you'd expect.

922
01:24:24,940 --> 01:24:27,038
让他们别动
Tell them to hang on.

923
01:24:40,736 --> 01:24:43,969
哇... 吼...!
WOO...  HOO...!

924
01:25:37,788 --> 01:25:39,948
- 我们为什么往回走?  - 我们没有
- Why are we going back?  - We're not.

925
01:25:39,973 --> 01:25:42,569
我们要穿过去 到另一个维度
We're going through. To another dimension.

926
01:25:42,594 --> 01:25:46,056
所以我们冲进外太空 就为了助跑?
So we blasted into outer space just to get a running start?

927
01:25:46,081 --> 01:25:48,667
这个可能有点奇怪
This part may get a little weird.

928
01:26:43,887 --> 01:26:45,378
凯西
Casey.

929
01:26:45,413 --> 01:26:47,135
醒醒
Wake up.

930
01:26:48,859 --> 01:26:50,436
凯西?
Casey?

931
01:26:51,720 --> 01:26:54,322
凯西 醒醒
Casey. Wake up.

932
01:26:54,347 --> 01:26:56,189
我们到了
We're here.

933
01:27:42,266 --> 01:27:43,786
现在怎么办?
Now what?

934
01:27:44,979 --> 01:27:46,637
你告诉我
You tell me.

935
01:27:47,286 --> 01:27:49,295
我告诉你? 这是你的主意
I tell you? This was your idea.

936
01:27:49,320 --> 01:27:52,779
我不知道 我只是找到了知道的人
I don't have ideas. I just find the people who do.

937
01:27:52,804 --> 01:27:54,722
- 所以根本没有计划  - 有一个计划
- So there's no plan.  - There's a plan.

938
01:27:54,747 --> 01:27:56,981
你只是还没想到而已
You just haven't come up with it yet.

939
01:27:57,426 --> 01:28:00,387
但你得快点想
But, you should do that soon.

940
01:28:03,387 --> 01:28:05,750
真是棒极了
That's just terrific.

941
01:28:06,166 --> 01:28:08,360
给 藏起来
Here. Hide this.

942
01:28:08,933 --> 01:28:09,860
必须的
Absolutely.

943
01:28:09,885 --> 01:28:13,956
等等 那是你不让我玩的千吨级爆炸物吗?
Wait, is that the 1 kiloton detonation thingy you told me not to play with?

944
01:28:13,981 --> 01:28:15,386
此时此刻 这是我们的保障品
Right now, it's our insurance policy.

945
01:28:15,411 --> 01:28:17,791
现在他们有个在门口杀我们的好机会
There's a good chance they're gonna try and kill us right at the gate.

946
01:28:17,816 --> 01:28:20,009
我们就站在这儿?
So we're just gonna stand here?

947
01:28:20,034 --> 01:28:23,869
你想看明日世界
Well, you wanted to see Tomorrowland.

948
01:28:23,894 --> 01:28:25,800
这就是了
Here it comes.

949
01:28:51,551 --> 01:28:53,322
拿上包
Take the bag.

950
01:28:58,886 --> 01:29:01,603
- 弗兰克  - 大卫
- Frank.  - David.

951
01:29:01,793 --> 01:29:03,611
你看起来不错啊
You look well.

952
01:29:03,636 --> 01:29:05,167
岁月改变了你
Age becomes you.

953
01:29:05,192 --> 01:29:07,402
谢谢 你也该试试
Thanks. You should try it.

954
01:29:07,427 --> 01:29:10,652
我不知道 我想我会继续每天早上喝我的饮料
I don't know. I think I'll just keep drinking my shake every morning.

955
01:29:10,677 --> 01:29:12,376
现在加巧克力了
Comes in chocolate now.

956
01:29:12,401 --> 01:29:13,869
不错
Yum.

957
01:29:16,784 --> 01:29:18,424
你好 雅典娜
Hello, Athena.

958
01:29:18,449 --> 01:29:21,203
还以为你永远不会回来了
Started to think you were never coming home.

959
01:29:21,435 --> 01:29:23,720
你去哪里了?
Where oh where have you been?

960
01:29:23,721 --> 01:29:25,000
做我的工作
Doing my job.

961
01:29:25,001 --> 01:29:26,699
你的工作?
Your job?

962
01:29:26,724 --> 01:29:30,435
不好意思 我们中止你的招募协议时 说得还不清楚吗?
I'm sorry, were we not clear when we suspended your recruitment protocols?

963
01:29:30,460 --> 01:29:33,028
在你叫我该死的废物 还想拆开我的时候
I got that since when you called me bloody obsolete

964
01:29:33,053 --> 01:29:35,457
我就知道了
and tried to disassemble me.

965
01:29:36,020 --> 01:29:38,768
你从埃菲尔铁塔发射出一个古代的火箭
Well, you certainly caused quite a commotion

966
01:29:38,793 --> 01:29:43,414
一定引起了骚乱吧
by launching an antique rocket ship out of the Eiffel tower!

967
01:29:43,931 --> 01:29:45,501
在正常的情况下
Under normal circumstances,

968
01:29:45,526 --> 01:29:49,155
我们要花额外的时间来说服每个人相信那只是场特效表演...
we'd be working overtime to convince everyone it was just an elaborate hoax...

969
01:29:49,180 --> 01:29:53,748
可惜 对我们来说 现在这并不重要 对吗?
Unfortunately, for all of us, it doesn't really matter now, does it?

970
01:29:53,773 --> 01:29:55,800
为什么不重要?
Why doesn't it matter?

971
01:29:57,128 --> 01:29:59,321
你又是谁?
And who might you be?

972
01:29:59,346 --> 01:30:03,492
我... 我是凯西·纽顿
I'm... I'm Casey Newton.

973
01:30:04,280 --> 01:30:06,971
你呢... 你又是谁?
And who... who might you be?

974
01:30:07,496 --> 01:30:11,482
大卫·尼克斯 幸会
David Nix. Pleasure.

975
01:30:11,573 --> 01:30:13,910
弗兰克 很高兴能碰上面
Well, Frank, it's been wonderful catching up.

976
01:30:13,935 --> 01:30:17,113
但我们都知道 你被流放
But as we were fairly clear about the terms of your exile,

977
01:30:17,138 --> 01:30:19,303
以及反抗的结果
and the consequences of violating it,

978
01:30:19,328 --> 01:30:20,607
我不得不问
I have to ask.

979
01:30:20,632 --> 01:30:22,509
你到底来这儿干嘛?
What the hell are you doing here?

980
01:30:22,534 --> 01:30:24,831
我觉得她能修好它
I think she can fix it.

981
01:30:27,892 --> 01:30:29,279
抱歉 我...
I'm sorry, I...

982
01:30:29,304 --> 01:30:32,186
她 我觉得她能修好它 大卫
Her. I think she can fix it, David.

983
01:30:32,211 --> 01:30:33,354
等等 什么?
Wait, what?

984
01:30:33,379 --> 01:30:35,806
我一直在捕捉你的信号 每次你在这里开启
I've been pirating your signal. Every time you turn it on here,

985
01:30:35,831 --> 01:30:37,240
我都可以在那边看到
I can see it there.

986
01:30:37,265 --> 01:30:41,864
它闪了 百分比下降了 大卫
And it flickered. The percentage dropped, David.

987
01:30:42,380 --> 01:30:43,742
不可能
Impossible.

988
01:30:43,767 --> 01:30:45,641
你不相信我 我们去看看 就现在
You don't believe me, let's go find out, right now.

989
01:30:45,679 --> 01:30:48,039
不好意思 我能修好什么?
I'm sorry, what can I fix?

990
01:30:48,064 --> 01:30:54,434
世界 纽顿小姐 他觉得你能修好世界
The world, Ms. Newton. He thinks you can fix the world.

991
01:31:17,959 --> 01:31:21,254
就像一个通往地球的传送门?
Is that like a portal to Earth?

992
01:31:21,279 --> 01:31:24,241
不 这是通往地球的桥梁
No. It is a bridge way to Earth.

993
01:31:28,838 --> 01:31:32,177
欢迎回到监测中心 弗兰克
Welcome back to The Monitor, Frank.

994
01:31:32,459 --> 01:31:34,677
这东西真伟大 对吗?
It's something, isn't it?

995
01:31:35,192 --> 01:31:37,431
的确
Yeah, it's something.

996
01:31:53,159 --> 01:31:55,374
不用担心灯光
Don't worry about the light show.

997
01:31:55,399 --> 01:31:57,432
这是绝对安全的
It's perfectly safe.

998
01:32:00,013 --> 01:32:03,155
- 我要做什么吗?  - 不用
- Am I supposed to do something?  - No.

999
01:32:03,180 --> 01:32:06,315
好吧 你能再具体点吗 因为修好世界听起来有点...
Okay, can you be a bit more specific because fixing the world sounds a little...

1000
01:32:06,340 --> 01:32:08,628
做你自己就好
Just be yourself.

1001
01:32:09,099 --> 01:32:10,833
明白
Gotcha.

1002
01:32:15,307 --> 01:32:16,682
那些是什么?
What are those?

1003
01:32:16,707 --> 01:32:18,832
未来的闪影
Flashes of future.

1004
01:32:19,217 --> 01:32:21,684
那是从现在起的几秒钟
That's a few seconds from now.

1005
01:32:21,709 --> 01:32:25,707
这整座塔如漏斗般放出速子的能量
This whole tower funnels energy by tachyon.

1006
01:32:25,732 --> 01:32:28,054
一种移动速度比光还快的粒子
A particle that moves significantly faster than light.

1007
01:32:28,079 --> 01:32:30,801
大约四十年前 我们就发现了它们
We discovered them almost forty years ago.

1008
01:32:30,826 --> 01:32:34,677
你们的物理学家还在讨论它们是否存在
Your physicists are still arguing over whether they exist.

1009
01:32:37,240 --> 01:32:40,747
天啊 太晚了
Oh, dear. Too late.

1010
01:32:56,678 --> 01:32:59,285
那么 好戏上演
So. On with the show.

1011
01:32:59,900 --> 01:33:02,018
我们已经突破性地改善了接口
We've enhanced the interface significantly.

1012
01:33:02,043 --> 01:33:05,388
你们的原始算法仍在起作用
There's still functions on your original algorithm.

1013
01:33:06,413 --> 01:33:08,729
你有东西给我看 弗兰克?
You have something to show me, Frank?

1014
01:33:09,140 --> 01:33:10,782
给我看
Show me.

1015
01:33:22,266 --> 01:33:23,982
挑个地方
Pick a place.

1016
01:33:24,672 --> 01:33:26,944
- 什么?  - 一个地方 世界上的任何地方
- What?  - A location. Anywhere in the world.

1017
01:33:26,969 --> 01:33:28,426
挑一个
Pick one.

1018
01:33:30,380 --> 01:33:33,852
卡那维拉尔 卡那维拉尔角
Canaveral, Cape Canaveral.

1019
01:33:48,109 --> 01:33:49,467
小意思
Easy.

1020
01:33:49,526 --> 01:33:54,021
这个接口是从你的手 指向地球的中心
The Interface is oriented from your hands to the center of the Earth.

1021
01:33:54,047 --> 01:33:56,292
好的 明白
Okay, I got it.

1022
01:34:01,425 --> 01:34:03,587
你显然训练过她了
You've trained her, obviously.

1023
01:34:03,612 --> 01:34:05,710
我昨天才遇见她
I just met her yesterday.

1024
01:34:06,199 --> 01:34:08,133
她知道运作的原理
She knows how things work.

1025
01:34:15,785 --> 01:34:17,122
这怎么可能?
How is this possible?

1026
01:34:17,147 --> 01:34:20,115
我们身处的地方 离你这个家
We are millions of exponential deviances

1027
01:34:20,140 --> 01:34:22,318
距离成级数般地遥远
away from the dimension you call home.

1028
01:34:22,343 --> 01:34:26,153
弗兰克有了一个崇高的想法 制造出了这个机器
Frank had the noble idea of building this machine so that we could

1029
01:34:26,178 --> 01:34:28,207
能让我们保持联系
keep in touch.

1030
01:34:28,720 --> 01:34:30,716
这是三天前
This is 3 days ago.

1031
01:34:30,741 --> 01:34:32,283
相对的
Relatively.

1032
01:34:33,493 --> 01:34:36,753
那是时空连续的
That's space-time humor.

1033
01:34:38,646 --> 01:34:41,876
因为速子的速度比光还快
Because tachyons travel faster than light,

1034
01:34:41,901 --> 01:34:43,476
一旦我们控制了它们...
once we harness them...

1035
01:34:43,501 --> 01:34:46,310
你可以看到时光倒流
You can see backwards in time.

1036
01:34:46,360 --> 01:34:48,343
不只是过去
Not just backwards.

1037
01:34:50,500 --> 01:34:52,265
你在开玩笑
You're kidding.

1038
01:34:52,626 --> 01:34:53,986
不
No.

1039
01:35:18,199 --> 01:35:19,734
怎么回事?
What happened?

1040
01:35:19,759 --> 01:35:21,421
继续
Keep going.

1041
01:35:21,833 --> 01:35:23,819
再远一点
Just a little further.

1042
01:36:10,501 --> 01:36:12,231
够了
That's enough.

1043
01:36:13,260 --> 01:36:15,308
够了 孩子
That's enough, kid.

1044
01:36:20,460 --> 01:36:22,780
那是我家
That's my house.

1045
01:36:23,122 --> 01:36:26,947
要是弗兰克让你做好了准备 那就好了
Would have been nice, if Frank had prepared you for this.

1046
01:36:26,972 --> 01:36:29,894
恐怕 世界要终结了
I'm afraid the world is ending.

1047
01:36:29,919 --> 01:36:35,770
这是一定的 不可避免的 它正在到来
It is certain, it is unavoidable, and it is coming.

1048
01:36:35,973 --> 01:36:37,390
什么时候?
When?

1049
01:36:38,146 --> 01:36:40,683
现在起的58天
This is 58 days from now.

1050
01:36:40,708 --> 01:36:43,041
58天?
58 days?

1051
01:36:43,066 --> 01:36:46,523
不论是什么造成的 静态开始后 随时都会发生
Whatever caused this, could happen anytime after the static starts.

1052
01:36:46,548 --> 01:36:49,988
可能是一个月 甚至更早
It could be a month, could be sooner.

1053
01:36:59,036 --> 01:37:01,922
还在找你的闪影吗 弗兰克?
Still looking for your flicker, Frank?

1054
01:37:01,947 --> 01:37:03,922
我知道自己看见了什么
I know what I saw.

1055
01:37:05,095 --> 01:37:07,547
那你为什么没告诉任何人?
So why aren't you telling anyone?

1056
01:37:07,572 --> 01:37:12,278
整个星球就要灭亡了 而你就坐在这儿?
The whole planet is gonna die, and you're just, sitting here?

1057
01:37:12,780 --> 01:37:14,757
我们不会死的
We're not gonna die.

1058
01:37:14,782 --> 01:37:17,078
那是你的世界 不是我们的
This is your world, not ours.

1059
01:37:17,103 --> 01:37:18,761
我们在这里会安然无恙
We'll be perfectly fine here.

1060
01:37:18,772 --> 01:37:22,036
那你为什么不让大家都进来?
Then why don't you let people in?

1061
01:37:22,409 --> 01:37:25,849
- 告诉她 大卫  - 哦 弗兰克
- Tell her, David.  - Oh, Frank.

1062
01:37:26,392 --> 01:37:29,790
流放了那么些年 你还是不明白
All those years in exile and you still don't understand.

1063
01:37:29,815 --> 01:37:32,948
这些人是... 他们是受野蛮驱使的
These people are... They're driven by savagery.

1064
01:37:32,973 --> 01:37:36,006
如果我们告诉了他们这个地方
If we told them about this place,

1065
01:37:36,480 --> 01:37:39,891
同样的事情会发生在这里 发生在我们身上
then that, would happen here, to us.

1066
01:37:39,916 --> 01:37:41,481
到时 谁也活不下来
Then nothing would survive.

1067
01:37:41,506 --> 01:37:43,872
但那还没有发生
But it hasn't happened yet.

1068
01:37:43,897 --> 01:37:46,442
事实上 它已经发生了 你只是还没接受而已
Actually it has happened. You just haven't accepted it.

1069
01:37:46,467 --> 01:37:48,845
我不接受
Well I don't accept it.

1070
01:37:55,158 --> 01:37:57,551
你看见了吗? 你刚刚看见了吗?
You see that? Did you see that?

1071
01:37:57,576 --> 01:38:00,596
大卫 我知道你看到了 那意味着还有机会
David, I know that you saw that. That means that there is a chance.

1072
01:38:00,921 --> 01:38:03,076
至少还有机会
There's at least a chance.

1073
01:38:09,962 --> 01:38:11,862
进展很顺利 对吧?
That went quite well, don't you think?

1074
01:38:11,887 --> 01:38:13,394
发生了什么事情?
What happened?

1075
01:38:13,419 --> 01:38:15,512
你被驱逐了...
You're being deported...

1076
01:38:16,113 --> 01:38:17,436
又一次
again.

1077
01:38:17,461 --> 01:38:20,168
那就是尼克斯
Well, that's Nix for you.

1078
01:38:20,193 --> 01:38:22,458
毫无创新精神
No new ideas.

1079
01:38:22,580 --> 01:38:25,922
很明显你那在不可避免性中万分之一的几率
Apparently your 1/10.000 furball in the inevitability

1080
01:38:25,947 --> 01:38:29,142
不够有说服力让他改变主意
wasn't convincing enough to change his mind.

1081
01:38:34,346 --> 01:38:36,061
温柔点
Be gentle.

1082
01:38:46,719 --> 01:38:48,359
没事吧?
You okay?

1083
01:38:49,831 --> 01:38:53,640
我知道你认为我之前问你的无数问题时
I know you think somewhere in the zillions of questions that I was asking you,

1084
01:38:53,665 --> 01:38:57,493
你本可以回答 " 哦 凯西 那问题其实无关紧要 
you could've said, "Oh, Casey. Well that's stuff not really the issue

1085
01:38:57,518 --> 01:39:01,713
因为我们的未来预测机显示我们都要死了 "
because our future predicting machine says we're all gonna die."

1086
01:39:01,738 --> 01:39:03,616
他的确有暗示过
He did sort of hinted at it.

1087
01:39:03,641 --> 01:39:06,851
这地方一点希望也没有
This place has nothing to do with hope.

1088
01:39:06,876 --> 01:39:09,654
- 完全就是绝望  - 别这样 别那样说
- It's the opposite of hope.  - Come on, don't say that.

1089
01:39:09,679 --> 01:39:13,288
为什么? 你也说过了
Why not? You said it.

1090
01:39:13,583 --> 01:39:15,399
难怪你放弃了
No wonder you gave up.

1091
01:39:15,424 --> 01:39:17,593
那是在认识你之前
That's before I knew about you.

1092
01:39:17,618 --> 01:39:19,719
你真的...
You really...

1093
01:39:19,744 --> 01:39:20,894
你真的很特别
You really are special.

1094
01:39:20,919 --> 01:39:23,421
为什么你们这些人一直和我说那个?
Why do you people keep saying that to me?

1095
01:39:25,632 --> 01:39:27,683
我不特别
I'm not.

1096
01:39:31,744 --> 01:39:34,163
你给我这个干嘛? 哼
Why'd you even give me this? Hm.

1097
01:39:34,188 --> 01:39:39,447
你向我展示了一个神奇美妙的地方 但一切都是假的
You showed me a place, that was amazing and incredible, and it was a lie.

1098
01:39:40,577 --> 01:39:42,418
如果你打算把想法植入别人的头脑
If you're gonna zap an idea into people's heads,

1099
01:39:42,443 --> 01:39:44,191
你就应该确保那是真的
you should really make sure that it's the truth.

1100
01:39:44,216 --> 01:39:47,202
因为你不能这么做 你不能植入...
Because you can't do that. You can't just zap...

1101
01:39:56,963 --> 01:39:58,441
什么?
What?

1102
01:39:59,057 --> 01:40:01,574
你把想法植入别人的头脑
You zap an idea into people's heads.

1103
01:40:04,571 --> 01:40:07,128
你之前盗用了信号 你是怎么做到的?
You were pirating the signal. How?

1104
01:40:07,153 --> 01:40:08,537
- 什么?  - 在你家
- What?  - At your house,

1105
01:40:08,562 --> 01:40:10,360
有间房的电视机里 都播放着末日图像
all your TVs, your doomsday room.

1106
01:40:10,385 --> 01:40:12,288
你从接收到了监测仪发出的信号
You were boosting the feed from that Monitor thing.

1107
01:40:12,313 --> 01:40:14,076
- 你怎么做到的?  - 很简单
- How did you do that?  - No big deal.

1108
01:40:14,101 --> 01:40:17,661
它的信号太强了 随便一个蹩脚的收音机都可以接受信号
They're running so much power through it now, a ham radio can pick it up.

1109
01:40:17,686 --> 01:40:20,622
只是要找对合适的频率
It's just a matter of finding the right frequency.

1110
01:40:21,866 --> 01:40:24,168
你捕捉到了这个空间里的信号
You grabbed a signal from another dimension.

1111
01:40:24,193 --> 01:40:27,982
信号来自这个空间的监测仪 也就是说它在往我们的世界发信号
From a machine here. That means it's transmitting there.

1112
01:40:28,007 --> 01:40:31,570
也许监测仪不只是在预测未来
What if it's not just predicting the future.

1113
01:40:31,595 --> 01:40:33,052
也在传播信息
He's broadcasting it.

1114
01:40:33,077 --> 01:40:35,651
刚才我接触了这机器几分钟
When I touched this thing, for a few minutes,

1115
01:40:35,676 --> 01:40:37,334
我感觉任何事情都是可能的
it felt like anything was possible.

1116
01:40:37,359 --> 01:40:40,012
那为什么没出现好的预测?
So then why can't the opposite happen?

1117
01:40:40,037 --> 01:40:42,661
如果那个监测仪只是一个巨型接收器
What if The Monitor is just a giant pin,

1118
01:40:42,686 --> 01:40:46,548
但它不是让你积极地思考 而是让你消极地思考 它...
but instead of making you think positive, it makes you think negative. And it...

1119
01:40:48,079 --> 01:40:49,518
它在...
And it's...

1120
01:40:50,051 --> 01:40:53,573
说服全世界去喂错误的狼
convincing the whole world to feed the wrong wolf.

1121
01:40:54,236 --> 01:40:56,583
我们要把那东西关了
We need to turn that thing off.

1122
01:41:01,611 --> 01:41:03,712
是时候回家了
It's time to go home.

1123
01:41:09,302 --> 01:41:11,564
大卫 大卫
David. David.

1124
01:41:11,751 --> 01:41:14,802
- 啊! 这地方没人住 地图上也没标明  - 听我说
- Ah! It's uninhabited and uncharted.  - Listen to me.

1125
01:41:14,827 --> 01:41:17,297
看上去是你们度过余生的好地方
But it looks like a lovely place to spend your last days.

1126
01:41:19,622 --> 01:41:22,187
大卫 监测仪现在像是天线
David, The Monitor is acting as an antenna.

1127
01:41:22,212 --> 01:41:24,251
它不仅仅是在接收超光子
It isn't just receiving tachyons,

1128
01:41:24,276 --> 01:41:26,989
它还选择了其中一种可能性 让我们去相信...
it is taking a possible future and making it like...

1129
01:41:27,014 --> 01:41:29,334
它夸大其词 传播末日景象 反复灌输给我们 
Amplifying it, transmitting it, like a feedback loop.

1130
01:41:29,359 --> 01:41:32,620
这是一个主观意识的预言 就是监测仪发出的
It's a self-fulfilling prophecy that is coming from right there.

1131
01:41:32,645 --> 01:41:34,528
但它并不仅向人们展示世界末日的景象
But it's not just showing people the end of the world.

1132
01:41:34,553 --> 01:41:36,095
它还反复给人们灌输这个想法
It's giving them the idea over and over

1133
01:41:36,120 --> 01:41:38,583
- 直到人们相信末日真的会发生  - 这是一颗滴答作响的定时炸弹
- and over again until they just accept it.  - It's a ticking time bomb.

1134
01:41:38,608 --> 01:41:39,875
而我们就是点燃导火索的人
And we're the ones that lit the fuse.

1135
01:41:39,900 --> 01:41:42,712
我们还有58天来尝试和改变
We still have 58 days to try and change things,

1136
01:41:42,737 --> 01:41:45,509
但是只要那东西还在运作 就无法成功
but nothing will work as long as that thing is still on.

1137
01:41:45,533 --> 01:41:49,532
小女孩 我认为你的超光子融合的理论有一点不完整
Young lady, I'm gonna assume that your knowledge of tachyonic fusion is a little sketchy.

1138
01:41:49,557 --> 01:41:52,968
不可能关了它
Shutting it down is impossible.

1139
01:41:52,993 --> 01:41:55,345
没有"关"这个健
There is no 'Off'.

1140
01:41:55,370 --> 01:41:59,683
我告诉你它在做什么 为什么你不在乎?
I'm telling you what it's doing. Why don't you care?

1141
01:42:00,316 --> 01:42:02,894
因为正是他在操作
Because he's the one that's doing it.

1142
01:42:08,452 --> 01:42:09,944
对吗?
Right?

1143
01:42:13,708 --> 01:42:15,341
我们设想下
Let's imagine

1144
01:42:16,614 --> 01:42:19,198
如果你瞥见未来
If you glimpse the future,

1145
01:42:19,223 --> 01:42:22,616
被你看到的场景吓坏了 你会如何应对?
and were frightened by what you saw, what would you do with that information?

1146
01:42:22,641 --> 01:42:26,147
你会去找政客吗?
Would you go to politicians?

1147
01:42:26,172 --> 01:42:28,612
大企业的首脑? 你如何说服他们?
Captains of industry? And how would you convince them?

1148
01:42:28,637 --> 01:42:31,404
用数据和事实吗?
With data, facts?

1149
01:42:31,685 --> 01:42:32,841
那祝你好运
Good luck.

1150
01:42:32,866 --> 01:42:34,415
他们唯一不会做的事
The only facts they won't challenge,

1151
01:42:34,440 --> 01:42:36,523
是让经济运转
are the ones that keep the wheels greased,

1152
01:42:36,548 --> 01:42:38,341
钱财滚滚来的事实
and the dollars rolling in.

1153
01:42:38,366 --> 01:42:42,810
但是如果有办法跳过中间人
But what if there was a way of skipping the middle man,

1154
01:42:42,835 --> 01:42:47,274
直接把重要消息植入每个人的头脑
and putting the critical news directly into everyone's head.

1155
01:42:47,947 --> 01:42:51,907
大幅度灭绝的可能性会一直上升
The probability of widespread annihilation kept going up.

1156
01:42:51,932 --> 01:42:55,586
唯一让它停止的方式 就是把它展示出来
The only way to stop it, was to show it.

1157
01:42:55,611 --> 01:42:56,919
直接让人们吓个半死
To scare people straight.

1158
01:42:56,944 --> 01:43:00,681
理智的人类怎么不会被一切事物的毁灭所惊醒
What reasonable human being wouldn't be galvanized

1159
01:43:00,705 --> 01:43:04,629
那一切我们熟知而深爱的事物
by the potential destruction of everything we've ever known or loved.

1160
01:43:05,698 --> 01:43:08,316
为了拯救文明
To save civilization,

1161
01:43:08,507 --> 01:43:11,352
我要展示它的坍塌
I would show its collapse.

1162
01:43:11,761 --> 01:43:14,842
但是你觉得人们是怎么对待这个预测?
But how do you think this vision was received?

1163
01:43:14,867 --> 01:43:16,402
你认为人们是怎样回应
How do you think people responded

1164
01:43:16,426 --> 01:43:18,951
即将发生的末日景象?
to the prospect of imminent doom?

1165
01:43:18,976 --> 01:43:22,837
他们把它吞了 就像吃巧克力泡芙一样
They gobbled it up, like a chocolate eclair.

1166
01:43:22,862 --> 01:43:26,546
他们不害怕死亡 他们把它重新打包
They didn't fear their demise, they repackaged it.

1167
01:43:26,784 --> 01:43:30,824
把它当做视频游戏 电视节目 书籍和电影一样来消遣 
It can be enjoyed as video games, as TV shows, books, movies.

1168
01:43:30,849 --> 01:43:34,313
全世界全身心地接受世界末日
The entire world wholeheartedly embraced the apocalypse,

1169
01:43:34,338 --> 01:43:37,242
带着欢乐的抛弃精神朝着世界末日冲刺
and sprinted towards it with gleeful abandon.

1170
01:43:37,267 --> 01:43:41,004
同时 在你们周围 地球在崩塌
Meanwhile, your earth was crumbling all around you.

1171
01:43:41,029 --> 01:43:45,105
你们地球人肥胖和饥饿同时泛滥
You got simultaneous epidemics of obesity and starvation.

1172
01:43:45,130 --> 01:43:47,036
解释一下吧
Explain that one.

1173
01:43:47,275 --> 01:43:50,032
蜜蜂和蝴蝶开始消失
Bees and butterflies start to disappear.

1174
01:43:50,057 --> 01:43:51,797
冰川消融
The glaciers melt.

1175
01:43:51,822 --> 01:43:53,402
藻类滋蔓
Algae blooms.

1176
01:43:53,427 --> 01:43:56,821
全在你们周围 煤矿的金丝雀暴死
All around you. The coal mine canaries are dropping dead,

1177
01:43:56,845 --> 01:44:00,319
你们也不领会暗示!
and you won't take the hint!

1178
01:44:00,763 --> 01:44:04,241
每一刻 都有机会创造一个更好的未来
In every moment, there is the possibility of a better future.

1179
01:44:04,266 --> 01:44:06,209
但是你们人类不相信
But you people won't believe it.

1180
01:44:06,234 --> 01:44:07,465
因为你们不愿意相信
And because you won't believe it,

1181
01:44:07,490 --> 01:44:10,503
你们就不会采取行动 实现更好的未来
you wouldn't do what is necessary to make it a reality.

1182
01:44:10,535 --> 01:44:12,815
你们老是认为未来是可怕的
So you dwell on this so terrible future.

1183
01:44:12,840 --> 01:44:15,769
你们屈从于这个想法 因为一个理由
You resign yourselves to it. For one reason.

1184
01:44:15,794 --> 01:44:20,861
因为未来没向今天的你们索取过任何东西
Because that future doesn't ask anything of you today.

1185
01:44:22,408 --> 01:44:27,528
没错 你们看到了冰川 警告了泰坦尼克号
So. Yes, you saw the iceberg, you warned the Titanic.

1186
01:44:28,093 --> 01:44:31,616
但你们仍然驶向冰川 全速前进 
but you all just steered for it anyway. Full steam ahead.

1187
01:44:31,641 --> 01:44:33,371
为什么?
Why?

1188
01:44:34,103 --> 01:44:37,050
因为你们想下沉
Because you want to sink.

1189
01:44:37,784 --> 01:44:40,021
你们放弃了
You gave up.

1190
01:44:41,047 --> 01:44:43,303
那可不是监测仪的错
That's not The Monitor's fault.

1191
01:44:43,328 --> 01:44:45,263
而是你们人类
That's yours.

1192
01:44:48,990 --> 01:44:50,846
把他们带过去
Put them through.

1193
01:44:53,900 --> 01:44:56,238
感谢来访 弗兰克
Thanks for visiting, Frank.

1194
01:44:57,364 --> 01:44:59,958
再次见到你真的很高兴
It's genuinely nice to see you again.

1195
01:45:09,734 --> 01:45:12,588
- 你在做什么?  - 不放弃
- What are you doing?  - Not giving up.

1196
01:45:28,592 --> 01:45:30,216
小心!
Look out!

1197
01:45:35,427 --> 01:45:37,280
- 拿那东西!  - 什么东西?
- Get the thing!  - What thing?

1198
01:45:37,305 --> 01:45:40,236
我们刚来这里时我给你的东西
The thing I gave you when we first got here.

1199
01:45:42,155 --> 01:45:44,400
引爆它! 跳上平台!
Arm it! Get on the platform!

1200
01:45:51,248 --> 01:45:54,400
凯西 炸弹!
Casey, the bomb!

1201
01:45:54,401 --> 01:45:56,400
去平台上面!
Get on the platform!

1202
01:46:14,797 --> 01:46:16,355
- 现在呢?  - 引爆它!
- Now what?  - Arm it!

1203
01:46:16,379 --> 01:46:17,987
怎么引爆?
How?

1204
01:47:44,605 --> 01:47:46,397
凯西!
Casey!

1205
01:47:50,270 --> 01:47:53,977
炸弹? 炸弹在哪里?
