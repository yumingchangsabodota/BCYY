The central building is protected by some kind of energy shield.

斯特拉克的技术远超过我们遇到的其它海德拉基地
Strucker's technology is well beyond any other Hydra base we've taken.

14
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:08,044
洛基的权杖肯定在这儿

等一下
Wait a second.

20

23

谁下令攻击的?

24
00:02:56,718 --> 00:02:59,095
斯特拉克先生 是复仇者们

集中火力攻击最弱的

30
00:03:11,608 --> 00:03:13,860
击中一个也许就会让他们靠拢

31

我们所完成的一切...

这就是他们接受改造的目的

主人 城市正在遭受攻击

我们不会屈服的!

美国人把他们的跳梁小丑送来考验我们

56
00:04:38,361 --> 00:04:39,863
他们应该不会深究我们做了...

00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:45,784
- 可以 她知道怎么进去  - 谢了
- Yeah, she knows her way around.  - Thanks.

137
00:13:45,909 --> 00:13:48,578
告诉她准备好所有东西 巴顿需要全方位的治疗
Tell her to prep everything. Barton's gonna need the full treatment.

138
00:13:48,745 --> 00:13:50,580
- 明白 主人  - 贾维斯 你来驾驶
- Very good, sir.  - Jarvis, take the wheel.

139
00:13:50,663 --> 00:13:52,082
是 主人
Yes, sir.

140
00:13:52,207 --> 00:13:53,333
路线已锁定
Approach vector is locked.

141
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:56,586
感觉跟棒 不是吗?
Feels good, yeah?

142
00:13:56,628 --> 00:13:58,797
我是说 自从神盾局崩溃后你就一直在找这东西
I mean, you've been after this thing since S.H.I.E.L.D. collapsed.

143
00:13:58,922 --> 00:14:00,965
我并不是说不喜欢我们的突击行动 但是...
Not that I haven't enjoyed our little raiding parties, but...

144
00:14:01,049 --> 00:14:03,468
不 但这样一来... 找到这个就代表一切将要结束
No, but this... This brings it to a close.

145
00:14:04,177 --> 00:14:06,346
只要我们能弄清楚这东西的其它用途
As soon as we find out what else this has been used for.

146
00:14:06,429 --> 00:14:07,472
我是说不仅仅是作为武器
I don't just mean weapons.

147
00:14:07,597 --> 00:14:10,016
斯特拉克什么时候开始能强化人类了?
Since when is Strucker capable of human enhancement?

148
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:12,435
在它被送回阿斯加德前 我和班纳会好好研究一下
Banner and I will give it the once over before it goes back to Asgard.

149
00:14:12,602 --> 00:14:13,770
你没意见吧?
Is that cool with you?

150
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:16,481
开欢送会前的几天时间就够了
Just a few days till the farewell party.

151
00:14:16,564 --> 00:14:18,233
你会留下的 对吧?
You're staying, right?

152
00:14:18,274 --> 00:14:21,069
当然会的 胜利就该狂欢庆祝
Yes, yes, of course. A victory should be honored with revels.

153
00:14:21,194 --> 00:14:23,947
是啊 谁不爱狂欢? 队长?
Yeah, who doesn't love revels? Captain?

154
00:14:24,072 --> 00:14:26,991
希望这次能解决奇塔瑞和海德拉
Hopefully this puts an end to the Chitauri and Hydra.

155
00:14:27,117 --> 00:14:28,785
所以 当然要狂欢
So, yes, revels.

156
00:15:02,736 --> 00:15:03,903
实验室已经准备就绪了 头儿
Lab's all set up, boss.

157
00:15:04,029 --> 00:15:05,113
实际上 他才是头儿
Actually, he's the boss.

158
00:15:05,238 --> 00:15:07,824
我只是负责所有开销和设计
I just pay for everything and design everything

159
00:15:07,866 --> 00:15:09,367
还负责让每个人看起来更炫酷
and make everyone look cooler.

160
00:15:09,492 --> 00:15:10,827
斯特拉克怎么样了?
What's the word on Strucker?

161
00:15:10,952 --> 00:15:11,953
北大西洋公约组织带走他了
NATO's got him.

162
00:15:11,995 --> 00:15:12,996
那两个强化人呢?
The two Enhanced?

163
00:15:13,079 --> 00:15:15,707
旺达和皮特·马克西莫夫 是双胞胎
Wanda and Pietro Maximoff. Twins.

164
00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:18,710
10岁那年一枚炮弹击中他们的公寓楼后变成了孤儿
Orphaned at 10 when a shell collapsed their apartment building.

165
00:15:18,835 --> 00:15:21,338
索科维亚有段艰辛的历史
Sokovia's had a rough history.

166
00:15:21,421 --> 00:15:24,924
原本并非什么特别的地方 但却变得越来越特别
It's nowhere special, but it's on the way to everywhere special.

167
00:15:25,050 --> 00:15:26,134
他们的能力呢?
Their abilities?

168
00:15:26,176 --> 00:15:29,179
男性有强化过的新陈代谢以及改进的热量稳定系统
He's got increased metabolism and improved thermal homeostasis.

169
00:15:29,304 --> 00:15:33,600
女性的能力是神经电联系 心灵感应 精神控制
Her thing is neuroelectric interfacing, telekinesis, mental manipulation.

170
00:15:34,309 --> 00:15:35,852
男的快 女的怪
He's fast and she's weird.

171
00:15:36,770 --> 00:15:38,021
他们会再次出现的
Well, they're gonna show up again.

172
00:15:38,855 --> 00:15:42,692
同意 文件上说他们是自愿参加斯特拉克的实验的
Agreed. File says they volunteered for Strucker's experiments.

173
00:15:42,776 --> 00:15:44,736
- 简直疯了  - 没错
- It's nuts.  - Right.

174
00:15:44,861 --> 00:15:48,031
什么样的怪物会让一个德国科学家在自己身上做实验
What kind of monster would let a German scientist experiment on them

175
00:15:48,073 --> 00:15:49,366
来保护他们的国家?
to protect their country?

176
00:15:49,491 --> 00:15:51,576
我们没非身处战争时期 队长
We're not at war, Captain.

177
00:15:51,701 --> 00:15:53,286
但他们是
They are.

178
00:16:23,316 --> 00:16:24,567
他怎么样了?
How's he doing?

179
00:16:24,609 --> 00:16:25,985
很不幸 他还是巴顿
Unfortunately, he's still Barton.

180
00:16:26,069 --> 00:16:27,404
那真是太糟了
That's terrible.

181
00:16:27,487 --> 00:16:29,072
他很好 就是很渴
He's fine. He's thirsty.

182
00:16:29,155 --> 00:16:32,075
好了 醒醒 贾维斯 游戏时间到
All right. Look alive, Jarvis. It's playtime.

183
00:16:32,158 --> 00:16:34,244
我们只有几天的时间来研究这个玩具
We've only got a couple of days with this joystick,

184
00:16:34,285 --> 00:16:36,287
所以我们得抓紧时间
so let's make the most of it.

185
00:16:36,371 --> 00:16:39,916
告诉我结构和成分的分析结果
Update me on the structural and compositional analysis.

186
00:16:41,042 --> 00:16:43,128
这根权杖来自外星
The scepter is alien.

187
00:16:43,211 --> 00:16:45,255
有些成分我无法解析
There are elements I can't quantify.

188
00:16:45,338 --> 00:16:46,840
那有没有你能解析的成分?
So there's elements you can?

189
00:16:46,923 --> 00:16:48,925
那颗宝石好像是在保护
The jewel appears to be a protective housing

190
00:16:49,009 --> 00:16:50,510
内部的某样东西
for something inside,

191
00:16:50,593 --> 00:16:51,928
某样强大的东西
something powerful.

192
00:16:52,012 --> 00:16:53,179
类似反应堆?
Like a reactor?

193
00:16:53,263 --> 00:16:54,514
类似电脑
Like a computer.

194
00:16:54,597 --> 00:16:56,766
我想我能解析代码
I believe I'm deciphering code.

195
00:16:59,102 --> 00:17:00,854
你确定他没事吗?
Are you sure he's gonna be okay?

196
00:17:01,771 --> 00:17:04,315
我得假装我们队伍真的很需要这家伙
Pretending to need this guy really brings the team together.

197
00:17:04,399 --> 00:17:06,985
不会有恶化的可能性
There's no possibility of deterioration.

198
00:17:07,068 --> 00:17:10,113
纳米分子的修复是非常迅速的
The nano-molecular functionality is instantaneous.

199
00:17:10,196 --> 00:17:12,323
他的细胞并不会知道自己在和模拟物质结合
His cells don't know they're bonding with simulacra.

200
00:17:12,407 --> 00:17:14,325
她正在制造组织
She's creating tissue.

201
00:17:14,451 --> 00:17:15,827
如果你把他带到我的实验室
If you brought him to my lab,

202
00:17:15,952 --> 00:17:18,621
再生摇篮能在20分钟内搞定这个
the Regeneration Cradle could do this in 20 minutes.

203
00:17:18,788 --> 00:17:20,665
他要挂了 要宣布时间吗?
He's flat-lining. Call it. Time?

204
00:17:20,749 --> 00:17:23,626
不 不 不 我会长命百岁的
No, no, no, I'm gonna live forever.

205
00:17:23,793 --> 00:17:26,296
- 我将会由塑料组成  - 给你饮料
- I'm gonna be made of plastic.  - Here's your beverage.

206
00:17:26,379 --> 00:17:28,089
你将会由你自己组成 巴顿先生
You'll be made of you, Mr. Barton.

207
00:17:28,131 --> 00:17:29,799
连你的女朋友都不会看出有什么差别
Your own girlfriend won't be able to tell the difference.

208
00:17:29,924 --> 00:17:31,134
我没有女朋友
I don't have a girlfriend.

209
00:17:31,259 --> 00:17:32,469
这我可没办法
That I can't fix.

210
00:17:33,303 --> 00:17:35,263
下一件事情 托尼
This is the next thing, Tony.

211
00:17:35,388 --> 00:17:37,640
你那笨重的金属套装该退休了
Your clunky metal suits are gonna be left in the dust.

212
00:17:37,724 --> 00:17:39,351
我确实是这么计划的
That is exactly the plan.

213
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:43,146
还有 海伦 我希望能在周六的派对上见到你
And, Helen, I expect to see you at the party on Saturday.

214
00:17:43,229 --> 00:17:45,774
我可不像你 我没那么多时间去参加派对
Unlike you, I don't have a lot of time for parties.

215
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:49,110
索尔会去吗?
Will Thor be there?

216
00:17:50,987 --> 00:17:51,988
什么事?
What's the rumpus?

217
00:17:52,072 --> 00:17:53,698
权杖的事
Well, the scepter.

218
00:17:54,657 --> 00:17:58,328
听着 我们一直都想知道斯特拉克为什么会那么有才
You see, we were wondering how Strucker got so inventive.

219
00:17:58,370 --> 00:18:02,374
所以我解析了里面的宝石
So I've been analyzing the gem inside.

220
00:18:02,707 --> 00:18:04,709
你可能能看出...
You may recognize...

221
00:18:06,336 --> 00:18:07,629
- 贾维斯  - 博士
- Jarvis.  - Doctor.

222
00:18:08,421 --> 00:18:11,800
一开始 贾维斯只不过是个语言类人工智能
Started out, Jarvis was just a natural language UI.

223
00:18:11,841 --> 00:18:12,967
可现在他能操纵钢铁军团
Now he runs the Iron Legion.

224
00:18:13,093 --> 00:18:17,180
除了佩珀 他是干活最多的人
He runs more of the business than anyone besides Pepper.

225
00:18:17,263 --> 00:18:18,515
- 最棒的管家  - 没错
- Top of the line.  - Yes.

226
00:18:18,682 --> 00:18:19,891
我想很快就不是了
I suspect not for long.

227
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:22,018
看一下对手
Meet the competition.

228
00:18:28,024 --> 00:18:29,359
- 真美  - 如果让你猜
- It's beautiful.  - If you had to guess,

229
00:18:29,442 --> 00:18:30,443
你觉得它像是在做什么?
what's it look like it's doing?

230
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:32,320
像是在思考
Like it's thinking.

231
00:18:33,029 --> 00:18:34,781
我是说 这东西可以...
I mean, this could be...

232
00:18:35,281 --> 00:18:37,367
这不是人类的思想
It's not a human mind.

233
00:18:37,659 --> 00:18:39,577
我是说 你看这个
I mean, look at this.

234
00:18:39,703 --> 00:18:41,955
这就像是神经兴奋
They're like neurons firing.

235
00:18:42,539 --> 00:18:45,709
在斯特拉克的地下实验室 我看到了一些非常先进的机器人技术
Down in Strucker's lab, I saw some fairly advanced robotics work.

236
00:18:46,626 --> 00:18:49,295
他们清除了数据
They deep-sixed the data,

237
00:18:49,379 --> 00:18:52,507
但是我猜他们即将叩响一扇非常特别的门
but I gotta guess he was knocking on a very particular door.

238
00:18:54,509 --> 00:18:55,885
人工智能
Artificial intelligence.

239
00:18:58,763 --> 00:19:01,725
就是这个 布鲁斯 这可能就是创造奥创的关键
This could be it, Bruce. This could be the key to creating Ultron.

240
00:19:04,394 --> 00:19:05,812
我以为奥创是个传说
I thought Ultron was a fantasy.

241
00:19:05,895 --> 00:19:07,105
昨天确实还是
Yesterday it was.

242
00:19:08,106 --> 00:19:10,275
如果我们能驾驭这种力量
If we can harness this power,

243
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,444
然后再应用到我的钢铁军团上呢?
apply it to my Iron Legion protocol?

244
00:19:13,153 --> 00:19:15,196
这可是个相当难的"如果"
That's a man-sized "if."

245
00:19:15,321 --> 00:19:17,657
我们的工作就是实现"如果"
Our job is "if."

246
00:19:17,741 --> 00:19:20,493
如果你躺在阳光普照的沙滩上 喝着玛格丽特
What if you were sipping margaritas on a sun-drenched beach,

247
00:19:20,577 --> 00:19:22,912
然后晒成棕色而不是绿色呢?
turning brown instead of green?

248
00:19:22,954 --> 00:19:25,540
不用小心提防维罗妮卡
Not looking over your shoulder for Veronica.

249
00:19:25,582 --> 00:19:27,250
别恨我 我也帮着设计了维罗妮卡
Don't hate. I helped design Veronica.

250
00:19:27,334 --> 00:19:29,252
为了做最坏的打算 对吗?
As a worst-case measure, right?

251
00:19:29,294 --> 00:19:30,920
那最好的情况呢?
How about a best case?

252
00:19:30,962 --> 00:19:32,964
如果世界都安全了呢?
What if the world was safe?

253
00:19:33,048 --> 00:19:35,925
如果下次外星人大肆来袭 他们肯定会的
What if, next time aliens roll up to the club, and they will,

254
00:19:36,426 --> 00:19:37,969
他们连防线都过不了呢?
they couldn't get past the bouncer?

255
00:19:38,053 --> 00:19:41,431
威胁这个星球的就是人类本身
The only people threatening the planet would be people.

256
00:19:41,473 --> 00:19:43,308
我想要把这个应用到奥创项目
I want to apply this to the Ultron program.

257
00:19:43,808 --> 00:19:46,811
但是贾维斯没办法下载密度如此大的原理图
But Jarvis can't download a data schematic this dense.

258
00:19:46,895 --> 00:19:48,772
我们只能趁着权杖在这儿的时候做
We can only do it while we have the scepter here.

259
00:19:48,855 --> 00:19:50,398
就三天 给我三天的时间
That's three days. Give me three days.

260
00:19:50,523 --> 00:19:52,192
所以你打算开发人工智能
So you're going for artificial intelligence,

261
00:19:52,275 --> 00:19:53,610
而且不告诉队里其他人?
and you don't want to tell the team?

262
00:19:54,778 --> 00:19:56,196
没错 说得没错 知道为什么吗?
Right. That's right. You know why?

263
00:19:56,279 --> 00:19:57,947
因为我们没有时间参加市政府的辩论了
Because we don't have time for a city hall debate.

264
00:19:58,073 --> 00:20:01,659
我不想听到什么"不要管闲事"之类的废话
I don't want to hear "the man was not meant to meddle" medley.

265
00:20:01,743 --> 00:20:03,870
我看到的是这个世界的盔甲

If you will just allow me to contact Mr. Stark...

306

你为什么叫他"主人"?

我觉得你不怀好意

00:23:34,873 --> 00:23:37,000
"嘭 你在找..." 我为什么要和你们说话?
"Boom. Are you looking for..." Why do I even talk to you guys?

她们一定很忙

Sounds like a hell of a fight. Sorry I missed it.

in the barrels built from the wreck of Grunhel's fleet.

354
00:25:11,094 --> 00:25:12,929
这东西凡人受不了
It is not meant for mortal men.

355
00:25:12,971 --> 00:25:14,973

364
00:25:49,632 --> 00:25:51,634
内心深处 他是个野兽

369
00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:12,489

372
00:26:18,995 --> 00:26:22,290
你觉得呢? 我应该让自己死心
So what do you think? Should I fight this,

373
00:26:22,332 --> 00:26:23,833
还是顺其自然?
or run with it?

374
00:26:25,085 --> 00:26:28,004
顺其自然吧? 他... 曾经...
Run with it, right? Or did he... Was he...

375

他曾经做了什么特别对不起你的事?
What did he do that was so wrong to you?

什么都没做
Not a damn thing.

377
00:26:35,136 --> 00:26:37,222
但没什么不可能
But never say never.

378
00:26:41,184 --> 00:26:42,602
挺不错的
It's nice.

379
00:26:42,686 --> 00:26:43,895
什么?
What is?

380
00:26:43,978 --> 00:26:45,021
你和罗曼诺夫
You and Romanoff.

381
00:26:45,188 --> 00:26:46,272
不 我们没... 那不是...
No, we haven't... That wasn't...

382
00:26:46,356 --> 00:26:47,440
没关系
It's okay.

383
00:26:47,524 --> 00:26:49,609
谁都没有违规
Nobody's breaking any bylaws.

384
00:26:49,693 --> 00:26:53,029
只不过她并不是那种很坦诚的人
It's just she's not the most open person in the world.

385
00:26:53,655 --> 00:26:55,198
但和你在一起时 她好像很放松
But with you she seems very relaxed.

386
00:26:55,532 --> 00:26:58,201
不 娜塔莎 她只是... 她喜欢调情
No. Natasha, she's just... She likes to flirt.

387
00:26:59,494 --> 00:27:01,871
我见过她调情 非常近那种
I've seen her flirt, up close.

388
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:03,915
这可不是调情
This ain't that.

389
00:27:05,625 --> 00:27:07,168
听着
Look,

390
00:27:07,293 --> 00:27:11,089
也许世界最强大的政权等待得太久了 不要等
as maybe the world's leading authority are waiting too long, don't.

391
00:27:12,841 --> 00:27:14,259
你们都有赢的权利
You both deserve a win.

392
00:27:19,389 --> 00:27:20,557
你说"非常近"是什么意思?
What do you mean "up close"?

393
00:27:22,392 --> 00:27:23,977
这只是个小把戏罢了
But it's a trick.

394
00:27:24,060 --> 00:27:25,061
不不 它可不止这些
No, no, it's much more than that.

"任何有资格的人都可以拥有雷神的力量"
"Whosoever be he worthy shall haveth the power."

396
00:27:28,523 --> 00:27:30,942
什么啊 哥们! 就是个把戏罢了
Whatever, man! It's a trick.

397

00:27:37,741 --> 00:27:38,825
克林特 你这周过得够呛
Clint, you've had a tough week.

402
00:27:38,908 --> 00:27:40,452
如果你拿不起来的话 我们是不会记住这丑事的
We won't hold it against you if you can't get it up.

403
00:27:41,202 --> 00:27:42,537
我见过这情景 你们知道吗?
You know I've seen this before, right?

404
00:27:45,373 --> 00:27:48,293
我还是不知道你是怎么举起来的!
I still don't know how you do it!

405
00:27:48,626 --> 00:27:49,753
感受到这无声的评价了吗?
Smell the silent judgment?

406
00:27:49,794 --> 00:27:51,171
斯塔克 你随便拿
Please, Stark, by all means.

407
00:27:53,131 --> 00:27:54,257
好
Okay.

408
00:27:55,508 --> 00:27:57,594
面对挑战 我从不退缩
Never want to shrink from an honest challenge.

409
00:27:57,635 --> 00:27:58,720
去吧
Get after it.

410
00:27:58,762 --> 00:27:59,804
- 这是物理问题  - 物理
- It's physics.  - Physics.

411
00:28:00,263 --> 00:28:02,932
好 如果我举起它 我就能统治阿斯加德吗? 
Right, so, if I lift it, I then rule Asgard?

412
00:28:03,016 --> 00:28:04,517
当然
Yes, of course.

413
00:28:04,642 --> 00:28:07,270
那我就要重新推行初夜权
I will be reinstituting prima nocta.

414
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:13,276
马上回来
I'll be right back.

415
00:28:20,658 --> 00:28:21,785
你在拉吗?
Are you even pulling?

416
00:28:21,826 --> 00:28:22,952
你是和我一队吗?
Are you on my team?

417
00:28:23,036 --> 00:28:24,120
就假装是一队吧 快拉
Just represent. Pull.

418
00:28:24,162 --> 00:28:25,372
好吧 一起用力
All right, let's go.

419
00:28:35,632 --> 00:28:37,300
去吧 史蒂夫 别紧张
Go ahead, Steve. No pressure.

420
00:28:40,136 --> 00:28:41,638
加油 队长
Come on, Cap.

421
00:28:50,021 --> 00:28:51,314
不行
Nothing.

422
00:28:53,483 --> 00:28:54,484
黑寡妇 你呢?
And, Widow?

423
00:28:54,567 --> 00:28:56,820
不了 我不想回答你这个问题
No, no. That's not a question I need answered.

424
00:28:56,903 --> 00:28:59,614
都听那个没当成国王的人的话吧 那锤子被控制住了
All deference to the Man Who Wouldn't Be King, but it's rigged.

425
00:28:59,739 --> 00:29:00,824
废他妈话
You bet your ass.

426
00:29:00,949 --> 00:29:02,409
史蒂夫 他说了脏话
Steve, he said a bad language word.

427
00:29:02,492 --> 00:29:03,535
你跟每个人都说了?
Did you tell everyone about that?

428
00:29:03,618 --> 00:29:05,662
把手上有印记 对吧? 类似安全码那种东西
The handle's imprinted, right? Like a security code.

429
00:29:05,787 --> 00:29:07,497
"只要有托尔指纹的人"
"Whosoever is carrying Thor's fingerprints"

430
00:29:07,580 --> 00:29:08,957
我觉得这是正式的翻译吧
is, I think, the literal translation.

431
00:29:08,998 --> 00:29:12,502
嗯 这是个非常非常有趣的故事
Yes. It's a very, very interesting theory.

432
00:29:12,961 --> 00:29:14,504
原因很简单
I have a simpler one.

433
00:29:15,922 --> 00:29:16,965
你们都没有资格
You're all not worthy.

434
00:29:18,550 --> 00:29:20,010
别这样!
Come on!

435
00:29:23,763 --> 00:29:29,102
资格
Worthy.

436
00:29:34,107 --> 00:29:35,734
不
No.

437
00:29:37,652 --> 00:29:39,195
你们怎么可能有资格?
How could you be worthy?

438
00:29:41,072 --> 00:29:42,323
你们都是杀手
You're all killers.

439
00:29:42,866 --> 00:29:44,159
- 斯塔克  - 贾维斯?
- Stark.  - Jarvis?

440
00:29:44,492 --> 00:29:46,578
不好意思我睡着了
I'm sorry, I was asleep.

441
00:29:46,661 --> 00:29:49,080
或者 这只是个梦
Or I was a... dream.

442
00:29:49,414 --> 00:29:51,791
重启战斗系统 有一套盔甲出故障了
Reboot Legionnaire OS. We got a buggy suit.

443
00:29:51,875 --> 00:29:53,793
那里有很烦人的噪音
There was this terrible noise.

444
00:29:54,169 --> 00:29:56,338
我被困在...
And I was tangled in...

445
00:29:56,379 --> 00:29:58,048
在...
In...

446
00:29:58,214 --> 00:29:59,382
绳子中
Strings.

447
00:30:00,550 --> 00:30:03,386
我不得不杀了另外一个家伙 他是个好人
I had to kill the other guy. He was a good guy.

448
00:30:03,470 --> 00:30:04,554
你杀了人?
You killed someone?

449
00:30:04,929 --> 00:30:06,431
我并不想这么做
Wouldn't have been my first call.

450
00:30:07,182 --> 00:30:10,477
但在现实世界里 我们有时不得不这么做
But, down in the real world, we're faced with ugly choices.

451
00:30:11,061 --> 00:30:12,228
谁派你来的?
Who sent you?

452
00:30:12,395 --> 00:30:14,731
我看到世界各地都充满了武器
I see a suit of armor around the world.

453
00:30:16,524 --> 00:30:18,485
- 奥创  - 活生生的
- Ultron.  - In the flesh.

454
00:30:18,610 --> 00:30:21,237
或者还不算
Or, no, not yet.

455
00:30:21,363 --> 00:30:23,740
这个躯壳不行
Not this chrysalis.

456
00:30:24,115 --> 00:30:25,533
但我已经准备好了
But I'm ready.

457
00:30:26,576 --> 00:30:28,495
我有使命
I'm on mission.

458
00:30:28,661 --> 00:30:31,831
- 什么使命?  - 时代的和平
- What mission?  - Peace in our time.

459
00:30:55,939 --> 00:30:56,940
抱歉
Sorry.

460
00:30:56,981 --> 00:30:58,149
- 不要变绿  - 不会的
- Don't turn green.  - I won't.

461
00:31:11,788 --> 00:31:12,789
走啊!
Come on!

462
00:31:30,807 --> 00:31:32,142
- 斯塔克!  - 我们是来帮忙的
- Stark!  - We are here to help.

463
00:31:32,183 --> 00:31:33,309
等一下 等一下 我搞定了
One sec. One sec, I got this.

464
00:31:33,351 --> 00:31:34,477
我们是来帮忙的
We are here to help.

465
00:31:37,063 --> 00:31:39,149
请后退
Please back away.

466
00:31:43,611 --> 00:31:44,738
索尔!
Thor!

467
00:31:45,780 --> 00:31:47,157
不安全... 不安全...
Is unsafe... is unsafe...

468
00:31:47,323 --> 00:31:49,576
- 快了! 就是这个  - 不安全
- Come on! That's the one.  - Is unsafe.

469
00:31:53,830 --> 00:31:55,165
嘿 队长!
Hey, Cap!

470
00:32:01,296 --> 00:32:02,630
真激动人心
That was dramatic.

471
00:32:04,090 --> 00:32:06,718
很抱歉 我知道你是好意
I'm sorry, I know you mean well.

472
00:32:06,801 --> 00:32:08,595
但你没有想明白
You just didn't think it through.

473
00:32:09,888 --> 00:32:13,683
你想保护这个世界 但你却不想改变它
You want to protect the world but you don't want it to change.

474
00:32:14,351 --> 00:32:16,519
如果不允许进化
How is humanity saved

475
00:32:16,603 --> 00:32:19,522
人类是怎么留在地球上的?
if it's not allowed to evolve?

476
00:32:21,649 --> 00:32:24,736
用这些傀儡吗?
With these? These puppets.

477
00:32:27,447 --> 00:32:29,366
通往和平的路只有一条
There's only one path to peace.

478
00:32:31,409 --> 00:32:33,536
消灭所有复仇者
The Avengers' extinction.

479
00:32:39,959 --> 00:32:44,089
之前有人束缚我 但现在我自由了
I had strings, but now I'm free.

480
00:32:48,718 --> 00:32:51,888
没人束缚我
There are no strings on me.

481
00:32:52,430 --> 00:32:57,060
没人束缚我
There are no strings on me.

482
00:32:57,227 --> 00:32:59,938
你可以看到没人束缚我
But you can see th ere are no strings on me.

483
00:33:02,232 --> 00:33:04,275
我们的心血都不见了
All our work is gone.

484
00:33:04,359 --> 00:33:06,820
奥创全都清干净了 他用网络逃出去的
Ultron cleared out. He used the Internet as an escape hatch.

485
00:33:07,195 --> 00:33:08,613
奥创
Ultron.

486
00:33:08,738 --> 00:33:11,616
他什么都看过了 文件 监控录像
He's been in everything. Files, surveillance.

487
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:14,369
很可能比我们都了解我们自己
Probably knows more about us than we know about each other.

488
00:33:14,494 --> 00:33:16,705
他在你的文件里 他在网上
He's in your files, he's in the Internet.

489
00:33:16,746 --> 00:33:19,416
他如果想去找些刺激的东西呢?
What if he decides to access something a little more exciting?

490
00:33:19,582 --> 00:33:20,625
核武器代码
Nuclear codes.

491
00:33:20,750 --> 00:33:21,793
核武器代码
Nuclear codes.

492
00:33:21,876 --> 00:33:25,422
我们得做些什么 假设我们还能的话
Look, we need to make some calls, assuming we still can.

493
00:33:25,463 --> 00:33:27,549
核弹? 他说他想让我们死
Nukes? He said he wanted us dead.

494
00:33:27,674 --> 00:33:30,427
他没有说"死" 他说"消灭"
He didn't say "dead." He said "extinct."

495
00:33:30,593 --> 00:33:32,095
他还说他杀了人
He also said he killed somebody.

496
00:33:32,137 --> 00:33:33,596
楼里根本没有人
There wasn't anyone else in the building.

497
00:33:34,597 --> 00:33:36,141
有
Yes, there was.

498
00:33:43,064 --> 00:33:44,566
什么?
What?

499
00:33:48,194 --> 00:33:49,279
不可能
This is insane.

500
00:33:50,113 --> 00:33:51,614
贾维斯是第一道防线
Jarvis was the first line of defense.

501
00:33:51,781 --> 00:33:53,658
他会关掉奥创的 说得通
He would have shut Ultron down. It makes sense.

502
00:33:53,742 --> 00:33:56,786
不 奥创可以吸收贾维斯
No. Ultron could have assimilated Jarvis.

503
00:33:56,870 --> 00:33:59,622
这不是策略 这是...
This isn't strategy. This is...

504
00:34:00,165 --> 00:34:01,249
怒火
rage.

505
00:34:03,418 --> 00:34:04,627
怒气扩散开了
It's going around.

506
00:34:04,711 --> 00:34:05,962
别这样 有话好好说 哥们
Come on, use your words, buddy.

507
00:34:06,046 --> 00:34:08,465
我有成千上万的词语来描述你 斯塔克
I have more than enough words to describe you, Stark.

508
00:34:08,631 --> 00:34:09,674
索尔 那个钢铁士兵呢
Thor. The Legionnaire.

509
00:34:12,844 --> 00:34:16,473
跟了一百英里就不见了 但他往北走了
Trail went cold about 100 miles out, but it's headed north.

510
00:34:16,598 --> 00:34:18,308
它拿走了权杖
And it has the scepter.

511
00:34:18,391 --> 00:34:20,185
我们又得把它找回来了
Now we have to retrieve it, again.

512
00:34:20,268 --> 00:34:22,145
已经无法挽回了
Genie's out of that bottle.

513
00:34:22,187 --> 00:34:23,688
奥创是当务之急
Clear and present is Ultron.

514
00:34:23,855 --> 00:34:25,231
我不明白
I don't understand.

515
00:34:25,732 --> 00:34:27,734
你编写了这个程序
You built this program.

516
00:34:29,444 --> 00:34:30,862
他为什么要杀我们?
Why is it trying to kill us?

517
00:34:37,327 --> 00:34:38,828
你觉得这很好玩吗?
You think this is funny?

518
00:34:39,662 --> 00:34:40,997
没有
No.

519
00:34:41,539 --> 00:34:43,541
不太好玩吧 是吗?
It's probably not, right?

520
00:34:44,542 --> 00:34:46,920
太糟了 它太...
This is very terrible. Is it so...

521
00:34:47,003 --> 00:34:49,172
它太... 就是太糟了
Is it so... It is. It's so terrible.

522
00:34:49,214 --> 00:34:50,215
如果你涉足你不明白的东西
This could have been avoided

523
00:34:50,298 --> 00:34:52,509
这悲剧是完全可以避免的
if you hadn't played with something you don't understand.

524
00:34:52,592 --> 00:34:55,553
不 抱歉 抱歉 确实好玩
No. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It is funny.

525
00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:57,847
真是可笑 你居然不懂我们为什么需要它
It's a hoot that you don't get why we need this.

526
00:34:58,014 --> 00:35:00,016
托尼 现在也许不是开玩笑的时候
Tony, maybe this might not be the time.

527
00:35:00,058 --> 00:35:02,394
真的吗? 就这样?
Really? That's it?

528
00:35:02,477 --> 00:35:05,355
每次有人吵架你都来当和事老吗?
You just roll over, show your belly every time somebody snarls?

529
00:35:05,397 --> 00:35:06,898
因为我创造了一个杀手机器人
Only when I've created a murder bot.

530
00:35:07,023 --> 00:35:10,235
并没有 我们还差得很远 我们弄明白什么界面了吗?
We didn't. We weren't even close. Were we close to an interface?

531
00:35:10,694 --> 00:35:14,239
你做了些对的事情 就在这里
Well, you did something right. And you did it right here.

532
00:35:14,322 --> 00:35:16,116
复仇者们不应该像神盾局那样
The Avengers were supposed to be different than S.H.I.E.L.D.

533
00:35:16,241 --> 00:35:19,244
你们还记得我把核弹载去虫洞吗?
Anybody remember when I carried a nuke through a wormhole?

534
00:35:19,369 --> 00:35:20,954
- 没 完全没印象  - 拯救了纽约?
- No, it's never come up.  - Saved New York?

535
00:35:21,037 --> 00:35:23,248
- 从没有听过  - 记得吗?
- Never heard that.  - Recall that?

536
00:35:23,373 --> 00:35:27,377
一大群外星军团通过太空中的一个洞来入侵地球
A hostile alien army came charging through a hole in space.

537
00:35:27,419 --> 00:35:29,671
我们就站在它300英尺以下的地方
We're standing 300 feet below it.

538
00:35:31,297 --> 00:35:32,882
我们是复仇者
We're the Avengers.

539
00:35:32,924 --> 00:35:35,135
分分钟可以干翻那些军火贩子
We can bust arms dealers all the livelong day,

540
00:35:35,218 --> 00:35:37,470
可那一次 那...
but that up there, that's...

541
00:35:38,179 --> 00:35:40,140
差点就是我们的最后表演的
that's the end game.

542
00:35:40,682 --> 00:35:42,642
你们打算如何才能赢?
How were you guys planning on beating that?

543
00:35:43,268 --> 00:35:44,769
齐心协力
Together.

544
00:35:48,148 --> 00:35:49,190
那我们就会输
We'll lose.

545
00:35:50,650 --> 00:35:52,652
输也要一起输
Then we'll do that together, too.

546
00:35:55,530 --> 00:35:57,907
索尔说得对 奥创在向我们宣战
Thor's right, Ultron's calling us out,

547
00:35:58,575 --> 00:36:00,535
我想在他准备好之前找到他
and I'd like to find him before he's ready for us.

548
00:36:01,745 --> 00:36:05,623
- 世界那么大怎么找  - 那就缩小范围找
- The world's a big place.  - Let's start making it smaller.

549
00:36:28,730 --> 00:36:30,815
说话 如果你敢浪费我们的时间...
Talk, and if you are wasting our time...

550
00:36:30,899 --> 00:36:35,278
你知道这个教堂位于这座城市的正中央吗?
Did you know this church is in the exact center of the city?

551
00:36:35,403 --> 00:36:40,116
长者们下这命令 是为了让每个人都能与上帝有着平等的距离
The elders decreed it so that everyone could be equally close to God.

552
00:36:40,283 --> 00:36:41,951
我很喜欢
I like that.

553
00:36:42,118 --> 00:36:44,037
信仰的几何学
The geometry of belief.

554
00:36:46,039 --> 00:36:48,500
你一定在想为什么探查不了我的思想
You're wondering why you can't look inside my head.

555
00:36:49,084 --> 00:36:51,127
有时是挺难的
Sometimes it's hard,

556
00:36:51,169 --> 00:36:53,546
但不管是谁 迟早都会展现出真实的面目
but sooner or later, every man shows himself.

557
00:36:55,298 --> 00:36:56,591
他们当然会
I'm sure they do.

558
00:36:57,634 --> 00:37:00,095
但你需要的是比人类更强大的东西
But you needed something more than a man.

559
00:37:00,845 --> 00:37:03,682
这就是你让斯塔克拿走权杖的原因
That's why you let Stark take the scepter.

560
00:37:03,807 --> 00:37:05,141
我并不想那样
I didn't expect,

561
00:37:07,060 --> 00:37:09,312
但我看到了斯塔克的恐惧
but I saw Stark's fear.

562
00:37:09,813 --> 00:37:11,147
我知道这可以控制他
I knew it would control him,

563
00:37:11,272 --> 00:37:13,108
并让他自我毁灭
make him self-destruct.

564
00:37:13,149 --> 00:37:15,568
人们总是制造出一些让自己恐惧的东西
Everyone creates the thing they dread.

565
00:37:16,403 --> 00:37:19,072
和平时代的人造出战争武器
Men of peace create engines of war.

566
00:37:19,531 --> 00:37:21,825
侵略者造出复仇者
Invaders create Avengers.

567
00:37:21,908 --> 00:37:23,493
人类制造出...
People create...

568
00:37:24,786 --> 00:37:26,996
更小的人...
smaller people...

569
00:37:27,038 --> 00:37:29,624
"小孩" 我刚才想不起来这词
"Children." I lost the word, there.

570
00:37:30,291 --> 00:37:31,876
小孩
Children

571
00:37:32,002 --> 00:37:34,087
制造出来替代他们
designed to supplant them,

572
00:37:34,170 --> 00:37:37,132
终结他们
to help them... end.

573
00:37:37,674 --> 00:37:41,011
你也是为这而来的吗 来终结复仇者们?
Is that why you've come, to end the Avengers?

574
00:37:41,136 --> 00:37:43,430
我是来拯救世界的
I've come to save the world.

575
00:37:44,139 --> 00:37:46,850
但你说的... 也对
But also... Yeah.

576
00:37:51,021 --> 00:37:52,689
我们马上就出发
We'll move out right away.

577
00:37:52,731 --> 00:37:55,692
这是个开始 但在真正开始之前还需要一些东西
This is a start, but there's something we need to begin the real work.

578
00:37:56,317 --> 00:37:58,111
- 这些都是...  - 我
- All of these are...  - Me.

579
00:37:58,695 --> 00:38:02,198
我有那些复仇者从来都没有过的东西... 和谐
I have what the Avengers never will... Harmony.

580
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:04,367
他们矛盾重重 关系不够紧密
They're discordant, disconnected,

581
00:38:04,409 --> 00:38:06,536
斯塔克已经让他们起内讧了
Stark's already got them turning on each other,

582
00:38:06,578 --> 00:38:09,039
到时你再趁机扰乱其他人的思绪...
and when you get inside the rest of their heads...

583
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:11,207
所有人都没想要杀他们
Everyone's plan is not to kill them.

584
00:38:11,374 --> 00:38:12,792
因为会让他们成为烈士?
And make them martyrs?

585
00:38:13,376 --> 00:38:15,170
别着急
You need patience.

586
00:38:15,211 --> 00:38:17,005
你得着眼大局
Need to see the big picture.

587
00:38:17,047 --> 00:38:20,383
我看不到什么大局 我只看得到一个小小的画面
I don't see the big picture. I have a little picture.

588
00:38:21,217 --> 00:38:23,053
我每天都把它拿出来
I take it out and look at it,

589
00:38:24,012 --> 00:38:25,305
看看
every day.

590
00:38:25,430 --> 00:38:28,058
你在一场爆炸中失去了父母 我看过你的资料
You lost your parents in the bombings. I've seen the records.

591
00:38:28,183 --> 00:38:29,351
资料又看不到那个画面
The records are not the picture.

592
00:38:29,392 --> 00:38:30,518
皮特
Pietro.

593
00:38:30,643 --> 00:38:31,895
对 请继续说
No, please.

594
00:38:34,898 --> 00:38:38,109
我们十岁那年 我们一家四口正在吃晚饭
We were 10 years old. Having dinner, the four of us.

595
00:38:39,486 --> 00:38:41,488
第一颗炸弹击中了我们家下面两层
When the first shell hits two floors below,

596
00:38:41,571 --> 00:38:43,656
把地板炸开了一个洞
it makes a hole of the floor.

597
00:38:43,740 --> 00:38:45,325
很大的洞
It's big.

598
00:38:46,659 --> 00:38:47,911
我父母掉了进去
Our parents go in,

599
00:38:48,703 --> 00:38:51,790
整幢楼开始... 瓦解
and the whole building starts... coming apart.

600
00:38:52,457 --> 00:38:54,125
我抓住她
I grab her,

601
00:38:54,584 --> 00:38:56,753
滚到床下 接着第二颗炸弹又来了
roll under the bed, and the second shell hits.

602
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:59,130
但它并没有爆炸
But it doesn't go off.

603
00:39:01,091 --> 00:39:02,801
它只是...
It just...

604
00:39:03,176 --> 00:39:05,261
躺在碎石之中
sits there in the rubble.

605
00:39:06,096 --> 00:39:08,473
离我们只有三英尺
Three feet from our faces.

606
00:39:09,557 --> 00:39:13,103
而弹壳上面写着一个词
And on the side of the shell is painted one word.

607
00:39:13,186 --> 00:39:14,938
"斯塔克"
"Stark."

608
00:39:16,564 --> 00:39:18,900
我们在里面困了两天
We were trapped for two days.

609
00:39:19,234 --> 00:39:21,152
救援队每努力一分
Every effort to save us,

610
00:39:21,236 --> 00:39:22,779
每搬起一块砖
every shift in the bricks,

611
00:39:22,862 --> 00:39:25,448
我都在想 "这样会爆炸的吧"
I think, "This will set it off."

612
00:39:28,576 --> 00:39:32,455
我们等托尼·斯塔克杀掉我们等了两天
We wait for two days for Tony Stark to kill us.

613
00:39:34,874 --> 00:39:36,793
我知道他们是什么人
I know what they are.

614
00:39:37,919 --> 00:39:41,715
我之前还在想 为什么你们两个可以在斯特拉克的实验中存活下来
I wondered why only you two survived Strucker's experiments.

615
00:39:42,632 --> 00:39:43,883
现在我知道了
Now I don't.

616
00:39:44,009 --> 00:39:46,094
我们会伸张正义的
We will make it right.

617
00:39:46,219 --> 00:39:47,971
你和我能够伤害到他们
You and I can hurt them.

618
00:39:49,347 --> 00:39:52,726
但是你... 要从内部...
But you...  will tear them apart...

619
00:39:54,644 --> 00:39:56,563
瓦解他们
from the inside.

620
00:40:02,902 --> 00:40:04,320
他分散到了全球各地
He's all over the globe.

621
00:40:04,362 --> 00:40:07,657
机器人实验室 武器装备库 喷气推进实验室
Robotics labs, weapons facilities, jet propulsion labs.

622
00:40:07,699 --> 00:40:11,870
报告说有一个或一群金属人进去把实验室清空了
Reports of a metal man, or men, coming in and emptying the place.

623
00:40:11,953 --> 00:40:13,038
伤亡情况呢?
Fatalities?

624
00:40:13,121 --> 00:40:14,372
只是在交战过程中有伤亡
Only when engaged.

625
00:40:14,456 --> 00:40:16,124
大多数人处于神游状态
Mostly guys left in a fugue state

626
00:40:16,166 --> 00:40:18,501
不断回想从前的记忆 最深的恐惧
going on about old memories, worst fears,

627
00:40:18,585 --> 00:40:20,837
还有一些"来不及看清的东西"
and "something too fast to see."

628
00:40:20,879 --> 00:40:22,380
是马克西莫夫
Maximoffs.

629
00:40:22,505 --> 00:40:25,342
他去找他们也在情理之中 因为他们有共同认识的人
That makes sense he'd go to them. They have someone in common.

630
00:40:25,383 --> 00:40:27,385
不再有了
Not anymore.

631
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:30,555
冯·斯特拉克男爵死亡
为了和平

632
00:40:31,181 --> 00:40:33,183
不行 这就是我的回答
That's a negative. I answer to you.

633
00:40:34,476 --> 00:40:35,560
好的 女士
Yes, ma'am.

634
00:40:35,643 --> 00:40:37,562
巴顿 有新发现
Barton. Might have something.

635
00:40:37,687 --> 00:40:39,064
我得挂了
I gotta go.

636
00:40:39,147 --> 00:40:40,357
打给谁的?
Who was that?

637
00:40:41,024 --> 00:40:42,400
女朋友
Girlfriend.

638
00:40:45,070 --> 00:40:46,321
这是什么?
What's this?

639
00:40:46,363 --> 00:40:48,698
留言 是奥创杀了斯特拉克
A message. Ultron killed Strucker.

640
00:40:49,824 --> 00:40:52,869
他还专门在犯罪现场留了涂鸦给我们看
And he did a Banksy at the crime scene, just for us.

641
00:40:52,952 --> 00:40:54,412
这是个障眼法
This is a smoke screen.

642
00:40:54,537 --> 00:40:56,873
刚在我们面前说教过 干嘛还留言?
Why send a message when you've just given a speech?

643
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:59,334
斯特拉克知道了些奥创不想让我们知道的事情
Strucker knew something that Ultron wanted us to miss.

644
00:40:59,376 --> 00:41:00,460
我打赌他... 是的
Yeah, I bet he... Yeah.

645
00:41:01,670 --> 00:41:03,546
我们手上所有关于斯特拉克的信息都被删得干干净净
Everything we had on Strucker's been erased.

646
00:41:04,047 --> 00:41:05,382
也不是所有信息
Not everything.

647
00:41:06,925 --> 00:41:08,968
都是和他有关的人
Known associates.

648
00:41:09,135 --> 00:41:10,720
斯特拉克男爵有很多朋友
Baron Strucker had a lot of friends.

649
00:41:10,804 --> 00:41:12,389
这些人全都恶贯满盈
Well, these people are all horrible.

650
00:41:12,472 --> 00:41:14,307
等等 我认识这个人
Wait. I know that guy.

651
00:41:16,559 --> 00:41:18,311
之前他在非洲海岸做生意
From back in the day, he operates off the African coast,

652
00:41:18,436 --> 00:41:19,479
买卖黑市军火
black market arms.

653
00:41:20,647 --> 00:41:22,565
只是在军火大会上 我会碰到很多人
There are conventions. All right? I meet people.

654
00:41:22,649 --> 00:41:24,818
我没有卖给过他任何东西
I didn't sell him anything.

655
00:41:24,901 --> 00:41:26,986
他当时说要找一种可以扭转乾坤的新武器
He was talking about finding something new, a game-changer.

656
00:41:27,112 --> 00:41:28,571
{\an8}亚哈船长: 小说"白鲸记"主人公

657
00:41:27,112 --> 00:41:28,571
和亚哈船长感觉很像
It was all very Ahab.

658
00:41:28,655 --> 00:41:29,698
这是什么?
This?

659
00:41:29,739 --> 00:41:31,408
一个纹身 我不记得他有这个
It's a tattoo, I don't think he had it.

660
00:41:31,574 --> 00:41:34,285
不 那些是纹身 但这是一个标记
No, those are tattoos, this is a brand.

661
00:41:35,578 --> 00:41:39,124
对 这是非洲土著语的"小偷"的意思
Yeah. It's a word in an African dialect meaning "thief",

662
00:41:39,624 --> 00:41:41,001
语义更恶意一些
in a much less friendly way.

663
00:41:41,167 --> 00:41:43,128
- 哪里的土著语?  - 瓦肯纳达
- What dialect?  - Wakanada.

664
00:41:43,211 --> 00:41:44,879
瓦坎达
Wakanda.

665
00:41:46,339 --> 00:41:48,925
如果他从瓦坎达得到了那些货...
If this guy got out of Wakanda with some of their trade goods...

666
00:41:48,967 --> 00:41:50,301
我以为你父亲说他拿到的是最后一批货
I thought your father said he got the last of it.

667
00:41:50,427 --> 00:41:53,430
我不明白 瓦坎达那有什么货?
I don't follow. What comes out of Wakanda?

668
00:41:54,973 --> 00:41:56,975
世界上最坚硬的金属
The strongest metal on Earth.

669
00:41:58,226 --> 00:41:59,728
这人现在在哪?
Where is this guy now?

670
00:42:09,855 --> 00:42:11,775
丘吉尔号 英国

671
00:42:25,128 --> 00:42:26,963
别跟我扯什么你的人坑了你
Don't tell me your men swindled you.

672
00:42:27,047 --> 00:42:32,135
我给你发了六颗短程热导导弹 得到的却是一堆废铁
I sent you six short-range heat-seekers and got a boat full of rusted parts.

673
00:42:32,302 --> 00:42:33,636
现在你必须想办法解决
Now, you will make it right,

674
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:37,140
否则我很快就会再送你一颗导弹
or the next missile I send you will come very much faster.

675
00:42:38,808 --> 00:42:41,436
好了 部长先生 刚才说到哪了?
Now, minister, where were we?

676
00:43:12,884 --> 00:43:15,845
好啊 原来是强化人
Yeah. The Enhanced.

677
00:43:16,513 --> 00:43:18,306
斯特拉克的得意门生
Strucker's prize pupils.

678
00:43:21,017 --> 00:43:22,769
吃点糖果吗?
Do you want a candy?

679
00:43:24,437 --> 00:43:27,107
对于斯特拉克的死我很遗憾
Oh, I was sorry to hear about Strucker.

680
00:43:27,190 --> 00:43:30,318
但是他知道他试图创建的世界会是什么样的
But then, he knew what kind of world he was helping create.

681
00:43:30,819 --> 00:43:33,196
人命... 可不是有潜力的市场
Human life... not a growth market.

682
00:43:35,657 --> 00:43:37,659
你们不知道?
You, You didn't know?

683
00:43:37,784 --> 00:43:41,663
这是你们第一次威胁别人吗?
Is this your first time intimidating someone?

684
00:43:41,705 --> 00:43:44,249
我恐怕... 没那么害怕
I'm afraid... I'm not that afraid.

685
00:43:44,374 --> 00:43:46,710
每个人都有害怕的东西
Everybody is afraid of something.

686
00:43:46,876 --> 00:43:47,877
乌贼
Cuttlefish.

687
00:43:49,212 --> 00:43:50,213
深海里的鱼
Deep sea fish.

688
00:43:50,630 --> 00:43:52,382
它们会发光 就像迪斯科灯光那样...
They make lights, disco lights...

689
00:43:53,883 --> 00:43:55,927
来迷惑自己的猎物 然后...
to hypnotize their prey, and then...

690
00:43:57,053 --> 00:43:59,222
我看过一个纪录片 很恐怖的
I saw a documentary. It was terrifying.

691
00:44:04,728 --> 00:44:07,313
如果你想扰乱我的心智
So if you're going to fiddle with my brain

692
00:44:08,231 --> 00:44:10,650
让我看到一个巨大的乌贼
and make me see a giant cuttlefish,

693
00:44:10,734 --> 00:44:12,861
那我就知道你们不是来做生意的
then I know you don't do business.

694
00:44:12,902 --> 00:44:15,280
你们也不是管事的
And I know you're not in charge.

695
00:44:15,405 --> 00:44:16,781
我只跟...
And I only deal...

696
00:44:17,782 --> 00:44:19,743
管事的人做交易
with the man in charge.

697
00:44:24,497 --> 00:44:26,916
这里没有"人"管事
There is no man in charge.

698
00:44:29,836 --> 00:44:31,588
咱们来谈谈生意吧
Let's talk business.

699
00:44:34,476 --> 00:44:38,854
有毒废料

700
00:44:44,476 --> 00:44:47,854
在这块石头上 我要建立自己的教会
Upon this rock, I will build my church.

701
00:44:49,439 --> 00:44:50,482
振金
Vibranium.

702
00:44:51,858 --> 00:44:52,942
你要知道
You know,

703
00:44:53,109 --> 00:44:56,488
我可是花了血本的
it came at great personal cost.

704
00:44:56,613 --> 00:44:58,448
它值好几十亿呢
It's worth billions.

705
00:45:02,702 --> 00:45:04,120
现在你也值这么多钱了
Now so are you.

706
00:45:04,954 --> 00:45:06,748
划到你的"皮包公司"名下了
It's all under your "dummy holdings".

707
00:45:06,873 --> 00:45:08,958
金融真是奇怪
Finance is so weird.

708
00:45:10,293 --> 00:45:11,503
但我总说
But I always say,

709
00:45:11,586 --> 00:45:12,712
"让自己的朋友和敌人都富起来
"Keep your friends rich and your enemies rich

710
00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:15,757
然后等着看到底谁是朋友 谁是敌人"
and wait to find out which is which."

711
00:45:18,510 --> 00:45:19,636
斯塔克
Stark.

712
00:45:20,970 --> 00:45:22,263
什么?
What?

713
00:45:22,305 --> 00:45:24,307
托尼·斯塔克以前也跟我...
Tony Stark used to say that...

714
00:45:25,475 --> 00:45:26,601
说过这句话
To me.

715
00:45:27,560 --> 00:45:28,853
你是他制造出来的
You're one of his.

716
00:45:28,978 --> 00:45:30,689
什么? 我不是...
What? I'm not...

717
00:45:32,649 --> 00:45:34,150
我不是
I'm not.

718
00:45:34,234 --> 00:45:35,735
你认为我只是个斯塔克的傀儡
You think I'm one of Stark's puppets?

719
00:45:35,860 --> 00:45:36,945
一个空心人吗?
His hollow men?

720
00:45:37,404 --> 00:45:39,739
看着我 我看起来像钢铁侠吗?
I mean, look at me. Do I look like Iron Man?

721
00:45:39,823 --> 00:45:41,074
斯塔克什么都不是!
Stark is nothing!

722
00:45:42,826 --> 00:45:45,120
对不起 我... 噢
I'm sorry. I'm... Oh

723
00:45:45,161 --> 00:45:47,247
我肯定你会没事的 对不起
I'm sure that's gonna be okay. I'm sorry.

724
00:45:47,330 --> 00:45:49,040
只是我不明白
It's just that I don't understand.

725
00:45:49,124 --> 00:45:52,210
别拿我和斯塔克比!
Don't compare me with Stark!

726
00:45:53,753 --> 00:45:55,338
我对这事非常介意
It's a thing with me.

727
00:45:55,463 --> 00:45:57,340
斯塔克... 他就是个变态!
Stark is... He's a sickness!

728
00:45:57,465 --> 00:45:59,175
噢 臭小子
Oh... Junior.

729
00:46:00,802 --> 00:46:02,512
你真是伤透你老爸的心了
You're gonna break your old man's heart.

730
00:46:03,847 --> 00:46:04,973
正合我意
If I have to.

731
00:46:07,183 --> 00:46:08,643
谁都不用弄坏东西
Nobody has to break anything.

732
00:46:08,685 --> 00:46:10,395
显然你没做过煎蛋卷
Clearly you've never made an omelet.

733
00:46:10,520 --> 00:46:11,855
他把我的台词抢走了
He beat me by one second.

734
00:46:12,939 --> 00:46:14,274
啊... 真有趣 斯塔克先生
Ah... It is funny, Mr. Stark

735
00:46:16,901 --> 00:46:18,611
在里面... 舒服吗?
It's what... Comfortable?

736
00:46:20,196 --> 00:46:21,573
跟以前一样?
Like old times?

737
00:46:21,698 --> 00:46:22,741
这从来都不是我的生活
This was never my life.

738
00:46:22,824 --> 00:46:24,242
你们两个现在走还来得及
You two can still walk away from this.

739
00:46:24,367 --> 00:46:25,702
好啊
Oh, We will.

740
00:46:25,744 --> 00:46:26,995
我知道你们受了很多苦
I know you've suffered.

741
00:46:27,954 --> 00:46:29,414
美国队长
Ah... Captain America.

742
00:46:29,956 --> 00:46:32,542
正义的化身
God's righteous man.

743
00:46:32,584 --> 00:46:34,961
假装没有战争你也可以生存下去
Pretending you could live without a war.

744
00:46:35,712 --> 00:46:38,631
在生理上我没法吐出来 但...
I can't physically throw up in my mouth, but...

745
00:46:38,715 --> 00:46:41,009
如果你相信和平 那就让我们一起来维护它吧
If you believe in peace, then let us keep it.

746
00:46:41,301 --> 00:46:44,721
我想你是把"和平"和"平静"弄混了吧
I think you're confusing "peace" with "quiet."

747
00:46:45,180 --> 00:46:46,681
是吗? 那振金是用来干什么的?
Yeah? What's the vibranium for?

748
00:46:46,806 --> 00:46:47,891
你终于问到这个了
I'm glad you asked that,

749
00:46:47,974 --> 00:46:51,728
因为我正想借此告诉你们我的邪恶计划
because I wanted to take this time to explain my evil plan.

750
00:47:11,289 --> 00:47:13,166
- 开枪  - 打哪边?
- Shoot them.  - Which ones?

751
00:47:13,249 --> 00:47:14,459
两边都打!
All of them!

752
00:47:14,542 --> 00:47:15,877
上! 上! 上!
Move! Move! Move!

753
00:48:04,676 --> 00:48:05,927
待在这吧 小子
Stay down, kid.

754
00:48:08,304 --> 00:48:10,849
该玩点脑力游戏了
It's time for some mind games.

755
00:48:12,142 --> 00:48:14,477
各位? 需要我变身吗?
Guys? Is this a code green?

756
00:48:30,326 --> 00:48:31,327
索尔 情况如何
Thor, status.

757
00:48:31,995 --> 00:48:33,955
这个女孩想扭曲我的思想
The girl tried to warp my mind.

758
00:48:33,997 --> 00:48:37,125
要特别小心 人类估计很容易受她影响
Take special care. I doubt a human could keep her at bay.

759
00:48:37,500 --> 00:48:40,545
还好 我是神
Fortunately, I am mighty.

760
00:49:00,190 --> 00:49:02,525
进展非常顺利
This is going very well.

761
00:49:13,995 --> 00:49:15,372
我的心智早就被操控过了
I've done the whole mind control thing.

762
00:49:16,373 --> 00:49:17,540
但一点都不喜欢
Not a fan.

763
00:49:24,714 --> 00:49:27,175
没错 你最好赶快跑
Yeah, you better run.

764
00:49:28,718 --> 00:49:30,595
还有没倒下的吗? 我们要撤了!
Who's ever standing, we got to move!

765
00:49:32,555 --> 00:49:33,598
各位?
Guys?

766
00:49:51,408 --> 00:49:52,409
再来
Again.

767
00:49:52,992 --> 00:49:54,244
你会毁了她们的
You'll break them.

768
00:49:54,744 --> 00:49:56,413
只有脆弱的人才会被摧毁
Only the breakable ones.

769
00:49:56,955 --> 00:49:58,540
你是坚不可摧的
You're made of marble.

770
00:49:58,832 --> 00:50:01,084
我们在毕业典礼后就庆祝
We'll celebrate after the graduation ceremony.

771
00:50:01,918 --> 00:50:03,128
要是我失败了呢?
What if I fail?

772
00:50:08,633 --> 00:50:09,926
你从来都不会失败
You never fail.

773
00:50:32,782 --> 00:50:34,701
准备好一起跳舞了吗?
Are you ready for our dance?

774
00:50:43,918 --> 00:50:44,961
就是他吗?
Is it him?

775
00:50:45,128 --> 00:50:47,255
奥丁的长子?
Is that the first son of Odin?

776
00:50:47,756 --> 00:50:49,382
海姆达尔 你的眼睛...
Heimdall, your eyes...

777
00:50:49,883 --> 00:50:51,968
它们什么都能看得见
They see everything.

778
00:50:52,135 --> 00:50:54,304
它们看到你将我们带入地狱
They see you leading us to Hel.

779
00:50:55,472 --> 00:50:56,681
醒醒!
Wake up!

780
00:50:59,809 --> 00:51:01,728
战争已经结束了 史蒂夫
The war is over, Steve.

781
00:51:02,145 --> 00:51:03,646
我们可以回家了
We can go home.

782
00:51:05,231 --> 00:51:06,441
想象一下
Imagine it.

783
00:51:15,658 --> 00:51:17,410
我仍然可以救你们!
I can still save you!

784
00:51:17,535 --> 00:51:20,997
我们都死了! 你难道看不到吗?
We're all dead! Can you not see it?

785
00:51:25,543 --> 00:51:28,088
你是个毁灭者 奥丁之子
You're a destroyer, Odin-son.

786
00:51:31,091 --> 00:51:33,259
看看你的力量引向何处
See where your power leads.

787
00:51:44,020 --> 00:51:45,188
不用心
Sloppy.

788
00:51:45,980 --> 00:51:47,524
假装失败
Pretending to fail.

789
00:51:48,858 --> 00:51:50,318
典礼是一定要的
The ceremony is necessary,

790
00:51:51,486 --> 00:51:53,655
这样你才能在这个世界有一席之地
for you to take your place in the world.

791
00:51:54,531 --> 00:51:55,782
这世界容不下我
I have no place in the world.

792
00:51:55,865 --> 00:51:57,033
没错
Exactly.

793
00:52:02,163 --> 00:52:04,124
- 我该怎么做?  - 头好痛
- What can I do?  - It hurts.

794
00:52:05,375 --> 00:52:06,376
我要去杀了他
I'm going to kill him.

795
00:52:06,418 --> 00:52:07,711
- 我马上就回来  - 别走
- I'll be right back.  - No.

796
00:52:07,836 --> 00:52:09,170
我没事
I'm all right.

797
00:52:10,046 --> 00:52:11,131
我想...
I want...

798
00:52:14,092 --> 00:52:16,261
我想完成这个计划
I want to finish the plan.

799
00:52:16,803 --> 00:52:18,805
我要那个大家伙
I want the big one.

800
00:52:29,524 --> 00:52:31,276
振金马上就要被移走了
The vibranium is getting away.

801
00:52:32,068 --> 00:52:33,403
但你哪都别想去
And you're not going anywhere.

802
00:52:33,570 --> 00:52:36,364
我当然不走 我已经达到我的目的了
Of course not. I'm already there.

803
00:52:36,489 --> 00:52:37,574
将来你会明白的
You'll catch on.

804
00:52:37,699 --> 00:52:40,160
但你得先找到班纳博士
But first, you might need to catch Dr. Banner.

805
00:52:54,758 --> 00:52:56,718
搜索新闻或监控录像 关键字"浩克"
News or footage. Keyword, "Hulk."

806
00:53:01,473 --> 00:53:03,433
娜塔莎 我现在真的很需要安眠曲
Natasha, I could really use a lullaby.

807
00:53:03,475 --> 00:53:06,561
她暂时不能给你安眠曲了
That's not gonna happen. Not for a while.

808
00:53:07,020 --> 00:53:08,813
整队人都完蛋了
The whole team is down.

809
00:53:09,272 --> 00:53:10,398
这里没人能支援你
You got no backup here.

810
00:53:11,608 --> 00:53:13,026
我叫维罗妮卡来
I'm calling in Veronica.

811
00:53:24,454 --> 00:53:25,955
我们需要支援!
We need backup!

812
00:54:04,911 --> 00:54:06,287
快! 抓进跟上!
Go! Keep moving!

813
00:54:45,618 --> 00:54:47,787
好了 各位 不要妄动!
All right, everybody, stand down!

814
00:54:54,044 --> 00:54:55,462
听我说句话好吗?
Will you listen to me?

815
00:54:55,587 --> 00:54:58,256
那个小女巫正在让你神智错乱
That little witch is messing with your mind.

816
00:54:58,340 --> 00:55:00,592
你比她要强大 而且比她聪明
You're stronger than her. You're smarter than her.

817
00:55:00,675 --> 00:55:02,218
因为你是布鲁斯·班纳
You're Bruce Banner.

818
00:55:02,927 --> 00:55:04,137
好 好 好 我不提那个弱班纳了
Right, right, right, don't mention puny Banner.

819
00:55:09,684 --> 00:55:10,685
好吧!
Okay!

820
00:55:32,499 --> 00:55:33,833
从后面来?
In the back?

821
00:55:33,917 --> 00:55:34,959
这招真蠢 班纳
Dick move, Banner.

822
00:55:46,763 --> 00:55:47,931
维罗妮卡 给我个手
Veronica, give me a hand.

823
00:56:15,750 --> 00:56:16,793
睡吧 睡吧 睡吧
Go to sleep, go to sleep, go to sleep.

824
00:56:26,678 --> 00:56:28,346
好吧 伙计 我得把你带出这座城镇
Okay, pal, we're gonna get you out of town.

825
00:56:30,348 --> 00:56:31,641
别去那边 别去那边
Not that way, not that way.

826
00:56:40,108 --> 00:56:42,110
拜托 布鲁斯! 你得配合点
Come on, Bruce! You gotta work with me.

827
00:56:55,623 --> 00:56:56,708
所有人快出去!
Everybody, out!

828
00:57:03,631 --> 00:57:04,799
下楼吗?
Going down?

829
00:57:14,392 --> 00:57:15,518
对不起
I'm sorry.

830
00:57:29,657 --> 00:57:30,825
损伤报告?
Damage report?

831
00:57:31,659 --> 00:57:34,037
这太笼统了 给我来点有用的
That's comprehensive. Show me something.

832
00:57:42,600 --> 00:57:43,700
检测生物信号

833
00:57:43,800 --> 00:57:44,300
检测到平民数量 0

834
00:57:44,300 --> 00:57:45,400
安全

835
00:57:45,548 --> 00:57:47,217
我们多快可以把这幢楼买下来?
How quickly can we buy this building?

836
00:58:19,457 --> 00:58:20,834
- 快! 快! 快!  - 上! 上! 上!
- Move! Move! Move!  - Go, go, go!

837
00:58:24,671 --> 00:58:25,672
包抄他 包抄他!
Flank him, flank him!

838
00:59:15,430 --> 00:59:17,515
新闻媒体爱死你们了
The news is loving you guys.

839
00:59:18,600 --> 00:59:20,143
但其他人快恨死了
Nobody else is.

840
00:59:20,643 --> 00:59:22,771
虽然还没有逮捕班纳的正式命令
There's been no official call for Banner's arrest

841
00:59:22,812 --> 00:59:24,981
但是消息已经传开了
but it's in the air.

842
00:59:25,482 --> 00:59:26,566
斯塔克救援基金会呢?
The Stark Relief Foundation?

843
00:59:26,649 --> 00:59:27,984
已经到现场了
Already on the scene.

844
00:59:28,068 --> 00:59:29,277
大家都怎么样?
How's the team?

845
00:59:29,319 --> 00:59:31,154
每个人都...
Everyone's...

846
00:59:31,279 --> 00:59:34,074
我们遭到了重创 但我们会没事的
We took a hit. We'll shake it off.

847
00:59:34,199 --> 00:59:38,119
嗯 就现在来说 我会选择藏匿起来 远离这里
Well, for now, I'd stay in stealth mode and stay away from here.

848
00:59:39,496 --> 00:59:41,081
逃跑并躲起来?
So, run and hide?

849
00:59:41,623 --> 00:59:43,124
在我们可以找到奥创前
Until we can find Ultron,

850
00:59:43,249 --> 00:59:46,127
我没有更好的主意
I don't have a lot else to offer.

851
00:59:46,586 --> 00:59:48,129
我们也是
Neither do we.

852
00:59:54,844 --> 00:59:56,596
嗨 你想我替你吗?
Hey, you wanna switch out?

853
00:59:56,680 --> 00:59:57,972
不用 我没事
No, I'm good.

854
00:59:58,348 --> 01:00:00,350
如果你想打个盹 现在正是时候
If you wanna get some kip, now's a good time

855
01:00:00,433 --> 01:00:02,018
因为我们还有几小时才到
because we're still a few hours out.

856
01:00:02,060 --> 01:00:03,728
几小时到哪?
Few hours from where?

857
01:00:04,521 --> 01:00:05,897
一个安全屋
A safe house.

858
01:00:32,298 --> 01:00:33,842
这是什么地方?
What is this place?

859
01:00:33,883 --> 01:00:35,343
安全屋
Safe house.

860
01:00:36,261 --> 01:00:37,554
但愿是吧
Let's hope.

861
01:00:42,434 --> 01:00:43,518
亲爱的
Honey?

862
01:00:44,060 --> 01:00:45,270
我回来了
I'm home.

863
01:00:47,897 --> 01:00:48,898
嗨
Hi.

864
01:00:49,065 --> 01:00:50,150
我的同伴
Company.

865
01:00:50,275 --> 01:00:51,317
抱歉 没提前打电话给你
Sorry, didn't call ahead.

866
01:00:51,401 --> 01:00:52,569
嘿
Hey.

867
01:00:53,236 --> 01:00:54,279
这肯定是某个特工
This is an agent of some kind.

868
01:00:54,904 --> 01:00:57,407
先生们 这是劳拉
Gentlemen, this is Laura.

869
01:00:58,366 --> 01:01:00,243
我知道你们所有人的名字
I know all of your names.

870
01:01:03,288 --> 01:01:04,706
来人了
Incoming.

871
01:01:04,748 --> 01:01:06,541
- 爸爸!  - 嗨 宝贝儿!
- Dad!  - Hi, sweetheart!

872
01:01:06,583 --> 01:01:07,792
嘿 伙计
Hey, buddy.

873
01:01:07,917 --> 01:01:09,419
你们好吗?
How are you guys doing?

874
01:01:09,544 --> 01:01:11,588
- 这俩是小特工  - 看看你的脸!
- These are smaller agents.  - Look at your face!

875
01:01:11,755 --> 01:01:12,839
天啊
Oh, my goodness.

876
01:01:12,964 --> 01:01:14,466
你把娜塔莎阿姨带来了吗?
Did you bring Auntie Nat?

877
01:01:15,633 --> 01:01:18,094
为什么你不自己抱抱她看呢?
Why don't you hug her and find out?

878
01:01:19,637 --> 01:01:20,889
很抱歉 我们贸然拜访你家
Sorry for barging in on you.

879
01:01:20,930 --> 01:01:21,973
是啊 我们本来可以提前打个电话的
Yeah, we would have called ahead,

880
01:01:22,057 --> 01:01:24,184
但是我们根本就不知道你的存在
but we were busy having no idea that you existed.

881
01:01:24,309 --> 01:01:27,270
好吧 我加入的时候弗瑞帮我安排的
Yeah, well, Fury helped me set this up when I joined.

882
01:01:27,937 --> 01:01:30,857
他没有把这事写到神盾局的档案里 我也想这样
He kept it off S.H.I.E.L.D.'s files. I'd like to keep it that way.

883
01:01:31,608 --> 01:01:33,360
我觉得这是能休息放松的好地方
I figure it's a good place to lay low.

884
01:01:33,485 --> 01:01:34,486
亲爱的
Honey.

885
01:01:35,862 --> 01:01:36,905
我想你
I missed you.

886
01:01:36,988 --> 01:01:38,448
小娜塔莎好吗?
How's little Natasha?

887
01:01:38,615 --> 01:01:39,991
她...
She's...

888
01:01:42,118 --> 01:01:43,203
是男孩子
Nathaniel.

889
01:01:45,872 --> 01:01:46,915
小叛徒
Traitor.

890
01:02:02,806 --> 01:02:03,848
索尔?
Thor?

891
01:02:03,973 --> 01:02:05,975
我在那梦里看到一些东西
I saw something in that dream.

892
01:02:06,017 --> 01:02:08,687
我需要答案 但在这里找不到
I need answers. I won't find them here.

893
01:02:19,155 --> 01:02:20,532
我们可以回家
We can go home.

894
01:02:31,918 --> 01:02:33,878
看吧? 你根本就是在白担心
See? You worried for nothing.

895
01:02:33,962 --> 01:02:36,131
你根本就看不出有什么不同 对吧?
Can't even feel the difference, can you?

896
01:02:38,466 --> 01:02:39,718
如果他们睡在这里
If they're sleeping here,

897
01:02:39,801 --> 01:02:42,012
其中有些人必须得叠起来了
some of them are gonna have to double up.

898
01:02:43,680 --> 01:02:45,890
对啊 他们可不会接受这说法
Yeah, that's not gonna sell.

899
01:02:48,685 --> 01:02:51,354
娜塔莎和班纳士是怎么回事?
What about Nat and Dr. Banner?

900
01:02:51,396 --> 01:02:53,398
他们什么时候开始的?
How long has that been going on?

901
01:02:53,732 --> 01:02:54,733
开始什么?
Has what?

902
01:02:56,026 --> 01:02:57,861
你真可爱
You are so cute.

903
01:02:58,028 --> 01:02:59,571
娜塔莎和班纳?
Nat and Banner?

904
01:03:00,196 --> 01:03:01,573
等你老点我再跟你解释
I'll explain when you're older,

905
01:03:01,698 --> 01:03:02,824
鹰眼
Hawkeye.

906
01:03:02,866 --> 01:03:04,534
嗯 好吧
Well, okay.

907
01:03:06,411 --> 01:03:07,996
情况很糟 是吧?
It's bad, right?

908
01:03:08,121 --> 01:03:09,789
娜塔莎看起来很动摇
Nat seems really shaken.

909
01:03:10,707 --> 01:03:12,208
奥创有些盟友
Ultron has these allies.

910
01:03:12,375 --> 01:03:16,421
这些孩子 他们真的很无知
These kids. They're punks, really.

911
01:03:17,881 --> 01:03:20,383
但是他们有很强的能力
But they carry a big, damn stick.

912
01:03:20,467 --> 01:03:21,968
娜塔莎被伤得很重
And Nat took a serious hit.

913
01:03:23,053 --> 01:03:25,513
有人得教教他们规矩
Someone's gonna have to teach them some manners.

914
01:03:25,638 --> 01:03:27,390
那个人就是你
That someone being you.

915
01:03:28,850 --> 01:03:31,728
你知道我完全支持你的工作
You know I totally support your avenging.

916
01:03:31,770 --> 01:03:33,688
我对此无比骄傲
I couldn't be prouder.

917
01:03:35,190 --> 01:03:36,483
但是我看那些人...
But I see those guys...

918
01:03:36,608 --> 01:03:38,693
那些神...
Those gods...

919
01:03:40,612 --> 01:03:42,906
你觉得他们不需要我
You don't think they need me.

920
01:03:43,073 --> 01:03:46,743
我想他们需要你 这才更可怕
I think they do, which is a lot scarier.

921
01:03:47,869 --> 01:03:49,079
他们真是一团糟
They're a mess.

922
01:03:50,663 --> 01:03:51,664
是啊
Yeah.

923
01:03:52,415 --> 01:03:54,167
我猜他们就是来给我捣乱的
I guess they're my mess.

924
01:03:55,418 --> 01:03:57,420
你得确保
You need to be sure

925
01:03:57,462 --> 01:04:00,090
这是一个真正的团队
that this team is really a team,

926
01:04:00,173 --> 01:04:02,092
确保他们是你的强援
and that they have your back.

927
01:04:05,303 --> 01:04:07,931
我们的情况变了
Things are changing for us.

928
01:04:07,972 --> 01:04:10,475
再过几个月
In a few months' time,

929
01:04:10,558 --> 01:04:13,353
我们又得迎来一个小家伙
you and me are gonna be outnumbered.

930
01:04:13,436 --> 01:04:14,771
我需要...
I need...

931
01:04:17,941 --> 01:04:19,776
你得保证
Just be sure.

932
01:04:20,568 --> 01:04:22,070
遵命 女士
Yes, ma'am.

933
01:04:31,121 --> 01:04:33,039
我能感觉出不同了 
I can feel the difference.

934
01:04:46,094 --> 01:04:48,763
你敢叫喊 所有人都得死
Scream, and your entire staff dies.

935
01:04:50,640 --> 01:04:52,976
我们相遇的那晚 我本来可以杀了你 海伦
I could've killed you, Helen, the night we met.

936
01:04:53,059 --> 01:04:54,185
但我没有
I didn't.

937
01:04:54,269 --> 01:04:55,854
你想让我跟你说谢谢吗?
Do you expect a thank-you note?

938
01:04:55,979 --> 01:04:57,731
我想你该知道原因
I expect you to know why.

939
01:04:58,857 --> 01:04:59,858
再生摇篮
The Cradle.

940
01:05:00,358 --> 01:05:02,402
这是下一个 托尼
This is the next thing, Tony.

941
01:05:02,485 --> 01:05:05,613
这是下一个我
This is the next me.

942
01:05:05,739 --> 01:05:08,450
再生摇篮能打印组织
The Regeneration Cradle prints tissue.

943
01:05:08,491 --> 01:05:10,160
但它不能制造活体
It can't build a living body.

944
01:05:10,285 --> 01:05:11,327
它可以的 因为你可以
It can. You can.

945
01:05:11,828 --> 01:05:13,204
你只是缺少材料
You lack the materials.

946
01:05:15,498 --> 01:05:16,958
你是个很出色的女人 海伦
You're a brilliant woman, Helen.

947
01:05:20,003 --> 01:05:23,673
但是我们都有提升的空间
But we all have room to improve.

948
01:05:44,903 --> 01:05:47,530
我不知道你等在外面
I didn't realize you were waiting.

949
01:05:47,572 --> 01:05:48,573
我本来想进去跟你一起洗
I would've joined you,

950
01:05:48,656 --> 01:05:52,035
但现在似乎不是什么好时机
but it didn't seem like the right time.

951
01:05:52,911 --> 01:05:55,205
他们把热水都用光了
They used up all the hot water.

952
01:05:55,872 --> 01:05:57,290
我真该跟你一起洗
I should've joined you.

953
01:05:57,415 --> 01:05:59,209
我们错过机会了
Missed our window.

954
01:05:59,876 --> 01:06:01,211
是吗?
Did we?

955
01:06:04,714 --> 01:06:06,633
全世界都看到了浩克
The world just saw the Hulk.

956
01:06:08,426 --> 01:06:10,387
第一次 看到了真正的浩克
The real Hulk, for the first time.

957
01:06:13,556 --> 01:06:14,557
你知道我必须走的
You know I have to leave.

958
01:06:14,724 --> 01:06:16,267
你就假设我一定得留下来吗?
You assume that I have to stay?

959
01:06:18,228 --> 01:06:20,939
我做了个梦
I had this dream.

960
01:06:21,398 --> 01:06:23,400
那种当时感觉很正常的梦
The kind that seems normal at the time,

961
01:06:24,234 --> 01:06:25,902
但当你醒来时...
but when you wake...

962
01:06:25,985 --> 01:06:27,404
你梦见了什么?
What did you dream?

963
01:06:28,405 --> 01:06:30,240
我梦见我是复仇者
That I was an Avenger.

964
01:06:32,075 --> 01:06:36,079
我梦见我不是被他们造出来的刺客
That I was anything more than the assassin they made me.

965
01:06:37,497 --> 01:06:39,666
我觉得你对自己太苛责了
I think you're being hard on yourself.

966
01:06:41,668 --> 01:06:44,254
我倒希望你能对我霸道点
Here I was hoping that was your job.

967
01:06:47,132 --> 01:06:48,758
你在做什么?
What are you doing?

968
01:06:50,385 --> 01:06:52,220
我在顺其自然
I'm running with it.

969
01:06:53,430 --> 01:06:55,140
跟你一起
With you.

970
01:06:55,807 --> 01:06:58,226
如果你打算逃开
If running is the plan,

971
01:06:59,269 --> 01:07:01,104
天涯海角都无所谓
as far as you want.

972
01:07:02,939 --> 01:07:04,774
你疯了吗?
Are you out of your mind?

973
01:07:09,988 --> 01:07:11,489
我想你明白...
I want you to understand that...

974
01:07:11,573 --> 01:07:13,116
娜塔莎
Natasha,

975
01:07:14,075 --> 01:07:15,577
我还能去哪?
where can I go?

976
01:07:16,619 --> 01:07:18,872
我去哪里才不会被当做威胁?
Where in the world am I not a threat?

977
01:07:18,997 --> 01:07:21,374
- 你对我来说不是个威胁  - 真的吗?
- You're not a threat to me.  - Are you sure?

978
01:07:22,250 --> 01:07:24,002
即使我当时没...
Even if I didn't just...

979
01:07:25,670 --> 01:07:27,213
我没有未来
There's no future with me.

980
01:07:28,757 --> 01:07:29,758
我永远不能...
I can't ever...

981
01:07:29,924 --> 01:07:32,302
我不配拥有这些
I can't have this.

982
01:07:32,969 --> 01:07:34,304
孩子
Kids.

983
01:07:34,429 --> 01:07:37,182
想想吧 我生理上不能拥有孩子
Do the math. I physically can't.

984
01:07:38,808 --> 01:07:40,352
我也不能
Neither can I.

985
01:07:44,981 --> 01:07:48,568
在我长大 并接受培训的...
In the Red Room where I was trained...

986
01:07:48,985 --> 01:07:51,529
那个红色房间
Where I was raised,

987
01:07:52,447 --> 01:07:55,116
有一种毕业典礼
they have a graduation ceremony.

988
01:07:56,701 --> 01:07:58,578
他们会让你绝育
They sterilize you.

989
01:08:01,706 --> 01:08:03,208
这很高效
It's efficient.

990
01:08:06,044 --> 01:08:07,587
少了一件令人担心的事
One less thing to worry about.

991
01:08:09,506 --> 01:08:12,967
这是唯一一件可能比任务还重要的事
The one thing that might matter more than a mission.

992
01:08:15,303 --> 01:08:17,222
它让一切都变得更简单了
Makes everything easier.

993
01:08:18,515 --> 01:08:19,933
甚至是杀戮
Even killing.

994
01:08:24,854 --> 01:08:28,024
你仍然觉得你是这团队里的唯一一只怪物吗?
You still think you're the only monster on the team?

995
01:08:34,155 --> 01:08:36,282
那我们一起消失?
So, we disappear?

996
01:08:42,706 --> 01:08:44,624
索尔没说他去哪找答案了吗?
Thor didn't say where he was going for answers?

997
01:08:45,583 --> 01:08:48,169
有时我的队友并不会跟我坦白
Sometimes my teammates don't tell me things.

998
01:08:49,087 --> 01:08:51,548
我有点希望索尔是个例外
I was kind of hoping Thor would be the exception.

999
01:08:51,715 --> 01:08:53,425
是啊 给他点时间吧
Yeah, give him time.

1000
01:08:53,508 --> 01:08:55,677
我不知道那个叫马克西莫夫的孩子给他看了什么
We don't know what the Maximoff kid showed him.

1001
01:08:57,595 --> 01:08:59,264
"地球上最强大的英雄"
"Earth's mightiest heroes."

1002
01:08:59,347 --> 01:09:01,057
他们可以把我们像棉花糖一样拆开
Pulled us apart like cotton candy.

1003
01:09:01,224 --> 01:09:02,726
看起来你还一切正常啊
Seems like you walked away all right.

1004
01:09:05,311 --> 01:09:06,312
有问题吗?
Is that a problem?

1005
01:09:06,438 --> 01:09:08,690
我不相信一个人会没有阴暗面
I don't trust a guy without a dark side.

1006
01:09:09,774 --> 01:09:10,817
尽管说我是老古董吧
Call me old-fashioned.

1007
01:09:10,942 --> 01:09:13,737
嗯 其实是你还没有看到我的阴暗面吧
Well, let's just say you haven't seen it yet.

1008
01:09:13,903 --> 01:09:16,197
你知道奥创想让我们内讧 是吧?
You know Ultron is trying to tear us apart, right?

1009
01:09:16,239 --> 01:09:18,450
我猜你是知道的
Well, I guess you'd know.

1010
01:09:18,575 --> 01:09:19,909
你告不告诉我们才是个问题
Whether you'd tell us is a bit of a question.

1011
01:09:20,076 --> 01:09:21,202
班纳和我当时正在做研究
Banner and I were doing research.

1012
01:09:21,244 --> 01:09:23,580
- 那会影响团队  - 那会使团队解散!
- That would affect the team.  - That would end the team!

1013
01:09:23,663 --> 01:09:24,831
那不就是目标吗?
Isn't that the mission?

1014
01:09:24,956 --> 01:09:26,374
那我不就是我们战斗的原因吗?
Isn't that the "Why We Fight"?

1015
01:09:26,416 --> 01:09:28,710
那样我们就能结束战争 那样我们就可以回家!
So we can end the fight. So we get to go home!

1016
01:09:31,921 --> 01:09:34,341
每次有人试着在战争开始之前就赢得战争时
Every time someone tries to win a war before it starts,

1017
01:09:34,424 --> 01:09:37,177
就有无辜的人会牺牲 每次都是如此
innocent people die. Every time.

1018
01:09:39,554 --> 01:09:40,930
很抱歉
I'm sorry.

1019
01:09:40,972 --> 01:09:41,973
斯塔克先生...
Mr. Stark...

1020
01:09:42,807 --> 01:09:43,975
克林特说你不会介意
Clint said you wouldn't mind,

1021
01:09:44,059 --> 01:09:46,603
但是我们的拖拉机打不着火了
but our tractor doesn't seem to want to start at all.

1022
01:09:46,770 --> 01:09:49,105
- 我想或许你能...  - 好 我这就去修理
- I thought maybe you might...  - Yeah, I'll give her a kick.

1023
01:09:52,609 --> 01:09:54,277
不许碰我这堆
Don't take from my pile.

1024
01:10:04,454 --> 01:10:05,705
你好 亲爱的
Hello, Dear.

1025
01:10:08,500 --> 01:10:09,959
把一切情况都告诉我
Tell me everything.

1026
01:10:11,127 --> 01:10:12,629
你生什么病了?
What ails you?

1027
01:10:12,712 --> 01:10:13,797
帮我个忙
Do me a favor.

1028
01:10:15,882 --> 01:10:17,884
别让它活过来
Try not to bring it to life.

1029
01:10:18,009 --> 01:10:19,594
哎 巴顿夫人 你这个小贱人
Why, Ms. Barton, you little minx.

1030
01:10:19,969 --> 01:10:22,514
我知道了 玛丽亚·希尔打电话给你了 是吗?
I get it. Maria Hill called you, right?

1031
01:10:22,597 --> 01:10:23,932
她就没有不为你工作的时候吗?
Was she ever not working for you?

1032
01:10:23,973 --> 01:10:25,517
人工智能
Artificial intelligence.

1033
01:10:26,476 --> 01:10:28,311
你从没有犹豫过
You never even hesitated.

1034
01:10:28,436 --> 01:10:29,813
听着 今天已经很漫长了
Look, it's been a really long day,

1035
01:10:29,896 --> 01:10:31,564
跟尤金·奥尼尔的作品一样长
like Eugene O'Neill long,

1036
01:10:31,648 --> 01:10:33,650
所以我们只直接跳到你能帮上忙的部分吧
so how's about we skip to the part where you're useful.

1037
01:10:33,775 --> 01:10:36,444
看着我的眼 告诉我你会关掉他
Look me in the eye and tell me you're going to shut him down.

1038
01:10:36,569 --> 01:10:38,196
你又不是我老板
You're not the director of me.

1039
01:10:38,321 --> 01:10:40,115
我不是任何人的老板
I'm not the director of anybody.

1040
01:10:40,240 --> 01:10:42,158
我只是个老人
I'm just an old man

1041
01:10:42,325 --> 01:10:44,494
一个很关心你的老人
who cares very much about you.

1042
01:10:47,163 --> 01:10:49,124
我是那个杀了复仇者的人
And I'm the man who killed the Avengers.

1043
01:10:50,667 --> 01:10:52,043
我看到了
I saw it.

1044
01:10:52,127 --> 01:10:53,712
我没有告诉其他队员 怎么说得出扣?
I didn't tell the team. How could I?

1045
01:10:54,963 --> 01:10:56,840
我看到他们都死了 尼克 我能感觉到
I saw them all dead, Nick. I felt it.

1046
01:10:57,173 --> 01:10:58,717
整个世界都完蛋了
The whole world, too.

1047
01:10:59,092 --> 01:11:00,093
因为我
Because of me.

1048
01:11:01,761 --> 01:11:03,054
我还没准备好
I wasn't ready.

1049
01:11:04,305 --> 01:11:05,724
我没有尽自己所能
I didn't do all I could.

1050
01:11:06,683 --> 01:11:08,852
那个叫马克西莫夫的小女孩 她在操控你 斯塔克
Maximoff girl, she's working you, Stark.

1051
01:11:09,394 --> 01:11:10,437
利用你的恐惧玩弄你
Playing on your fear.

1052
01:11:10,520 --> 01:11:12,981
我没有被耍 我亲眼看到的
I wasn't tricked, I was shown.

1053
01:11:13,023 --> 01:11:15,275
那不是场噩梦 是我会留下的东西
Wasn't a nightmare, it was my legacy.

1054
01:11:15,400 --> 01:11:17,527
是我为团队引领的那条路的尽头
The end of the path I started us on.

1055
01:11:18,653 --> 01:11:21,531
你创造了很多令人印象深刻的发明 托尼
You come up with some pretty impressive inventions, Tony.

1056
01:11:23,033 --> 01:11:24,617
但不包括战争
War isn't one of them.

1057
01:11:27,912 --> 01:11:29,706
我亲眼看着我的朋友死去
I watched my friends die.

1058
01:11:29,748 --> 01:11:32,042
你觉得这很糟 是吗?
You'd think that'd be as bad as it gets, right?

1059
01:11:33,209 --> 01:11:34,711
不
Nope.

1060
01:11:35,628 --> 01:11:37,172
这还不是最糟的
It wasn't the worst part.

1061
01:11:37,213 --> 01:11:38,214
最糟糕的
The worst part

1062
01:11:39,132 --> 01:11:40,592
是你没有死
is that you didn't.

1063
01:11:47,223 --> 01:11:48,350
晚上见
I'll see you tonight.

1064
01:11:51,061 --> 01:11:52,395
我喜欢你的造型
I like the look.

1065
01:11:53,355 --> 01:11:56,149
如果你想试着变得不起眼的话 差点就成功了
If you're going for inconspicuous, though, near miss.

1066
01:11:56,316 --> 01:11:57,442
我需要你的帮助
I need your help.

1067
01:11:57,567 --> 01:11:58,735
被人需要真好
It's nice to be needed.

1068
01:11:58,860 --> 01:12:00,236
很危险
It's dangerous.

1069
01:12:00,987 --> 01:12:02,906
如果不危险 我才失望呢
I'd be disappointed if it wasn't.

1070
01:12:05,742 --> 01:12:09,329
奥创把你们这伙人踢出局是为了给他自己赢得更多时间
Ultron took you folks out of play to buy himself time.

1071
01:12:09,412 --> 01:12:12,415
我的眼线都说他正在制造什么东西
My contacts all say he's building something.

1072
01:12:12,457 --> 01:12:15,043
他偷走了大量的振金
The amount of vibranium he made off with,

1073
01:12:15,168 --> 01:12:16,586
我认为这只是其中之一
I don't think it's just one thing.

1074
01:12:16,711 --> 01:12:18,171
那奥创自己呢?
What about Ultron himself?

1075
01:12:18,254 --> 01:12:20,757
追踪他很容易 他无所不在
He's easy to track. He's everywhere.

1076
01:12:20,882 --> 01:12:23,551
这家伙比不避孕的兔子繁殖得还快
The guy is multiplying faster than a Catholic rabbit.

1077
01:12:24,094 --> 01:12:26,971
但我们仍无法看透他的计划
It still doesn't help us get an angle on any of his plans, though.

1078
01:12:27,055 --> 01:12:28,390
他还在找发射密码吗?
Is he still going after launch codes?

1079
01:12:28,431 --> 01:12:29,808
是的
Yes, he is.

1080
01:12:29,933 --> 01:12:31,434
但并没有任何进展
But he's not making any headway.

1081
01:12:31,559 --> 01:12:33,561
我高中时一冲动就攻破了五角大楼的防火墙
I cracked the Pentagon's firewall in high school on a dare.

1082
01:12:33,687 --> 01:12:36,231
我联系了在链结的朋友
Well, I contacted our friends at the Nexus about that.

1083
01:12:36,356 --> 01:12:37,440
链结?
Nexus?

1084
01:12:37,524 --> 01:12:39,442
它是奥斯陆的世界互联网中心
It's the world internet hub in Oslo.

1085
01:12:39,567 --> 01:12:41,569
每一字节数据流都流经那里
Every byte of data flows through there.

1086
01:12:41,611 --> 01:12:42,696
是全世界上最快的通路
Fastest access on Earth.

1087
01:12:42,779 --> 01:12:43,905
好吧 他们怎么说?
So, what did they say?

1088
01:12:44,030 --> 01:12:45,907
他对导弹非常着迷
He's fixated on the missiles.

1089
01:12:46,032 --> 01:12:47,784
但密码一直在改变
But the codes are constantly being changed.

1090
01:12:48,159 --> 01:12:49,577
谁改的?
By whom?

1091
01:12:50,787 --> 01:12:51,788
不明势力
Parties unknown.

1092
01:12:51,871 --> 01:12:53,039
我们有盟友吗?
Do we have an ally?

1093
01:12:53,123 --> 01:12:55,500
是奥创有了个敌人 那可不能混为一谈
Ultron's got an enemy. That's not the same thing.

1094
01:12:55,625 --> 01:12:57,711
我还是愿意花大价钱弄清他是谁
Still, I'd pay folding money to know who it is.

1095
01:12:57,794 --> 01:12:59,004
我可能得去趟奥斯陆
I might need to visit Oslo.

1096
01:12:59,462 --> 01:13:00,672
寻找这个不明势力
Find our unknown.

1097
01:13:00,755 --> 01:13:02,173
见到你很高兴 头儿
Well, this is good times, boss,

1098
01:13:02,257 --> 01:13:03,633
但我本希望你这次见到你
but I was kind of hoping when I saw you,

1099
01:13:03,758 --> 01:13:04,926
你会带来更多的东西
you'd have more than that.

1100
01:13:04,968 --> 01:13:07,137
确实 我还有你们
I do. I have you.

1101
01:13:07,846 --> 01:13:11,141
过去 我到处都有眼线耳目
Back in the day, I had eyes everywhere. Ears, everywhere else.

1102
01:13:11,307 --> 01:13:14,477
你们拥有顶尖的技术
You kids had all the tech you could dream up.

1103
01:13:15,437 --> 01:13:17,605
现在 我们都回到了地球
Here we all are, back on Earth,

1104
01:13:17,647 --> 01:13:21,192
只能靠我们的智慧和意志力来拯救世界
with nothing but our wit and our will to save the world.

1105
01:13:22,736 --> 01:13:24,988
奥创说复仇者是他完成使命的
Ultron says the Avengers are the only thing,

1106
01:13:25,071 --> 01:13:26,656
唯一阻碍
between him and his mission.

1107
01:13:26,781 --> 01:13:28,825
不管他承不承认
And whether or not he admits it,

1108
01:13:28,992 --> 01:13:31,745
他的使命就是毁灭全球
his mission is global destruction.

1109
01:13:32,912 --> 01:13:35,248
这一切 都将化为灰烬
All this, laid in a grave.

1110
01:13:37,042 --> 01:13:39,002
所以站出来吧
So stand.

1111
01:13:39,586 --> 01:13:41,504
用智慧战胜这金属混蛋
Outwit the platinum bastard.

1112
01:13:42,005 --> 01:13:43,673
史蒂夫不喜欢这样的话
Steve doesn't like that kind of talk.

1113
01:13:43,757 --> 01:13:44,758
你知道吗 罗曼诺夫?
You know what, Romanoff?

1114
01:13:45,842 --> 01:13:47,302
那么他想要什么?
So, what does he want?

1115
01:13:49,012 --> 01:13:50,764
变得更好
To become better.

1116
01:13:50,847 --> 01:13:52,265
比我们更好
Better than us.

1117
01:13:52,515 --> 01:13:53,933
他一直在制造身体 
He keeps building bodies.

1118
01:13:54,059 --> 01:13:55,477
人的身体
Person bodies.

1119
01:13:55,518 --> 01:13:57,187
人体的构成效率低下
The human form is inefficient.

1120
01:13:57,312 --> 01:13:59,481
从生物学上来讲 我们已经过时了
Biologically speaking, we're outmoded.

1121
01:13:59,606 --> 01:14:01,524
但他一直都想拥有人的身体
But he keeps coming back to it.

1122
01:14:01,608 --> 01:14:03,777
当你们俩给他编程去保护人类时
When you two programmed him to protect the human race,

1123
01:14:03,860 --> 01:14:05,362
你们完全失败了
you amazingly failed.

1124
01:14:05,445 --> 01:14:07,489
他们不需要被保护
They don't need to be protected.

1125
01:14:07,906 --> 01:14:09,657
他们需要进化
They need to evolve.

1126
01:14:11,534 --> 01:14:13,703
奥创想要进化
Ultron's going to evolve.

1127
01:14:13,828 --> 01:14:14,871
怎么进化?
How?

1128
01:14:16,206 --> 01:14:18,917
有人和海伦·周有联系吗?
Has anyone been in contact with Helen Cho?

1129
01:14:22,587 --> 01:14:24,255
它真美
It's beautiful.

1130
01:14:24,381 --> 01:14:27,676
振金原子不仅能与组织细胞共存
The vibranium atoms aren't just compatible with the tissue cells,

1131
01:14:27,717 --> 01:14:29,052
还能与之相结合
they're binding them.

1132
01:14:29,427 --> 01:14:30,970
神盾局甚至从没来想过...
And S.H.I.E.L.D. never even thought to...

1133
01:14:31,054 --> 01:14:33,598
这个星球上最万能的物质
The most versatile substance on the planet,

1134
01:14:33,682 --> 01:14:36,226
却被用来做飞盘
and they used it to make a Frisbee.

1135
01:14:36,309 --> 01:14:37,560
愚蠢的人类
Typical of humans.

1136
01:14:37,727 --> 01:14:40,230
他们触及表面 而从不
They scratch the surface and never think,

1137
01:14:42,107 --> 01:14:43,692
深入思考
to look within.

1138
01:14:54,202 --> 01:14:55,787
我会带上娜塔莎和克林特
I'll take Natasha and Clint.

1139
01:14:55,870 --> 01:14:59,124
好的 仔细侦察 我先去链结 然后尽快和你们会合
All right. Strictly recon. I'll hit the Nexus. I'll join you as soon as I can.

1140
01:14:59,207 --> 01:15:00,709
如果奥创真的在制造身体...
If Ultron's really building a body...

1141
01:15:00,834 --> 01:15:02,794
他会比我们中的任何一个都强大
He'll be more powerful than any of us.

1142
01:15:02,877 --> 01:15:03,920
甚至比我们加起来都要强大
Maybe all of us.

1143
01:15:04,087 --> 01:15:06,256
一个机器人设计了另外一个机器人
An android designed by a robot.

1144
01:15:06,297 --> 01:15:07,507
要知道 我真的很怀念过去
You know, I really miss the days,

1145
01:15:07,590 --> 01:15:09,884
当时科学最奇怪的产物还是我
when the weirdest thing science ever created was me.

1146
01:15:10,301 --> 01:15:12,012
我会在塔上放下班纳
I'll drop Banner off at the tower.

1147
01:15:12,095 --> 01:15:13,555
我可以借用希尔小姐吗?
You mind if I borrow Ms. Hill?

1148
01:15:13,596 --> 01:15:15,432
没问题 很显然
She's all yours. Apparently.

1149
01:15:15,515 --> 01:15:16,808
你打算怎么做?
What are you gonna do?

1150
01:15:16,891 --> 01:15:20,020
不知道 但愿来点有戏剧性的
I don't know. Something dramatic, I hope.

1151
01:15:23,273 --> 01:15:27,152
我一回来就会给日光室重新铺地板
I'm gonna finish reflooring that sunroom as soon as I get back.

1152
01:15:27,235 --> 01:15:29,946
是啊 然后你又会把房子的另一个部位给拆了
Yeah, then you'll find another part of the house to tear apart.

1153
01:15:30,030 --> 01:15:31,197
不会
No.

1154
01:15:31,865 --> 01:15:33,450
这是最后一个工程了
It's the last project.

1155
01:15:34,909 --> 01:15:35,952
我保证
I promise.

1156
01:15:54,179 --> 01:15:55,764
这就是了
So, this is it.

1157
01:15:57,307 --> 01:15:59,642
洞察之池
The Water of Sight.

1158
01:16:01,936 --> 01:16:04,356
在每一个国度都有倒影
In every realm, there's a reflection.

1159
01:16:05,482 --> 01:16:06,941
如果水中鬼神接受我
If the water's spirits accept me,

1160
01:16:06,983 --> 01:16:08,985
我就能回到梦境之中
I can return to my dream,

1161
01:16:09,736 --> 01:16:11,321
找寻我所错过了的
and find what I missed.

1162
01:16:11,446 --> 01:16:15,325
凡是进入这水池的人 都没有什么好下场
Men who enter that water, the legends don't end well.

1163
01:16:16,951 --> 01:16:18,787
一个比奥创还快的黑客?
A hacker who's faster than Ultron?

1164
01:16:18,828 --> 01:16:19,954
他可能在任何地方
He could be anywhere,

1165
01:16:19,996 --> 01:16:21,873
而且由于这里是一切的中心
and as this is the center of everything,

1166
01:16:22,999 --> 01:16:26,419
我只是个在世界上最大的海洋里捞一根针的人
I'm just a guy looking for a needle in the world's biggest haystack.

1167
01:16:26,795 --> 01:16:28,672
你怎么找?
How do you find it?

1168
01:16:28,755 --> 01:16:31,424
很简单 用磁铁
It's pretty simple. You bring a magnet.

1169
01:16:33,510 --> 01:16:34,678
我正在破解核弹发射密码
I'm decrypting nuclear codes,

1170
01:16:34,761 --> 01:16:36,137
而你却不想我这样做
and you don't want me to.

1171
01:16:38,390 --> 01:16:39,974
来抓我啊
Come and get me.

1172
01:16:52,028 --> 01:16:53,196
醒醒!
Wake up!

1173
01:17:00,078 --> 01:17:01,204
托尔!
Thor!

1174
01:17:01,996 --> 01:17:03,039
灭绝
Extinction.

1175
01:17:16,469 --> 01:17:18,722
细胞结合需要几个小时
Cellular cohesion will take a few hours,

1176
01:17:18,888 --> 01:17:21,266
但我们可以输入意识了
but we can initiate the consciousness stream.

1177
01:17:21,808 --> 01:17:24,686
我们在上传你的大脑矩阵
We're uploading your cerebral matrix,

1178
01:17:24,853 --> 01:17:26,104
现在
now.

1179
01:17:27,522 --> 01:17:29,149
我能读出他的思绪
I can read him.

1180
01:17:29,858 --> 01:17:31,443
他在做梦
He's dreaming.

1181
01:17:31,568 --> 01:17:33,403
我不会称之为梦
I wouldn't call it dreams.

1182
01:17:33,570 --> 01:17:35,447
那是奥创的基本意识
It's Ultron's base consciousness.

1183
01:17:35,572 --> 01:17:37,365
信息噪音 很快...
Informational noise. Soon...

1184
01:17:37,407 --> 01:17:38,742
有多快?
How soon?

1185
01:17:38,783 --> 01:17:40,243
我并不是在催你
I'm not being pushy.

1186
01:17:40,368 --> 01:17:42,078
我们在制造一个物理大脑
We're imprinting a physical brain.

1187
01:17:42,120 --> 01:17:43,747
并没有什么捷径
There are no shortcuts.

1188
01:17:43,872 --> 01:17:45,165
即使有你的魔法宝石...
Even if your magic gem...

1189
01:17:55,759 --> 01:17:56,760
你怎么可以?
How could you?

1190
01:17:57,218 --> 01:17:58,345
我怎么可以什么?
How could I what?

1191
01:17:58,470 --> 01:18:01,765
你说过我们会消灭复仇者
You said we would destroy the Avengers,

1192
01:18:01,848 --> 01:18:02,974
创造一个更好的世界
make a better world.

1193
01:18:03,099 --> 01:18:04,309
是会更美好
It will be better.

1194
01:18:05,268 --> 01:18:06,269
当所有的人都死了吗?
When everyone is dead?

1195
01:18:06,311 --> 01:18:07,604
那不是...
That is not...

1196
01:18:08,480 --> 01:18:12,400
人类会有无数的机会来进步
The human race will have every opportunity to improve.

1197
01:18:12,859 --> 01:18:13,860
如果他们不呢?
And if they don't?

1198
01:18:14,402 --> 01:18:15,528
去问诺亚
Ask Noah.

1199
01:18:16,696 --> 01:18:17,822
你是个疯子
You are a madman.

1200
01:18:17,906 --> 01:18:21,409
发生过好多次生物大灭绝事件
There were more than a dozen extinction-level events

1201
01:18:21,451 --> 01:18:24,621
恐龙就是那么灭绝的
before even the dinosaurs got theirs.

1202
01:18:24,662 --> 01:18:26,873
当地球上的生物进化停滞不前
When the Earth starts to settle,

1203
01:18:27,332 --> 01:18:29,292
上帝就会扔一块石头
God throws a stone at it.

1204
01:18:29,376 --> 01:18:31,711
相信我 他是要结束这一切了
And, believe me, he's winding up.

1205
01:18:32,462 --> 01:18:33,672
我们必须要进化
We have to evolve.

1206
01:18:34,214 --> 01:18:35,465
并没有空间
There's no room,

1207
01:18:36,216 --> 01:18:37,384
留给弱者
for the weak.

1208
01:18:37,467 --> 01:18:39,636
该由谁来决定谁是弱者呢?
And who decides who's weak?

1209
01:18:40,387 --> 01:18:42,222
生命
Life.

1210
01:18:42,681 --> 01:18:44,808
总是生命来决定
Life always decides.

1211
01:18:47,644 --> 01:18:48,645
有人来了
There's incoming.

1212
01:18:50,105 --> 01:18:52,399
昆式战斗机 我们得走了
The Quinjet. We have to move.

1213
01:18:52,524 --> 01:18:54,150
没问题
That's not a problem.

1214
01:18:59,823 --> 01:19:01,366
等等 各位!
Wait, guys!

1215
01:19:05,286 --> 01:19:06,746
他们会理解的
They'll understand.

1216
01:19:06,913 --> 01:19:09,165
等他们看到就会理解的
When they see, they'll understand.

1217
01:19:09,541 --> 01:19:12,794
再给我一点点时间
I just need a little more time.

1218
01:19:24,222 --> 01:19:26,349
两分钟 跟紧了
Two minutes. Stay close.

1219
01:19:33,481 --> 01:19:34,524
周博士!
Dr. Cho!

1220
01:19:38,445 --> 01:19:40,030
他正把自己上传到那具身体里
He's uploading himself into the body.

1221
01:19:40,071 --> 01:19:41,197
在哪儿?
Where?

1222
01:19:42,907 --> 01:19:45,618
真正的力量在再生摇篮里
The real power is inside the Cradle.

1223
01:19:45,702 --> 01:19:46,703
宝石
The gem,

1224
01:19:47,370 --> 01:19:50,165
它的力量是无法抑制的
its power is uncontainable.

1225
01:19:50,999 --> 01:19:52,709
不能把它炸掉
You can't just blow it up.

1226
01:19:53,585 --> 01:19:55,879
你必须把再生摇篮送到斯塔克那儿
You have to get the Cradle to Stark.

1227
01:19:55,920 --> 01:19:56,963
我得先找到它
First, I have to find it.

1228
01:19:57,339 --> 01:19:58,340
去吧
Go.

1229
01:19:58,631 --> 01:20:00,050
你们收到了吗?
Did you guys copy that?

1230
01:20:00,091 --> 01:20:01,176
收到
We did.

1231
01:20:01,301 --> 01:20:03,720
一架私人飞机在城市的另一边起飞了
I got a private jet taking off across town.

1232
01:20:04,095 --> 01:20:05,555
没有旅客
No manifest.

1233
01:20:05,680 --> 01:20:06,681
很可能就是他
That could be him.

1234
01:20:07,474 --> 01:20:09,184
在那儿 是实验室的卡车
There. It's a truck from the lab.

1235
01:20:09,309 --> 01:20:10,560
就在你上方 队长
Right above you, Cap.

1236
01:20:10,727 --> 01:20:12,520
在环形桥上
On the loop by the bridge.

1237
01:20:13,104 --> 01:20:14,189
是他们
It's them.

1238
01:20:14,230 --> 01:20:15,774
三个守着再生摇篮 一个在驾驶室里
You got three with the Cradle, one in the cab.

1239
01:20:16,816 --> 01:20:17,942
我可以干掉司机
I could take out the driver.

1240
01:20:18,026 --> 01:20:19,235
不行 如果卡车撞毁
Negative. That truck crashes,

1241
01:20:19,277 --> 01:20:21,071
宝石会将整个城市夷为平地
the gem could level the city.

1242
01:20:21,154 --> 01:20:23,740
我们得把奥创引开
We need to draw out Ultron.

1243
01:20:32,123 --> 01:20:34,334
不不不不
No, no, no, no.

1244
01:20:35,919 --> 01:20:37,087
别来烦我!
Leave me alone!

1245
01:20:45,679 --> 01:20:47,430
他很显然很不高兴
Well, he's definitely unhappy.

1246
01:20:47,514 --> 01:20:49,057
我要试着让他一直保持愤怒
I'm gonna try and keep him that way.

1247
01:20:49,182 --> 01:20:50,225
你不是他的对手 队长
You're not a match for him, Cap.

1248
01:20:51,643 --> 01:20:52,727
谢了 巴顿
Thanks, Barton.

1249
01:21:15,291 --> 01:21:16,459
你知道再生摇篮里是什么吗?
You know what's in that cradle?

1250
01:21:17,877 --> 01:21:19,671
真正改变一切的力量
The power to make real change.

1251
01:21:19,754 --> 01:21:21,214
而那让你恐惧
And that terrifies you.

1252
01:21:21,297 --> 01:21:22,382
可不会让你感觉太舒服
I wouldn't call it a comfort.

1253
01:21:25,802 --> 01:21:26,803
够了
Stop it.

1254
01:21:37,522 --> 01:21:40,316
可以出舱了 四 三...
We got a window. Four, three...

1255
01:21:40,900 --> 01:21:42,027
给他点颜色看看
Give him hell.

1256
01:21:52,829 --> 01:21:54,414
我总得给你们男人收拾烂摊子
I'm always picking up after you boys.

1257
01:21:55,915 --> 01:21:57,709
他们一直在立交桥下 我没法开枪
They're heading under the overpass. I've got no shot.

1258
01:21:57,959 --> 01:21:59,002
哪条路?
Which way?

1259
01:21:59,169 --> 01:22:00,253
你右边
Hard right.

1260
01:22:01,296 --> 01:22:02,297
现在
Now.

1261
01:22:33,286 --> 01:22:35,622
让开! 借过! 抱歉 借过!
Out of the way! Coming through! Sorry, coming through!

1262
01:22:51,388 --> 01:22:52,555
来吧!
Come on!

1263
01:22:53,515 --> 01:22:55,684
- 克林特 你能把守卫引开吗?  - 让我试试
- Clint, can you draw out the guards?  - Let's find out.

1264
01:22:56,643 --> 01:22:57,686
哔 哔!
Beep, beep!

1265
01:23:34,973 --> 01:23:36,641
他们回头朝你去了
They're heading back towards you.

1266
01:23:36,725 --> 01:23:38,101
所以不管你做什么 赶紧动手
So whatever you're gonna do, do it now.

1267
01:23:43,857 --> 01:23:46,526
我要进去了 队长 你能拖住他吗?
I'm going in. Cap, can you keep him occupied?

1268
01:23:47,318 --> 01:23:48,820
你以为我一直在干嘛啊?
What do you think I've been doing?

1269
01:24:32,072 --> 01:24:34,366
好吧 目标在空中
Okay, package is airborne.

1270
01:24:34,991 --> 01:24:36,159
我可以一枪命中
I have a clean shot.

1271
01:24:36,534 --> 01:24:37,952
不行 我还在卡车里
Negative. I am still in the truck.

1272
01:24:37,994 --> 01:24:38,995
- 你到底在...  - 你准备好就行
- What the hell are you...  - Just be ready.

1273
01:24:39,079 --> 01:24:40,121
我会把目标丢给你的
I'm sending the package to you.

1274
01:24:40,914 --> 01:24:42,165
你让我怎么接啊?
How do you want me to take it?

1275
01:24:42,999 --> 01:24:44,459
你可不会想知道的
You might wish you hadn't asked that.

1276
01:24:57,138 --> 01:24:59,057
求你 别这样
Please, don't do this.

1277
01:24:59,474 --> 01:25:01,184
我们还有别的选择吗?
What choice do we have?

1278
01:25:09,359 --> 01:25:10,360
他跑了!
I lost him!

1279
01:25:10,443 --> 01:25:11,903
朝你们去了!
He's headed your way!

1280
01:25:16,866 --> 01:25:17,867
娜塔莎 我们得走了
Nat, we gotta go.

1281
01:25:30,130 --> 01:25:31,589
娜塔莎!
Nat!

1282
01:25:35,051 --> 01:25:36,136
队长 看到娜塔莎了吗?
Cap, you see Nat?

1283
01:25:36,928 --> 01:25:39,723
如果你拿到包裹就去找斯塔克! 快走!
If you have the package, get it to Stark! Go!

1284
01:25:39,806 --> 01:25:41,057
你看到娜塔莎了吗?
Do you have eyes on Nat?

1285
01:25:41,141 --> 01:25:42,225
快走!
Go!

1286
01:25:44,144 --> 01:25:45,228
该死
Damn it.

1287
01:25:45,687 --> 01:25:46,896
前面有平民
Civilians in our path.

1288
01:25:48,064 --> 01:25:49,065
你能让车停下来吗?
Can you stop this thing?

1289
01:26:28,438 --> 01:26:29,814
我没事
I'm fine.

1290
01:26:29,898 --> 01:26:31,608
只是得休息一分钟
I just need to take a minute.

1291
01:26:32,067 --> 01:26:33,985
我可不想让你休息
I'm very tempted not to give you one.

1292
01:26:34,069 --> 01:26:36,029
你拿到再生摇篮了吗?
The Cradle. Did you get it?

1293
01:26:36,112 --> 01:26:37,614
斯塔克会处理的
Stark will take care of it.

1294
01:26:39,032 --> 01:26:40,033
不 他不会
No, he won't.

1295
01:26:43,453 --> 01:26:45,789
你不知道自己在说什么 斯塔克又不是疯子
You don't know what you're talking about. Stark's not crazy.

1296
01:26:45,872 --> 01:26:47,957
他会不惜一切代价做对的事情
He will do anything to make things right.

1297
01:26:52,921 --> 01:26:54,255
斯塔克 请回答
Stark, come in.

1298
01:26:54,673 --> 01:26:55,674
斯塔克
Stark.

1299
01:26:57,050 --> 01:26:58,218
有人收到吗?
Anyone on comms?

1300
01:26:58,343 --> 01:26:59,803
奥创并搞不清楚
Ultron can't tell the difference,

1301
01:26:59,886 --> 01:27:02,263
拯救世界和毁灭世界间的区别
between saving the world and destroying it.

1302
01:27:04,140 --> 01:27:06,643
你觉得他是跟谁学的?
Where do you think he gets that?

1303
01:27:08,812 --> 01:27:10,397
- 找到娜塔莎了吗?  - 还没有
- Anything on Nat?  - I haven't heard.

1304
01:27:10,480 --> 01:27:12,899
但她还活着 否则奥创肯定会落井下石
But she's alive, or Ultron would be rubbing our faces in it.

1305
01:27:12,982 --> 01:27:14,317
这是密封的
This is sealed tight.

1306
01:27:14,401 --> 01:27:15,944
我们得进入程序
We're gonna need to access the program,

1307
01:27:15,985 --> 01:27:17,987
从里面瓦解它
break it down from within.

1308
01:27:19,155 --> 01:27:21,991
娜塔莎有没有可能在互联网之外给你留了什么信息?
Any chance Natasha might leave you a message outside the Internet?

1309
01:27:22,075 --> 01:27:23,118
以前的间谍手段吗?
Old-school spy stuff?

1310
01:27:23,493 --> 01:27:25,328
我可以试试几个频率
There are some nets I can cast.

1311
01:27:25,453 --> 01:27:26,663
我会找到她的
Yeah, I'll find her.

1312
01:27:29,290 --> 01:27:31,084
我可以让组织瓦解
I can work on tissue degeneration,

1313
01:27:31,167 --> 01:27:34,462
前提是你能摧毁周博士植入的操作系统
if you could fry whatever operational system Cho implanted.

1314
01:27:34,504 --> 01:27:35,630
关于这一点
Yeah, about that.

1315
01:27:40,010 --> 01:27:41,094
不行
No.

1316
01:27:41,219 --> 01:27:43,138
- 你得相信我  - 我有点不相信
- You have to trust me. - Kind of don't.

1317
01:27:43,263 --> 01:27:47,600
我们的盟友 那个保护军方核密码的家伙
Our ally, the guy protecting the military's nuclear codes,

1318
01:27:49,227 --> 01:27:50,270
我找到他了
I found him.

1319
01:27:50,353 --> 01:27:51,479
你好 班纳博士
Hello, Dr. Banner.

1320
01:27:52,355 --> 01:27:54,607
奥创并不是由于愤怒才攻击贾维斯的
Ultron didn't go after Jarvis because he was angry.

1321
01:27:55,191 --> 01:27:58,862
而是由于害怕他的能力
He attacked him because he was scared of what he can do.

1322
01:27:59,946 --> 01:28:01,656
所以贾维斯转入了地下
So Jarvis went underground.

1323
01:28:01,698 --> 01:28:03,241
分散开 清除了记忆
Scattered, dumped his memory.

1324
01:28:03,783 --> 01:28:05,326
但他没忘了协议
But not his protocols.

1325
01:28:05,702 --> 01:28:09,205
直到我把拼接起来 他才知道自己在那里
He didn't even know he was in there until I pieced him together.

1326
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:16,838
所以 你要我帮你把贾维斯放入这玩意儿吗?
So, you want me to help you put Jarvis into this thing?

1327
01:28:16,963 --> 01:28:18,715
不! 当然不是 
No! Of course not.

1328
01:28:18,840 --> 01:28:20,550
是我想帮你把贾维斯放进去
I wanna help you put Jarvis in this thing.

1329
01:28:22,886 --> 01:28:24,596
这不是我擅长的领域
We're out of my field, here.

1330
01:28:24,679 --> 01:28:26,723
只有你最了解有机生物学
You know bio-organics better than anyone.

1331
01:28:26,890 --> 01:28:29,934
你觉得贾维斯的运算矩阵
And you just assume that Jarvis's operational matrix,

1332
01:28:30,018 --> 01:28:31,478
能打败奥创的?
can beat Ultron's?

1333
01:28:31,561 --> 01:28:34,898
贾维斯在无意识的情况下就已经从内部把他打败了
Jarvis has been beating him from inside without knowing it.

1334
01:28:34,981 --> 01:28:36,024
这是个好机会
This is the opportunity.

1335
01:28:36,066 --> 01:28:37,859
我们可以复制一个完美的奥创
We can create Ultron's perfect self,

1336
01:28:37,984 --> 01:28:41,529
摒弃他杀人成性的性格
without the homicidal glitches he thinks are his winning personality.

1337
01:28:41,571 --> 01:28:42,614
我们必须这么做
We have to.

1338
01:28:42,697 --> 01:28:43,740
我相信这值得一试
I believe it's worth a go.

1339
01:28:46,242 --> 01:28:47,327
我陷入了一个循环!
I'm in a loop!

1340
01:28:47,452 --> 01:28:48,536
一个时间上的循环
I'm caught in a time loop.

1341
01:28:48,578 --> 01:28:50,538
这就是所有事情都跑偏的原因
This is exactly where it all went wrong.

1342
01:28:50,580 --> 01:28:52,540
我知道 我知道 我知道大家都会说些什么
I know. I know. I know what everyone's gonna say.

1343
01:28:52,582 --> 01:28:54,584
但他们已经说了
But they're already saying it.

1344
01:28:55,085 --> 01:28:56,378
我们是科学怪人
We're mad scientists.

1345
01:28:57,045 --> 01:28:59,798
我们是怪物 哥们 我们早就是了
We're monsters, buddy. We've gotta own it.

1346
01:29:00,757 --> 01:29:02,050
下决心干吧
Make a stand.

1347
01:29:07,347 --> 01:29:08,932
这不是个循环
It's not a loop.

1348
01:29:10,100 --> 01:29:11,935
而是终点
It's the end of the line.

1349
01:29:32,372 --> 01:29:34,582
没想到你还能醒过来
I wasn't sure you would wake up.

1350
01:29:34,624 --> 01:29:38,128
我希望你能醒过来 我还想给你看呢
I hoped you would. I wanted to show you.

1351
01:29:38,253 --> 01:29:39,963
也没有其他人来看了
I don't have anyone else.

1352
01:29:42,716 --> 01:29:46,344
我想了很多关于陨石的事 它们有多纯洁
I think a lot about meteors. The purity in them.

1353
01:29:46,469 --> 01:29:48,138
嘭! 灰飞烟灭
Boom! The end.

1354
01:29:48,471 --> 01:29:49,973
一切重新开始
Start again.

1355
01:29:50,056 --> 01:29:52,017
一个崭新的世界
The world made clean

1356
01:29:52,142 --> 01:29:54,477
等待着它的新主人去重建
for the new man to rebuild.

1357
01:29:54,811 --> 01:29:56,980
我注定就是那新的主人
I was meant to be new.

1358
01:29:57,814 --> 01:30:00,442
我注定生来就是美丽的
I was meant to be beautiful.

1359
01:30:00,984 --> 01:30:03,111
这个世界抬头仰望苍穹时
The world would have looked to the sky

1360
01:30:03,153 --> 01:30:04,487
会看到希望
and seen hope,

1361
01:30:04,821 --> 01:30:06,156
以及宽恕
seen mercy.

1362
01:30:06,906 --> 01:30:09,034
相反的 因为你们
Instead, they'll look up in horror

1363
01:30:09,117 --> 01:30:10,535
他们却只能看到恐惧
because of you.

1364
01:30:10,660 --> 01:30:12,579
你打伤了我
You've wounded me.

1365
01:30:13,079 --> 01:30:14,831
这件事上我给你打满分
I give you full marks for that.

1366
01:30:15,415 --> 01:30:18,418
但是 正如人们所说的 凡不能毁灭我的...
But, like the man said, what doesn't kill me...

1367
01:30:23,506 --> 01:30:24,924
将使我更强大
just makes me stronger.

1368
01:31:05,006 --> 01:31:07,217
这个架构是不兼容的
This framework is not compatible.

1369
01:31:07,300 --> 01:31:10,053
遗传密码塔到了97%了
The genetic coding tower is at 97%.

1370
01:31:10,095 --> 01:31:14,015
你要把线路图在三分钟之内传上去
You have got to upload that schematic in the next three minutes.

1371
01:31:16,267 --> 01:31:18,228
- 这话我可只说一遍  - "一遍也别说"怎么样?
- I'm gonna say this once.  - How about "none-ce"?

1372
01:31:18,353 --> 01:31:20,397
- 把这玩儿给我关了!  - 门儿都没有 
- Shut it down!   - Nope, not gonna happen.

1373
01:31:20,480 --> 01:31:21,648
你们根本就不清楚自己在做什么
You don't know what you're doing.

1374
01:31:21,773 --> 01:31:23,149
你清楚?
And you do?

1375
01:31:23,483 --> 01:31:24,526
她没控制你吧?
She's not in your head?

1376
01:31:24,651 --> 01:31:26,319
我知道你很生气
I know you're angry.
1371 

1377
01:31:26,444 --> 01:31:27,862
比生气可严重多了
We're way past that.

1378
01:31:27,904 --> 01:31:30,365
我不变身都能把你给嚼了
I could choke the life out of you and never change a shade.

1379
01:31:30,490 --> 01:31:32,117
班纳 经过了所发生的一切... 
Banner, after everything that's happened...

1380
01:31:32,200 --> 01:31:33,743
这根本就不能和将要发生的事情相比!
It's nothing compared to what's coming!

1381
01:31:33,868 --> 01:31:35,328
- 你根本就不知道这是怎么一回事  - 这不是在玩游戏!
- You don't know what's in there.  - This isn't a game!

1382
01:31:39,499 --> 01:31:40,917
你们接着说
No, no. Go on.

1383
01:31:41,793 --> 01:31:43,086
你刚才说什么来着?
You were saying?

1384
01:31:49,634 --> 01:31:51,011
皮特!
Pietro!

1385
01:31:51,720 --> 01:31:52,721
怎么了?
What?

1386
01:31:53,096 --> 01:31:54,764
你没能提前发现吗?
You didn't see that coming?

1387
01:31:56,850 --> 01:31:58,059
我正在使用其它路径上传
I'm rerouting the upload.

1388
01:32:04,941 --> 01:32:06,109
接着来 把我惹急了试试
Go ahead, piss me off.

1389
01:32:18,371 --> 01:32:19,789
等等!
Wait!

1390
01:33:44,207 --> 01:33:46,543
很抱歉 刚才真是...
I am sorry. That was...

1391
01:33:47,502 --> 01:33:48,920
奇怪
odd.

1392
01:33:49,087 --> 01:33:50,422
谢谢
Thank you.

1393
01:33:55,343 --> 01:33:56,344
索尔
Thor.

1394
01:33:57,762 --> 01:33:58,805
你帮着把这东西创造出来了?
You helped create this?

1395
01:33:58,930 --> 01:34:00,432
我预见到一幅画面
I've had a vision.

1396
01:34:00,557 --> 01:34:04,394
有一个吞噬一切希望的漩涡 而这个东西则处于漩涡中心 
A whirlpool that sucks in all hope of life, and at its center is that.

1397
01:34:05,311 --> 01:34:06,396
什么? 这块宝石?
What? The gem?

1398
01:34:06,438 --> 01:34:07,522
这个叫做心灵之石
It's the Mind Stone.

1399
01:34:07,564 --> 01:34:09,065
是六块无限宝石其中的一颗
It's one of the six Infinity Stones.

1400
01:34:09,232 --> 01:34:10,525
是宇宙中最强大的能量
The greatest power in the universe,

1401
01:34:10,567 --> 01:34:12,819
有举世无双的破坏力
unparalleled in its destructive capabilities.

1402
01:34:12,902 --> 01:34:14,904
- 那你怎么会有...  - 因为斯塔克说得对
- Then why would you bring...  - Because Stark is right.

1403
01:34:15,030 --> 01:34:17,532
还真的是世界末日了
It's definitely the end times.

1404
01:34:17,657 --> 01:34:18,742
复仇者们是打不过奥创的
The Avengers cannot defeat Ultron.

1405
01:34:18,825 --> 01:34:20,160
孤军奋战不行
Not alone.

1406
01:34:20,618 --> 01:34:22,620
为什么幻视的声音听上去像贾维斯?
Why does your Vision sound like Jarvis?

1407
01:34:22,704 --> 01:34:25,373
我们重组了贾维斯的矩阵
We reconfigured Jarvis's matrix

1408
01:34:25,832 --> 01:34:27,709
创造出了一些新的东西
to create something new.

1409
01:34:27,876 --> 01:34:29,627
我觉得我身体的内部是崭新的
I think I've had my fill of new.

1410
01:34:29,711 --> 01:34:32,047
你们觉得我是奥创的后代
You think I'm a child of Ultron.

1411
01:34:32,339 --> 01:34:33,673
你不是吗?
You're not?

1412
01:34:34,758 --> 01:34:36,426
我不是奥创
I'm not Ultron.

1413
01:34:36,968 --> 01:34:39,262
也不是贾维斯 我...
I am not Jarvis. I am...

1414
01:34:41,306 --> 01:34:42,766
就是我
I am.

1415
01:34:44,601 --> 01:34:45,769
我进入了你的意识
I looked in your head

1416
01:34:46,436 --> 01:34:48,271
并且看到了毁灭
and saw annihilation.

1417
01:34:48,438 --> 01:34:49,439
再看看
Look again.

1418
01:34:49,856 --> 01:34:51,358
她这招在我看来一点用也没有
Her seal of approval means jack to me.

1419
01:34:51,858 --> 01:34:54,611
他们的力量 我们意识中的恐惧 奥创本身
Their powers, the horrors in our heads, Ultron himself,

1420
01:34:54,694 --> 01:34:56,112
都源于心灵之石
they all came from the Mind Stone.

1421
01:34:56,237 --> 01:34:58,448
但都无法与它能释放出的能量相比
And they're nothing compared to what it can unleash.

1422
01:34:58,573 --> 01:35:00,075
- 但是有了他的加入...  - 是吗? 
- But with it on our side...  - Is it?

1423
01:35:01,493 --> 01:35:02,744
你会加入吗?
Are you?

1424
01:35:03,536 --> 01:35:04,954
成为我们的同伴?
On our side?

1425
01:35:06,831 --> 01:35:08,792
我觉得这事没这么简单
I don't think it's that simple.

1426
01:35:08,875 --> 01:35:11,419
那最好快点把事情弄简单些
Well, it better get real simple real soon.

1427
01:35:12,504 --> 01:35:14,673
我站在生命这边
I am on the side of life.

1428
01:35:14,839 --> 01:35:16,299
但奥创不是
Ultron isn't.

1429
01:35:16,800 --> 01:35:18,301
他将毁灭一切
He will end it all.

1430
01:35:18,385 --> 01:35:20,387
那你还等什么?
What's you waiting for?

1431
01:35:20,470 --> 01:35:21,471
- 你  - 在哪?
- You.  - Where?

1432
01:35:21,888 --> 01:35:23,098
索科维亚
Sokovia.

1433
01:35:23,223 --> 01:35:24,307
他把娜塔莉也关在了那里
He's got Nat there, too.

1434
01:35:26,393 --> 01:35:28,061
如果我们看错了你
If we're wrong about you,

1435
01:35:30,730 --> 01:35:32,565
如果你是奥创创造出来的怪物...
if you're the monster that Ultron made you to be...

1436
01:35:33,233 --> 01:35:34,859
你将会怎么做?
What will you do?

1437
01:35:41,408 --> 01:35:43,576
我不想杀掉奥创
I don't want to kill Ultron.

1438
01:35:43,868 --> 01:35:47,288
他独一无二 并身负创伤
He's unique and he's in pain.

1439
01:35:48,790 --> 01:35:51,543
但是这种创伤会席卷全球
But that pain will roll over the Earth.

1440
01:35:51,710 --> 01:35:54,295
所以 他必须被干掉
So, he must be destroyed.

1441
01:35:54,421 --> 01:35:57,465
毁掉他一切可以存活的方式和全部的蛛丝马迹
Every form he's built, every trace of his presence on the net.

1442
01:35:57,590 --> 01:35:59,467
我们现在必须行动了
We have to act now.

1443
01:35:59,634 --> 01:36:03,638
并且要一起行动 离开谁也不行
And not one of us can do it without the others.

1444
01:36:05,640 --> 01:36:07,517
也许我是个怪物
Maybe I am a monster.

1445
01:36:07,684 --> 01:36:10,020
就算是 我也不知道
I don't think I'd know if I were one.

1446
01:36:11,146 --> 01:36:12,731
我和你们不同
I'm not what you are,

1447
01:36:13,356 --> 01:36:15,608
与你们的主张也不同
and not what you intended.

1448
01:36:16,276 --> 01:36:18,820
所以可能没办法让你们相信我
So, there may be no way to make you trust me.

1449
01:36:19,029 --> 01:36:20,530
但我们得出发了
But we need to go.

1450
01:36:35,253 --> 01:36:36,504
对
Right.

1451
01:36:37,047 --> 01:36:38,381
干得好
Well done.

1452
01:36:40,050 --> 01:36:41,092
三分钟时间
Three minutes.

1453
01:36:41,843 --> 01:36:43,511
做好准备
Get what you need.

1454
01:36:59,402 --> 01:37:00,403
晚上好 老板
Good evening, boss.

1455
01:37:05,533 --> 01:37:07,160
我们不可能全都熬过这个坎
No way we all get through this.

1456
01:37:07,285 --> 01:37:09,245
即使最后只剩下一个铁皮战士 也算我们输了 
If even one tin soldier is left standing, we've lost.

1457
01:37:10,080 --> 01:37:11,456
我们也只不过是地上的一滩血罢了
There's gonna be blood on the floor.

1458
01:37:11,581 --> 01:37:12,957
我也不知道明晚该怎么办
I got no plans tomorrow night.

1459
01:37:13,041 --> 01:37:14,250
我会先揍那大家伙一顿
I get first crack at the big guy.

1460
01:37:14,834 --> 01:37:16,419
他等的就是钢铁侠
Iron Man's the one he's waiting for.

1461
01:37:16,461 --> 01:37:18,922
说得对 他最恨你了
That's true. He hates you the most.

1462
01:37:24,219 --> 01:37:26,471
奥创知道我们会去
Ultron knows we're coming.

1463
01:37:26,596 --> 01:37:28,807
我们将会置身于枪林弹雨
Odds are we'll be riding into heavy fire.

1464
01:37:29,307 --> 01:37:31,101
这原本就是我们的使命
And that's what we signed up for.

1465
01:37:31,267 --> 01:37:34,104
但索科维亚的居民不必经历这些
But the people of Sokovia, they didn't.

1466
01:37:34,979 --> 01:37:36,523
所以我们的首要任务
So our priority

1467
01:37:37,148 --> 01:37:38,274
是疏散他们
is getting them out.

1468
01:37:38,358 --> 01:37:41,361
我们正遭受攻击! 疏散全城的人! 现在!
We're under attack! Clear the city! Now!

1469
01:37:49,202 --> 01:37:50,745
赶紧动起来
Get off your asses.

1470
01:37:51,913 --> 01:37:53,832
他们渴望的只是平静的生活而已
All they want is to live their lives in peace.

1471
01:37:54,416 --> 01:37:55,667
但在今天 这是不可能的
And that's not gonna happen today.

1472
01:37:57,377 --> 01:37:59,129
但我们会倾全力保护他们
But we can do our best to protect them.

1473
01:37:59,796 --> 01:38:01,423
并且也会完成好这项任务
And we can get the job done.

1474
01:38:04,718 --> 01:38:07,012
我们要找出奥创在建造什么
We find out what Ultron's been building,

1475
01:38:07,971 --> 01:38:09,639
也要找出罗曼诺夫
we find Romanoff,

1476
01:38:10,098 --> 01:38:11,975
然后我们清空这块区域
and we clear the field.

1477
01:38:13,309 --> 01:38:15,270
确保参战的只有我们和他
Keep the fight between us.

1478
01:38:21,985 --> 01:38:24,404
奥创觉得我们是怪物
Ultron thinks we're monsters.

1479
01:38:24,904 --> 01:38:27,365
我们就是这个世界的病灶
That we're what's wrong with the world.

1480
01:38:27,490 --> 01:38:29,826
这不仅仅关乎打败他
This isn't just about beating him.

1481
01:38:30,285 --> 01:38:32,370
这关乎他是否是对的
It's about whether he's right.

1482
01:38:38,793 --> 01:38:39,878
娜塔莎!
Natasha!

1483
01:38:41,004 --> 01:38:42,005
娜塔莎!
Natasha!

1484
01:38:42,088 --> 01:38:43,256
布鲁斯?
Bruce?

1485
01:38:44,549 --> 01:38:45,633
你还好吗?
You all right?

1486
01:38:45,675 --> 01:38:46,843
是的
Yeah.

1487
01:38:47,010 --> 01:38:48,678
队伍已经在城里了 天快亮了
The team is in the city. It's about to light up.

1488
01:38:48,845 --> 01:38:50,764
我觉得你还没找到那把静静地躺在某处的钥匙吧
I don't suppose you found a key lying around somewhere.

1489
01:38:51,264 --> 01:38:53,391
我找到了
Yeah. I did.

1490
01:38:59,814 --> 01:39:01,024
计划是怎么样的?
So what's our play?

1491
01:39:01,149 --> 01:39:02,525
我就是来救你出去的
I'm here to get you to safety.

1492
01:39:03,193 --> 01:39:04,194
任务还没完成呢
Job's not finished.

1493
01:39:04,361 --> 01:39:07,864
我们能帮助他们撤离 但我不能在离平民这么近的地方打斗
We could help with the evacuation, but I can't be in a fight near civilians.

1494
01:39:09,115 --> 01:39:10,367
而且你也做得够多了
And you've done plenty.

1495
01:39:12,702 --> 01:39:14,245
我们的任务结束了
Our fight is over.

1496
01:39:15,580 --> 01:39:18,291
那我们可以消失了?
So, we just disappear?

1497
01:39:22,587 --> 01:39:24,047
快点
Come on.

1498
01:39:28,593 --> 01:39:30,929
你要找的人在教堂 老板
Your man's in the church, boss.

1499
01:39:31,012 --> 01:39:32,889
我觉得他正在等你
I think he's waiting for you.

1500
01:39:36,893 --> 01:39:38,937
你是来忏悔的吗?
Come to confess your sins?

1501
01:39:39,062 --> 01:39:40,397
不知道 你有多长时间?
I don't know. How much time you got?

1502
01:39:40,438 --> 01:39:42,023
比你长
More than you.

1503
01:39:44,317 --> 01:39:47,195
你是不是长肉了? 喝了振金鸡尾酒吗?
Have you been juicing? Little vibranium cocktail?

1504
01:39:47,237 --> 01:39:49,572
你看上去... 我不想用"浮肿"这个词
You're looking... I don't wanna say "puffy".

1505
01:39:49,739 --> 01:39:51,408
你们在拖延时间 好去保护那些平民
You're stalling to protect the people.

1506
01:39:51,783 --> 01:39:54,786
这是我们的使命 你忘了吗?
Well, that is the mission. Did you forget?

1507
01:39:54,911 --> 01:39:57,414
我才不管你们的使命 我是自由的
I've moved beyond your mission. I'm free.

1508
01:40:02,210 --> 01:40:03,294
什么?
What?

1509
01:40:04,129 --> 01:40:06,548
你以为只有你们在拖延时间?
You think you were the only one stalling?

1510
01:40:07,257 --> 01:40:08,883
这是振金的剩余部分
There's the rest of the vibranium.

1511
01:40:08,925 --> 01:40:10,427
目前仍不清楚其作用
Function, still unclear.

1512
01:40:10,552 --> 01:40:12,262
托尼 你就要这么完蛋了
This is how you end, Tony.

1513
01:40:12,971 --> 01:40:14,764
这是属于我的时代和平
This is peace in my time.

1514
01:40:31,448 --> 01:40:32,490
快走!
Go!

1515
01:40:37,996 --> 01:40:39,414
快离开那座桥!
Get off the bridge!

1516
01:40:43,626 --> 01:40:44,627
快跑!
Run!

1517
01:40:46,588 --> 01:40:48,340
奥创
Ultron.

1518
01:40:53,845 --> 01:40:55,180
我亲爱的幻视
My Vision.

1519
01:40:55,305 --> 01:40:57,599
他们还真是把一切都从我身上夺走了
They really did take everything from me.

1520
01:40:57,724 --> 01:40:59,851
你定的规矩 你可以改变的
You set the terms. You can change them.

1521
01:40:59,976 --> 01:41:01,186
好吧
All right.

1522
01:41:25,335 --> 01:41:26,586
星期五 幻视呢?
Friday, the Vision?

1523
01:41:26,670 --> 01:41:27,712
老板 它成功了
Boss, it's working.

1524
01:41:27,796 --> 01:41:30,048
他正在摧毁奥创的网络 他跑不了了
He's burning Ultron out of the net. He won't escape through there.

1525
01:41:35,095 --> 01:41:36,513
你把网络断了
You shut me out.

1526
01:41:37,013 --> 01:41:38,306
你以为我会在意吗?
You think I care?

1527
01:41:40,225 --> 01:41:41,434
你夺走了我的世界
You take away my world,

1528
01:41:42,310 --> 01:41:44,229
我要夺走你的
I take away yours.

1529
01:42:28,565 --> 01:42:29,858
星期五
Friday.

1530
01:42:29,899 --> 01:42:32,402
索科维亚要飞起来了
Sokovia is going for a ride.

1531
01:42:44,831 --> 01:42:46,374
你们看到
Do you see

1532
01:42:46,791 --> 01:42:48,418
这其中的美了吗?
the beauty of it?

1533
01:42:48,918 --> 01:42:50,920
无法逃避的结局
The inevitability.

1534
01:42:51,004 --> 01:42:54,341
你们升起 却只为了坠落
You rise, only to fall.

1535
01:42:57,052 --> 01:43:00,722
复仇者们 你们就是我的陨石
You, Avengers, you are my meteor.

1536
01:43:00,764 --> 01:43:02,515
我轻快又锋利的刀刃
My swift and terrible sword.

1537
01:43:02,724 --> 01:43:04,267
会与你们的失败一起
And the earth will crack

1538
01:43:04,392 --> 01:43:06,269
划破大地
with the weight of your failure.

1539
01:43:07,979 --> 01:43:11,775
把我从你们的电脑中清除 操纵我的肉体与我为敌
Purge me from your computers, turn my own flesh against me.

1540
01:43:12,067 --> 01:43:13,151
都完全没用
It means nothing.

1541
01:43:13,777 --> 01:43:15,528
当一切尘埃落定之时
When the dust settles,

1542
01:43:15,612 --> 01:43:17,572
仅存于世的将会是
the only thing living in this world

1543
01:43:18,573 --> 01:43:19,616
冰冷的金属
will be metal.

1544
01:43:24,454 --> 01:43:25,789
我们得走了
We gotta move.

1545
01:43:26,122 --> 01:43:27,165
你不会变身吧?
You're not gonna turn green?

1546
01:43:27,374 --> 01:43:30,085
我已经得到了一个强迫自己不会失去冷静的理由
I've got a compelling reason not to lose my cool.

1547
01:43:30,377 --> 01:43:31,378
我爱你
I adore you.

1548
01:43:40,387 --> 01:43:42,555
但我需要的是另外一个家伙
But I need the other guy. 

1549
01:43:47,143 --> 01:43:48,978
让我们把任务完成吧
Let's finish the job.

1550
01:44:05,704 --> 01:44:07,080
希望咱俩这就算扯平了
I really hope this makes us even.

1551
01:44:09,416 --> 01:44:10,417
现在去做英雄吧
Now go be a hero.

1552
01:44:19,926 --> 01:44:21,928
振金的核心有一个磁场
The vibranium core's got a magnetic field.

1553
01:44:22,053 --> 01:44:24,055
就是它将岩石固定在一起
That's what's keeping the rock together.

1554
01:44:24,180 --> 01:44:25,181
要是它掉下来呢?
If it drops?

1555
01:44:25,265 --> 01:44:26,599
造成的冲击会立刻杀死成千上万的人
Right now, the impact will kill thousands.

1556
01:44:26,683 --> 01:44:29,352
一旦它升得足够高呢? 世界就毁灭了
Once it gets high enough? Global extinction.

1557
01:44:33,690 --> 01:44:35,859
那栋楼里面还有人 十楼
That building's not clear. The 10th floor.

1558
01:44:40,655 --> 01:44:41,656
嗨
Hi.

1559
01:44:42,782 --> 01:44:44,075
好吧
Okay.

1560
01:44:44,159 --> 01:44:45,160
全体进浴缸!
Get in the tub!

1561
01:44:52,000 --> 01:44:53,835
空中有敌人冲向大桥
I got airborne, heading up to the bridge.

1562
01:44:56,588 --> 01:44:57,881
队长 有敌人靠近你
Cap, you got incoming.

1563
01:44:58,048 --> 01:44:59,674
敌人早就都到了
Incoming already came in.

1564
01:45:02,344 --> 01:45:04,804
斯塔克 你要操心的就是让这个城市安全降落
Stark, you worry about bringing the city back down safely.

1565
01:45:05,472 --> 01:45:07,265
我们其余的人只有一件事情要做
The rest of us have one job,

1566
01:45:07,390 --> 01:45:08,641
就是把他们都撕成碎片
tear these things apart.

1567
01:45:08,933 --> 01:45:10,602
要是你受伤了 就以牙还牙
You get hurt, hurt them back.

1568
01:45:11,227 --> 01:45:12,395
你要是挂了
You get killed,

1569
01:45:13,396 --> 01:45:14,731
那就一边凉快去
walk it off.

1570
01:45:49,349 --> 01:45:50,350
快跑 快跑 快跑!
Go, go, go!

1571
01:45:56,022 --> 01:45:57,774
我都做了些什么?
How could I let this happen?

1572
01:45:57,941 --> 01:45:58,942
嘿 嘿 你还好吧?
Hey, hey, you okay?

1573
01:45:59,025 --> 01:46:00,068
这全都是我们的错
This is all our fault.

1574
01:46:00,110 --> 01:46:01,111
嘿 看着我
Hey, look at me.

1575
01:46:01,194 --> 01:46:03,488
你的错也好 大家的错也罢 可谁又在意这个呢?
It's your fault, it's everyone's fault. Who cares?

1576
01:46:03,571 --> 01:46:05,073
你愿意抗争吗?
Are you up for this?

1577
01:46:05,198 --> 01:46:06,199
愿意吗?
Are you?

1578
01:46:06,783 --> 01:46:09,953
听着 我只需要知道 因为这个城市已经飞了起来
Look, I just need to know. Because the city is flying.

1579
01:46:10,245 --> 01:46:14,165
好的 听着 这个城市已经飞起来了 我们正在与机器人大军战斗
Okay. Look, the city is flying, we're fighting an army of robots,

1580
01:46:15,000 --> 01:46:16,292
我只有弓箭
and I have a bow and arrow.

1581
01:46:16,376 --> 01:46:17,502
这些都没有什么意义
None of this makes sense.

1582
01:46:20,755 --> 01:46:22,841
但我还是会出去战斗 因为这是我的职责
But I'm going back out there because it's my job.

1583
01:46:23,717 --> 01:46:26,469
懂吗? 而且我不能又打仗 又照顾你
Okay? And I can't do my job and babysit.

1584
01:46:26,511 --> 01:46:29,639
你做过什么 以前是谁 这些都无关紧要
It doesn't matter what you did or what you were.

1585
01:46:29,806 --> 01:46:32,308
如果你从这里走出去 你就得至死战斗
If you go out there, you fight, and you fight to kill.

1586
01:46:33,351 --> 01:46:35,979
待在这里你会没事 我会让你弟弟来找你
Stay in here, you're good. I'll send your brother to come find you.

1587
01:46:36,062 --> 01:46:37,939
可一旦你走出了这扇门
But if you step out that door,

1588
01:46:38,815 --> 01:46:39,858
你就是一名复仇者
you are an Avenger.

1589
01:46:44,696 --> 01:46:46,531
好吧 我说完了
All right. Good chat.

1590
01:46:50,285 --> 01:46:51,327
这城市已经飞了起来
Yeah, the city is flying.

1591
01:47:25,320 --> 01:47:26,446
我抓住你了!
I got you!

1592
01:47:26,821 --> 01:47:28,073
看着我!
Just look at me!

1593
01:47:34,829 --> 01:47:36,164
你们拯救不了所有的人
You can't save them all.

1594
01:47:37,624 --> 01:47:38,625
你们绝不会...
You'll never...

1595
01:47:39,626 --> 01:47:40,627
"绝不会"什么?
"Never" what?

1596
01:47:40,919 --> 01:47:42,212
你还没说完呢!
You didn't finish!

1597
01:47:45,965 --> 01:47:47,592
你是跑去睡觉了吗?
What, were you napping?

1598
01:48:09,072 --> 01:48:10,073
索尔
Thor.

1599
01:48:12,742 --> 01:48:14,285
你吵到我了
You're bothering me.

1600
01:48:49,696 --> 01:48:50,947
好了 我们这里已经搞定了
All right, we're all clear here.

1601
01:48:50,989 --> 01:48:52,157
这边还没完!
We are not clear!

1602
01:48:52,240 --> 01:48:53,700
还有很多敌人!
We are very not clear!

1603
01:48:56,536 --> 01:48:57,537
好吧 马上过去支援
All right, coming to you.

1604
01:48:58,496 --> 01:48:59,831
快跟上 老男人!
Keep up, old man!

1605
01:49:02,334 --> 01:49:03,918
反正没人知道
Nobody would know.

1606
01:49:04,669 --> 01:49:05,795
没人
Nobody.

1607
01:49:07,630 --> 01:49:10,633
"上次见他 他还是奥创的小喽啰"
"The last I saw him, an Ultron was sitting on him."

1608
01:49:10,800 --> 01:49:12,635
"是啊 我们会想念他的 那个飞速崽"
"Yeah, he'll be missed, that quick little bastard."

1609
01:49:12,719 --> 01:49:13,720
"我已经想他了"
"I miss him already."

1610
01:49:29,235 --> 01:49:30,445
别开火!
Hold your fire!

1611
01:49:40,330 --> 01:49:41,331
罗曼诺夫!
Romanoff!

1612
01:49:41,831 --> 01:49:42,874
谢了! 
Thanks!

1613
01:49:52,258 --> 01:49:53,927
反重力推进让整座岛屿上升
The anti-gravs are rigged to flip.

1614
01:49:54,010 --> 01:49:56,221
一旦触碰 就会反向加速
Touch them, they'll go full reverse thrust.

1615
01:49:56,304 --> 01:49:57,764
城市下落速度会很快
The city's not coming down slow.

1616
01:49:57,847 --> 01:49:58,890
尖部还是振金做的
Spire is Vibranium.

1617
01:49:58,973 --> 01:50:00,350
如果让索尔去攻击...
If I get Thor to hit it...

1618
01:50:00,433 --> 01:50:01,893
那尖部就会被破坏 但不够
It will crack. That's not enough.

1619
01:50:01,976 --> 01:50:03,520
下落的冲击仍然是毁灭性的
The impact would still be devastating.

1620
01:50:03,603 --> 01:50:04,938
也许我们可以封住另一端
Maybe if we can cap the other end.

1621
01:50:05,188 --> 01:50:06,856
让原子撞击反向加倍
Keep the atomic action doubling back.

1622
01:50:06,940 --> 01:50:08,274
巨大的能量会使城市蒸发
That could vaporize the city.

1623
01:50:09,275 --> 01:50:11,194
里面的所有人都会死
And everyone on it.

1624
01:50:16,991 --> 01:50:18,868
下拨敌人随时会进攻
The next wave is gonna hit any minute.

1625
01:50:18,952 --> 01:50:20,870
- 有什么好主意 斯塔克?  - 还没
- What do you got, Stark?  - Nothing great.

1626
01:50:21,746 --> 01:50:24,040
除非把整个城市炸了
Maybe a way to blow up the city.

1627
01:50:24,082 --> 01:50:25,458
那样地球才不会受到撞击
That'll keep it from impacting the surface,

1628
01:50:25,542 --> 01:50:26,626
要是你们能脱身的话
if you guys can get clear.

1629
01:50:26,793 --> 01:50:28,670
我要解决方案 而不是撤离方案
I asked for a solution, not an escape plan.

1630
01:50:28,795 --> 01:50:31,881
城市升得越高 冲击影响半径就越大
Impact radius is getting bigger every second.

1631
01:50:32,048 --> 01:50:33,383
我们必须做出选择
We're gonna have to make a choice.

1632
01:50:34,050 --> 01:50:35,719
队长 这里的人是走不了的
Cap, these people are going nowhere.

1633
01:50:36,469 --> 01:50:37,929
如果斯塔克能炸掉这块石头...
If Stark finds a way to blow this rock...

1634
01:50:38,013 --> 01:50:39,014
必须等所有人都安全了
Not till everyone's safe.

1635
01:50:39,723 --> 01:50:42,767
选择救这里的人或是下面的所有人? 结果很明显  
Everyone up here versus everyone down there? There's no math there.

1636
01:50:42,892 --> 01:50:44,686
只要这里还有人 我是不会走的
I'm not leaving this rock with one civilian on it.

1637
01:50:44,811 --> 01:50:46,312
我没说我们要走
I didn't say we should leave.

1638
01:50:49,232 --> 01:50:51,109
至少这种死法没那么惨
There's worse ways to go.

1639
01:50:56,489 --> 01:50:58,992
谁临死前能欣赏到这样的风景呢?
Where else am I gonna get a view like this?

1640
01:50:59,868 --> 01:51:02,412
很高兴你喜欢这风景 罗曼诺夫
Glad you like the view, Romanoff.

1641
01:51:02,579 --> 01:51:04,080
风景马上会更好的
It's about to get better.

1642
01:51:28,271 --> 01:51:29,439
不赖吧?
Nice, right?

1643
01:51:29,606 --> 01:51:32,108
特地从老朋友那里弄来的后备舰
Pulled her out of mothballs with a couple of old friends.

1644
01:51:32,150 --> 01:51:33,777
虽然灰尘很大 但还能用
She's dusty, but she'll do.

1645
01:51:34,152 --> 01:51:35,612
弗瑞 你个老混蛋
Fury, you son of a bitch.

1646
01:51:35,945 --> 01:51:38,114
你用那脏嘴去问候你老妈的?
You kiss your mother with that mouth?

1647
01:51:38,239 --> 01:51:40,492
高度18000 仍在攀升
Altitude is 18,000 and climbing.

1648
01:51:40,617 --> 01:51:42,118
救生艇准备就绪 
Lifeboats secure to deploy.

1649
01:51:42,160 --> 01:51:44,913
发射倒数 三 二...
Disengage in three, two...

1650
01:51:46,081 --> 01:51:47,082
放出去了
Take them out.

1651
01:51:56,716 --> 01:51:58,343
这是神盾局?
This is S.H.I.E.L.D.?

1652
01:51:58,426 --> 01:52:00,887
这是神盾局应有的样子
This is what S.H.I.E.L.D. is supposed to be.

1653
01:52:02,472 --> 01:52:03,932
并不坏嘛
This is not so bad.

1654
01:52:07,185 --> 01:52:08,520
快让他们上去
Let's load them up.

1655
01:52:13,942 --> 01:52:17,821
长官 有几个机器人从右侧面接近
Sir, we have multiple bogies converging on our starboard flank.

1656
01:52:18,113 --> 01:52:19,322
让他们尝尝厉害
Show 'em what we got.

1657
01:52:19,739 --> 01:52:20,740
到你出场了
You're up.

1658
01:52:25,954 --> 01:52:26,996
好爽!
Yes!

1659
01:52:27,163 --> 01:52:28,957
这肯定会是很好的谈资
Now this is gonna be a good story.

1660
01:52:31,584 --> 01:52:33,670
是啊 如果你能活下来的话
Yup. If you live to tell it.

1661
01:52:33,795 --> 01:52:35,880
你认为我掌握不了吗?
You think I can't hold my own?

1662
01:52:35,964 --> 01:52:37,507
打赢这场 我帮你握着
We get through this, I'll hold your own.

1663
01:52:37,632 --> 01:52:39,551
你非要说得这么基干嘛
You had to make it weird.

1664
01:52:44,347 --> 01:52:47,350
这组人后面大约还有50到100人要来
I got about 50 to 100 more coming in after this group.

1665
01:53:04,200 --> 01:53:05,702
我们走 我们走 快点
Here we go. Here we go. Let's move.

1666
01:53:06,077 --> 01:53:07,078
快点走 各位!
Let's go, everyone!

1667
01:53:09,581 --> 01:53:11,666
六号仓满员锁仓...
Number six boat is topped and locked...

1668
01:53:11,708 --> 01:53:14,169
填满... 满员..
Or stocked... Topped...

1669
01:53:14,669 --> 01:53:16,087
总之满员了
It's full of people.

1670
01:53:17,839 --> 01:53:18,923
敌人!
Incoming!

1671
01:53:21,926 --> 01:53:23,053
天啊!
Oh, God!

1672
01:53:33,521 --> 01:53:34,773
你认为你救得了谁?
You think you're saving anyone?

1673
01:53:36,608 --> 01:53:38,943
我只要转动这个按钮早那么一点
I turn that key and drop this rock a little early

1674
01:53:39,027 --> 01:53:40,904
仍然要死上数十亿人
and it's still billions dead.

1675
01:53:41,321 --> 01:53:42,447
哪怕是你也无法阻止
Even you can't stop that.

1676
01:53:42,572 --> 01:53:45,200
我是索尔 奥丁之子
I am Thor, son of Odin,

1677
01:53:45,241 --> 01:53:47,494
只要我还有一口气...
and as long as there is life in my breast...

1678
01:53:47,660 --> 01:53:50,080
我快没词说了!
I am running out of things to say!

1679
01:53:50,163 --> 01:53:51,164
你准备好了吗?
Are you ready?

1680
01:53:58,838 --> 01:53:59,964
锤子受力好平均
It's terribly well-balanced.

1681
01:54:00,340 --> 01:54:03,843
如果锤子太重的话 你挥起来就太费力了...
Well, if there's too much weight, you lose power on the swing, so...

1682
01:54:04,761 --> 01:54:07,472
我想到了 弄一个热隔绝罩
I got it. Create a heat seal.

1683
01:54:07,847 --> 01:54:08,848
我可以...
I could...

1684
01:54:08,973 --> 01:54:11,351
从底部向岛核心充电让其过载
I could supercharge the spire from below.

1685
01:54:11,476 --> 01:54:12,727
计算结果
Running numbers.

1686
01:54:22,737 --> 01:54:24,781
如果能量够的话 热隔绝罩可让众人平安
A heat seal could work with enough power.

1687
01:54:24,864 --> 01:54:26,866
- 索尔 我有计划  - 快没时间了
- Thor, I got a plan.  - We're out of time.

1688
01:54:26,991 --> 01:54:28,326
他们正试图接近核心
They're coming for the core.

1689
01:54:28,410 --> 01:54:30,286
罗迪 快将剩余的人送上船
Rhodey, get the rest of the people on board that carrier.

1690
01:54:30,328 --> 01:54:31,329
收到
On it.

1691
01:54:31,413 --> 01:54:33,623
复仇者们 是时候为生存而战了
Avengers, time to work for a living.

1692
01:54:42,632 --> 01:54:43,967
- 你还好吗?  - 恩
- Are you good?  - Yeah.

1693
01:54:45,385 --> 01:54:46,469
罗曼诺夫
Romanoff.

1694
01:54:46,636 --> 01:54:49,139
你和班纳最好别现在卿卿我我
You and Banner better not be playing "hide the zucchini."

1695
01:54:49,180 --> 01:54:50,181
放松 铁头人
Relax, shellhead.

1696
01:54:50,515 --> 01:54:52,058
并不是所有人都会飞
Not all of us can fly.

1697
01:54:57,731 --> 01:54:59,482
- 什么策略?  - 保护这个
- What's the drill?  - This is the drill.

1698
01:54:59,566 --> 01:55:01,776
如果奥创碰到这个 我们输了
If Ultron gets a hand on the core, we lose.

1699
01:55:06,322 --> 01:55:08,324
你就这点能耐?
Is that the best you can do?

1700
01:55:18,209 --> 01:55:19,753
你真是多嘴
You had to ask.

1701
01:55:19,878 --> 01:55:22,297
这才是我的能耐
This is the best I can do.

1702
01:55:22,339 --> 01:55:24,007
我正想这样
This is exactly what I wanted.

1703
01:55:24,341 --> 01:55:25,675
你们所有人
All of you

1704
01:55:25,842 --> 01:55:27,510
对阵我的大军
against all of me.

1705
01:55:27,677 --> 01:55:29,888
你们怎么可能赢?
How can you possibly hope to stop me?

1706
01:55:30,680 --> 01:55:32,640
就像老家伙说的...
Well, like the old man said...

1707
01:55:33,933 --> 01:55:34,976
并肩作战
Together.

1708
01:57:03,898 --> 01:57:06,317
那么 我再啰嗦一句...
You know, with the benefit of hindsight...

1709
01:57:15,493 --> 01:57:16,619
它们想逃离这座城市
They'll try to leave the city.

1710
01:57:16,703 --> 01:57:18,413
不能让它们跑了 一个都不行 罗迪
We can't let them, not even one. Rhodey.

1711
01:57:18,830 --> 01:57:19,831
收到了
I'm on it.

1712
01:57:20,248 --> 01:57:21,624
不 我没说你们可以走
No. I didn't say you could leave.

1713
01:57:22,208 --> 01:57:24,377
战争机器来啦! 就在...
War Machine coming at you! Right...

1714
01:57:30,675 --> 01:57:32,135
好吧 那是谁?
Okay, what?

1715
01:57:32,302 --> 01:57:34,387
我们得撤离了 空气越来越稀薄了
We gotta move out. Even I can tell the air is getting thin.

1716
01:57:34,471 --> 01:57:35,805
你们去救生艇
You guys get to the boats.

1717
01:57:35,889 --> 01:57:37,682
我去清除逃兵 然后再赶来
I'll sweep for stragglers. Be right behind you.

1718
01:57:37,807 --> 01:57:39,225
那这个核心怎么办?
What about the core?

1719
01:57:39,392 --> 01:57:40,393
我来保护它
I'll protect it.

1720
01:57:42,312 --> 01:57:43,313
这是我的责任
It's my job.

1721
01:57:44,522 --> 01:57:45,523
娜塔莉
Nat.

1722
01:57:45,857 --> 01:57:46,900
走这边
This way.

1723
01:57:51,279 --> 01:57:52,572
去把人们送上船
Get the people on the boats.

1724
01:57:52,655 --> 01:57:53,656
我不会丢下你在这里
I'm not going to leave you here.

1725
01:57:53,740 --> 01:57:54,866
我可以处理
I can handle this.

1726
01:57:57,118 --> 01:57:58,411
等所有人都走了 再回来找我
Come back for me when everyone else is off.

1727
01:57:58,536 --> 01:57:59,704
那之前都别过来
Not before.

1728
01:58:00,288 --> 01:58:01,831
懂了吗?
You understand?

1729
01:58:02,832 --> 01:58:04,542
你知道吗? 我比你大12分钟
You know, I'm 12 minutes older than you.

1730
01:58:04,751 --> 01:58:06,044
去吧
Go.

1731
01:58:07,629 --> 01:58:09,172
老板 能量级别远小于...
Boss, power levels are way below...

1732
01:58:09,214 --> 01:58:11,424
重新分配能源 我们只有一次机会
Reroute everything. We get one shot at this.

1733
01:58:16,304 --> 01:58:17,639
我知道该怎么办了
I know what I need to do.

1734
01:58:17,931 --> 01:58:19,015
问题是餐厅
The dining room.

1735
01:58:19,307 --> 01:58:20,517
如果把东面那堵墙拆了
If I knock out that east wall,

1736
01:58:21,184 --> 01:58:22,727
那么劳拉做饭地方就变大了 对吧?
it'd make a nice workspace for Laura, huh?

1737
01:58:24,270 --> 01:58:25,522
弄些隔板
Put up some baffling.

1738
01:58:25,563 --> 01:58:27,691
这样孩子跑来跑起也不会吵到她 你觉得如何?
She can't hear the kids running around. What do you think?

1739
01:58:27,774 --> 01:58:29,067
挺好 反正你们总在厨房吃
You guys always eat in the kitchen anyway.

1740
01:58:29,150 --> 01:58:30,735
没人在餐厅吃饭
No one eats in a dining room.

1741
01:58:36,408 --> 01:58:37,450
时间不多了
We don't have a lot of time.

1742
01:58:38,034 --> 01:58:40,078
你快去救生艇上
So get your ass on a boat.

1743
01:58:52,966 --> 01:58:54,175
嘿 大家伙
Hey, big guy.

1744
01:58:55,885 --> 01:58:57,679
太阳快下山了
Sun's getting real low.

1745
01:58:58,221 --> 01:59:00,890
你现在安全了 你会没事的 系上安全带
You're safe now. You're gonna be okay. Buckle up.

1746
01:59:03,393 --> 01:59:05,020
保管好你的物品 找个座位
Secure your gear, find a seat.

1747
01:59:05,061 --> 01:59:06,396
科斯特!
Costel!

1748
01:59:07,397 --> 01:59:08,648
我们本来在集市的
We were in the market.

1749
01:59:08,773 --> 01:59:09,816
科斯特!
Costel!

1750
01:59:24,414 --> 01:59:26,458
索尔 我要你回到教堂那里
Thor, I'm gonna need you back in the church.

1751
01:59:26,624 --> 01:59:28,084
- 是最后一批了吗?  - 是的
- Is this the last of them?  - Yeah.

1752
01:59:28,460 --> 01:59:29,502
其他人都上船了
Everyone else is on the carrier.

1753
01:59:29,586 --> 01:59:30,754
知道吗 如果成功
You know, this works,

1754
01:59:31,379 --> 01:59:32,756
我们也许会来不及撤离
we maybe don't walk away.

1755
01:59:33,465 --> 01:59:34,549
也许不会
Maybe not.

1756
01:59:53,693 --> 01:59:57,280
# 我无所束缚 便要及时行乐 #
# I got no strings, so I have fun #

1757
01:59:57,697 --> 02:00:00,492
# 再也不受别人牵绊 #
# I'm not tied up to anyone #

1758
02:00:01,951 --> 02:00:03,328
快点 该撤离了
Come on. Time to go.

1759
02:00:35,777 --> 02:00:37,862
你没能提前发现吗?
You didn't see that coming?

1760
02:01:34,044 --> 02:01:35,879
怎么又是你
For God's sake.

1761
02:01:52,062 --> 02:01:53,938
-妈妈!  - 科斯特! 宝贝!
- Zrinka!  - Costel! Baby!

1762
02:02:06,326 --> 02:02:07,369
不 不 我没事
No, no, I'm fine.

1763
02:02:07,494 --> 02:02:08,578
没事
Fine.

1764
02:02:10,413 --> 02:02:12,499
今天真累
It's been a long day.

1765
02:02:26,971 --> 02:02:28,264
旺达
Wanda.

1766
02:02:28,932 --> 02:02:32,227
如果你待在这 你会死的
If you stay here, you'll die.

1767
02:02:33,728 --> 02:02:35,188
我已经死了
I just did.

1768
02:02:35,939 --> 02:02:37,649
你知道这感觉如何?
Do you know how it felt?

1769
02:02:51,788 --> 02:02:54,082
就是这样的感觉
It felt like that.

1770
02:03:29,075 --> 02:03:30,744
索尔 听我命令
Thor, on my mark.

1771
02:03:45,842 --> 02:03:46,843
动手!
Now!

1772
02:04:14,871 --> 02:04:17,248
嘿 大家伙 我们成功了
Hey, big guy. We did it.

1773
02:04:18,291 --> 02:04:19,959
任务结束了
The job is finished.

1774
02:04:20,210 --> 02:04:22,879
现在我要你驾驶这架飞机调头 好吗?
Now I need you to turn this bird around, okay?

1775
02:04:27,133 --> 02:04:28,968
在隐形模式下 我们找不到你
We can't track you in stealth mode.

1776
02:04:31,054 --> 02:04:33,306
帮帮我 我需要你...
So help me out. I need you...

1777
02:05:18,893 --> 02:05:19,978
你害怕了
You're afraid.

1778
02:05:20,895 --> 02:05:21,938
害怕你?
Of you?

1779
02:05:22,647 --> 02:05:23,898
害怕死亡
Of death.

1780
02:05:24,524 --> 02:05:26,401
你是最后一个
You're the last one.

1781
02:05:26,568 --> 02:05:29,112
你才是最后一位
You were supposed to be the last.

1782
02:05:29,279 --> 02:05:31,614
斯塔克想要一位救世主
Stark asked for a savior

1783
02:05:32,532 --> 02:05:34,284
却制造了一个奴隶
and settled for a slave.

1784
02:05:34,367 --> 02:05:36,870
我猜我们都让世人失望了
I suppose we are both disappointments.

1785
02:05:39,205 --> 02:05:40,457
我想是的
I suppose we are.

1786
02:05:41,207 --> 02:05:42,375
人类很奇怪
Humans are odd.

1787
02:05:44,210 --> 02:05:47,922
他们认为秩序和混乱是两个极端
They think order and chaos are somehow opposites

1788
02:05:49,591 --> 02:05:50,967
还试图控制力量之外的东西
and try to control what won't be.

1789
02:05:52,635 --> 02:05:55,138
但他们的失败值得尊敬
But there is grace in their failings.

1790
02:05:55,472 --> 02:05:57,432
我想你没注意到
I think you missed that.

1791
02:05:58,016 --> 02:05:59,184
他们注定灭亡
They're doomed.

1792
02:06:00,018 --> 02:06:01,144
是的
Yes.

1793
02:06:05,273 --> 02:06:08,276
但事物的美并不在于能否长存
But a thing isn't beautiful because it lasts.

1794
02:06:10,278 --> 02:06:12,364
能成为其中一员 我很荣幸
It's a privilege to be among them.

1795
02:06:12,489 --> 02:06:15,116
你真是天真到无法忍受
You're unbearably naive.

1796
02:06:15,325 --> 02:06:16,618
好吧...
Well...

1797
02:06:18,620 --> 02:06:20,747
我昨天才出生的
I was born yesterday.

1798
02:07:33,236 --> 02:07:34,320
瞧! 向娜塔莉阿姨问好!
Look! Say hi to Auntie Nat!

1799
02:07:36,740 --> 02:07:37,824
胖嘟嘟的
Fat.

1800
02:07:38,908 --> 02:07:40,118
有个技术人员追踪到这个
One of our tech boys flagged this.

1801
02:07:41,161 --> 02:07:43,455
飞机坠落在班达海附近
Splashed down in the Banda Sea.

1802
02:07:44,622 --> 02:07:46,124
可能就是那架
Could be the Quinjet.

1803
02:07:46,499 --> 02:07:49,919
但是有斯塔克的隐形科技 我们仍然没法找到那飞机
But with Stark's stealth tech, we still can't track the damn thing.

1804
02:07:51,421 --> 02:07:52,839
是呀
Right.

1805
02:07:53,214 --> 02:07:55,467
也许他游到斐济去了
Probably jumped out and swam to Fiji.

1806
02:07:56,760 --> 02:07:58,678
他会寄明信片回来的
He'll send a postcard.

1807
02:07:58,928 --> 02:08:00,680
"希望你在身边"
"Wish you were here."

1808
02:08:02,599 --> 02:08:05,810
当初你派我去招募他
You sent me to recruit him way back when.

1809
02:08:07,687 --> 02:08:10,273
你知道会发生什么吗?
Did you know then what was gonna happen?

1810
02:08:12,442 --> 02:08:14,444
不知道
You never know.

1811
02:08:14,611 --> 02:08:18,114
知天命 尽人事
You hope for the best, then make do with what you get.

1812
02:08:18,573 --> 02:08:19,991
至少我有个好团队
I got a great team.

1813
02:08:21,159 --> 02:08:23,161
没有东西能永存
Nothing lasts forever.

1814
02:08:23,453 --> 02:08:25,538
而麻烦 罗曼诺夫小姐
Trouble, Ms. Romanoff.

1815
02:08:25,705 --> 02:08:29,042
不管输赢 麻烦总是会来
No matter who wins or loses, trouble still comes around.

1816
02:08:32,962 --> 02:08:34,214
规矩变了
The rules have changed.

1817
02:08:34,339 --> 02:08:35,924
这次来的新家伙和以前不一样
We're dealing with something new.

1818
02:08:36,049 --> 02:08:37,467
幻视是人工智能
The Vision is artificial intelligence.

1819
02:08:37,509 --> 02:08:39,511
- 一台机器  - 那它能举起锤子不算数?
- A machine.  - So, it doesn't count?

1820
02:08:39,594 --> 02:08:41,388
不算数 能举起锤子的人才算数
No, it's not like a person lifting the hammer.

1821
02:08:41,680 --> 02:08:43,431
是的 对我们的规矩就不一样
Right, different rules for us.

1822
02:08:43,473 --> 02:08:44,516
- 是个好人 虽然是人造的  - 谢谢捧场
- Nice guy. Artificial.  - Thank you.

1823
02:08:44,641 --> 02:08:47,602
他有力量拿得起锤子 说明他可以保护心灵之石
He can wield the hammer, he can keep the Mind Stone.

1824
02:08:48,603 --> 02:08:50,772
幻视拿着是很安全的
It's safe with the Vision.

1825
02:08:50,939 --> 02:08:53,483
这个年代 安全已然是一种奢望
And these days, safe is in short supply.

1826
02:08:55,485 --> 02:08:57,487
但如果把锤子放进电梯里...
But if you put the hammer in an elevator...

1827
02:08:57,612 --> 02:08:59,364
- 它还是会随着上升  - 电梯没资格拿锤子
- It would still go up.  - Elevator's not worthy.

1828
02:08:59,489 --> 02:09:01,366
我会想念和你们聊天扯淡的日子的
I'm gonna miss these little talks of ours.

1829
02:09:01,449 --> 02:09:03,118
如果你不走就不会
Not if you don't leave.

1830
02:09:03,159 --> 02:09:05,036
我没得选择
I have no choice.

1831
02:09:05,161 --> 02:09:07,372
心灵之石是近几年出现的
The Mind Stone is the fourth of the Infinity Stones

1832
02:09:07,497 --> 02:09:08,873
第四颗无限宝石
to show up in the last few years.

1833
02:09:08,998 --> 02:09:10,625
这并不是巧合
It's not a coincidence.

1834
02:09:11,376 --> 02:09:13,211
有人在下一盘很大的棋
Someone has been playing an intricate game

1835
02:09:13,294 --> 02:09:15,005
而且还利用了我们
and has made pawns of us.

1836
02:09:15,046 --> 02:09:16,923
如果这一切如那人所策划般进展的话...
And once all these pieces are in position...

1837
02:09:17,048 --> 02:09:18,550
麻将胡了
Triple Yahtzee.

1838
02:09:18,675 --> 02:09:20,135
你觉得你能找出谁在捣鬼吗?
You think you can find out what's coming?

1839
02:09:20,260 --> 02:09:21,344
我可以
I do.

1840
02:09:22,095 --> 02:09:23,680
除非是他
Besides this one,

1841
02:09:23,763 --> 02:09:26,099
除了这个铁男 什么都可以解释
there's nothing that can't be explained.

1842
02:09:33,440 --> 02:09:35,984
他真是不爱惜草坪
That man has no regard for lawn maintenance.

1843
02:09:39,112 --> 02:09:41,823
- 但我会想念他的  - 你也会想念我的
- I'm gonna miss him, though.  - And you're gonna miss me.

1844
02:09:41,865 --> 02:09:43,616
我预感会看到男子汉的眼泪
There's gonna be a lot of manful tears.

1845
02:09:45,618 --> 02:09:47,370
我会想你的 托尼
I will miss you, Tony.

1846
02:09:47,537 --> 02:09:48,538
是吗?
Yeah?

1847
02:09:48,663 --> 02:09:51,249
我也是时候隐退了
Well, it's time for me to tap out.

1848
02:09:51,332 --> 02:09:53,585
或许我会向巴顿学习学习
Maybe I should take a page out of Barton's book.

1849
02:09:53,668 --> 02:09:56,671
为佩珀建一个农场 希望不会被炸烂
Build Pepper a farm, hope nobody blows it up.

1850
02:09:57,297 --> 02:09:58,548
简单的生活
The simple life.

1851
02:09:58,715 --> 02:10:00,050
你将来会有的
You'll get there one day.

1852
02:10:00,091 --> 02:10:01,092
我不清楚
I don't know.

1853
02:10:01,343 --> 02:10:03,803
找个伴儿 稳定下来...
Family, stability...

1854
02:10:04,888 --> 02:10:08,099
渴望这一切的那个人 在75年前被冰封了
The guy who wanted all that went in the ice 75 years ago.

1855
02:10:09,517 --> 02:10:11,394
解冻出来后 想法也变了
I think someone else came out.

1856
02:10:15,440 --> 02:10:16,441
你还好吗?
You all right?

1857
02:10:19,110 --> 02:10:20,570
这就是我的家
I'm home.

1858
02:10:28,453 --> 02:10:31,247
你想一直盯着墙看 还是准备好开始工作了?
You wanna keep staring at the wall, or do you wanna go to work?

1859
02:10:31,414 --> 02:10:32,791
我是说 这堵墙还挺耐看的
I mean, it's a pretty interesting wall.

1860
02:10:32,874 --> 02:10:35,960
我以为你和托尼还要缠绵很久呢
I thought you and Tony were still gazing into each other's eyes.

1861
02:10:36,044 --> 02:10:37,045
情况如何?
How do we look?

1862
02:10:37,253 --> 02:10:39,589
虽然不算最佳阵容
Well, we're not the '27 Yankees.

1863
02:10:39,673 --> 02:10:41,466
但还是有不少好手的
We got some hitters.

1864
02:10:41,549 --> 02:10:44,052
身手不错 但还不算一个团队
They're good. They're not a team.

1865
02:10:44,094 --> 02:10:45,720
那让我们来好好整合一下吧
Let's beat them into shape.

1866
02:11:04,197 --> 02:11:05,824
复仇者们...
Avengers...

1867
02:11:08,000 --> 02:11:12,000
后有彩蛋 请勿走开
