00:00:48,206 --> 00:00:50,361
抱歉 我该轻点的 那还有点疼
I'm sorry, I know it's a little tender.

7
00:00:57,648 --> 00:01:00,992
好 现在你来试着说几句
Okay. Let's try your voice now.

00:01:01,506 --> 00:01:05,806
我叫凯妮丝·艾佛丁  我家在12区
My name is Katniss Everdeen, I'm from District 12.

9
00:01:09,246 --> 00:01:10,969
我..
My...

10
00:01:10,994 --> 00:01:12,605
没事的 慢慢来
Okay, take your time.

11
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:15,675
你的声带还有些肿胀
You got a lot of swelling in your vocal chords.

12
00:01:15,872 --> 00:01:18,998
我
My...

13
00:01:19,641 --> 00:01:21,320
叫
name...

14

凯妮丝
Katniss

16
00:01:25,494 --> 00:01:27,682
艾佛丁
Everdeen.

17
00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:33,302
我想..
I want...

18
00:01:34,282 --> 00:01:36,874
我想跟他谈谈
I want to talk to him.

19
00:01:38,325 --> 00:01:40,205
他还需要时间休息
He needs time.

20
00:01:40,913 --> 00:01:42,705
但是..
But...

21
00:01:42,790 --> 00:01:45,076
今天让他见个新面孔
We're trying something new today.

22
00:01:45,389 --> 00:01:48,164
见到那些医生时他情绪没什么变化 但你知道
He's been calmer with the doctors, but...

23
00:01:48,189 --> 00:01:50,801
这些医生是他的陌生人 所以
They are strangers to him, so...

24
00:01:50,826 --> 00:01:54,132
专家让他见几个家乡的熟人 来测试他的反应
They're going to test his responses，someone he remembers from home.

25
00:01:55,773 --> 00:01:57,564
他会见到一个你信赖的人
Someone you trust.

26
00:02:10,102 --> 00:02:11,607
让她进去
Send her in.

27
00:02:22,721 --> 00:02:23,879
嗨
Hey.

28
00:02:24,248 --> 00:02:25,538
嗨
Hey.

29
00:02:26,382 --> 00:02:28,496
-身体好些了吗 -她走的太近了
- How're you doing? - She's too close.

30
00:02:29,288 --> 00:02:30,611
没事的
It's okay.

31
00:02:30,963 --> 00:02:32,742
我们现在在13区
We're in District 13 now.

32
00:02:32,767 --> 00:02:36,083
13区是真实存在的 那些传言是真的
It's a real place. The stories are true.

33
00:02:38,298 --> 00:02:40,849
我的家人没来看我
My family hasn't come to see me.

34
00:02:44,792 --> 00:02:47,228
12区遭到了轰炸
There's an attack on 12.

35
00:02:49,715 --> 00:02:51,370
我的家人..
My family.

36
00:02:53,402 --> 00:02:55,652
他们没能幸存下来
They didn't survive.

37
00:03:11,707 --> 00:03:13,539
因为凯妮丝
Because of Katniss.

38
00:03:15,061 --> 00:03:17,453
-就是因为她 -那不是她的错
- It's because of Katniss. - It wasn't because of Katniss.

39
00:03:17,478 --> 00:03:19,794
-她告诉你这么说的 -她什么都没告诉我
- She tell you to say that. - She didn't tell me anything.

40
00:03:19,819 --> 00:03:21,429
普瑞姆 她是个骗子
She's a liar, Prim.

41
00:03:21,454 --> 00:03:23,087
我说的是事实
It's the truth.

42
00:03:23,369 --> 00:03:24,415
不
Yeah.

43
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:27,097
你所说的是假的
What you're saying isn't real.

44
00:03:30,339 --> 00:03:32,547
她派你进来找我的
She sent you here to talk to me.

45
00:03:32,681 --> 00:03:34,248
-她知道你现在在这 -没事的
- She knows you're here now. - It's okay.

46
00:03:34,273 --> 00:03:36,400
她全都知道 你不能相信她！
She knows. You can't trust her!

47
00:03:36,425 --> 00:03:38,234
她是个怪物 是个混蛋
She's a monster! She's a mutt!

48
00:03:38,266 --> 00:03:40,303
她是都城派来摧毁我们的
The Capitol bring her to destroy us!

49
00:03:40,328 --> 00:03:41,371
把她带出来
Get her out of there.

50
00:03:41,396 --> 00:03:42,771
你明白我说的话吗！
Do you understand me!

51
00:03:42,796 --> 00:03:44,632
普瑞姆 你一定要杀了她
You have to kill her, Prim!

52
00:03:44,657 --> 00:03:46,808
你一定要.. 杀了她
You have... to kill her!

53
00:03:47,253 --> 00:03:49,323
-凯妮丝 -她是个混蛋！
- Katniss. - She's a mutt!

54
00:03:49,968 --> 00:03:53,304
-他只是受了药物的影响 -杀了她！
- This is just the condition responds. - Kill her!

55
00:03:53,329 --> 00:03:55,845
-那不是真正的他 -她是个怪物 是个混蛋！
- It's not him. - She's a monster! She's a mutt!

56
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:59,061
-不 那不是他 -她是个混蛋！
- No, it's not him. - She's a mutt!

57
00:04:11,547 --> 00:04:13,440
请进
Please, come in.

58
00:04:14,802 --> 00:04:16,208
能不能稍等一下
Will you excuse us?

59
00:04:16,233 --> 00:04:18,281
-一会儿就好 -当然
- For just a moment. - Of course.

60
00:04:19,887 --> 00:04:21,503
请坐
Have a seat.

61
00:04:24,942 --> 00:04:27,206
很高兴你身体有所好转
I'm glad you're feeling better.

62
00:04:33,348 --> 00:04:36,051
斯诺要为他所犯下的罪行付出代价
Snow has to pay for what he's done.

63
00:04:36,076 --> 00:04:37,943
我愿意全力跟你们合作
I want to help the rebels in any way I can.

64
00:04:37,968 --> 00:04:39,493
看到皮塔那样真是难过
It's hard to see Peeta this way.

65
00:04:39,518 --> 00:04:41,294
那不是他
That's not Peeta.

66
00:04:42,962 --> 00:04:45,376
送我去都城区 我会尽我所能
Send me to the Capitol. I'll do anything.

67
00:04:45,401 --> 00:04:46,817
对此我无能为力
I can't.

68
00:04:52,257 --> 00:04:54,446
我不能把你送到那
I can't send you there.

69
00:04:54,929 --> 00:04:57,921
在我们控制2区前我没法把你送到那
We can't get into the Capitol until we control District 2.

70
00:04:57,946 --> 00:04:59,948
那就送我去2区
Then send me to 2.

71
00:05:00,369 --> 00:05:02,420
你需要我鼓舞士气
You want me to fire up our troops.

72
00:05:02,445 --> 00:05:05,511
振奋军心 我到那边看看我能做些什么
Call out to the loyalists, I'll see what I can do.

73
00:05:07,081 --> 00:05:08,865
是的 你在那会很有用的
Yes, that'll help.

74
00:05:49,506 --> 00:05:51,392
在我走之前
I saw Peeta

75
00:05:51,646 --> 00:05:52,821
我去看望了皮塔
before we left.

76
00:05:52,846 --> 00:05:54,891
有何想法？
What'd you think?

77
00:05:55,854 --> 00:05:57,775
感到自己很自私
Something selfish.

78
00:06:00,485 --> 00:06:03,335
因为你再也不用嫉妒他了吗
That you don't have to be jealous of him anymore?

79
00:06:04,735 --> 00:06:06,029
不
No.

80
00:06:08,952 --> 00:06:11,813
在他好转之前我肯定毫无机会
I don't stand a chance if he doesn't get better.

81
00:06:13,770 --> 00:06:15,869
你肯定还是对他念念不忘
You'll never let him go.

82
00:06:37,158 --> 00:06:39,314
你在想什么呢
What's going on in your head?

83
00:06:41,612 --> 00:06:43,341
我不知道
I don't know.

84
00:06:43,366 --> 00:06:45,885
这就像你与一个醉汉接吻
It's like kissing someone who's drunk.

85
00:06:46,761 --> 00:06:48,552
那根本不是真正的吻
It doesn't count.

86
00:06:59,292 --> 00:07:00,999
准备降落
Prepare for landing.

87
00:07:04,396 --> 00:07:05,576
将它包上
Wrap it up.

88
00:07:05,601 --> 00:07:07,774
最后一次机会 行动！
Last chance. Go.

89
00:07:08,185 --> 00:07:10,898
这个装置就像一个捕鸟夹
This is another bird and food trapping resource.

90
00:07:10,923 --> 00:07:12,568
这部分装置使人致盲
This one is designed to blind,

91
00:07:12,593 --> 00:07:14,255
烟雾遮住眼睛
the smoke clings to the eyes.

92
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:16,585
和你抓蜂鸟一个道理
That's an application for Hummingbird trap.

93
00:07:16,610 --> 00:07:18,828
人们感到恐惧，开始跑向
You scared the people, so they flee in this direction

94
00:07:18,853 --> 00:07:21,070
一个他们认为安全的方向
to what they think is a safe haven.

95
00:07:21,095 --> 00:07:22,472
这时引爆炸药
Two tier explosion.

96
00:07:22,497 --> 00:07:25,050
再过会，会有人冲上来帮助伤员
We'll have people enough time to rush in and help the wounded.

97
00:07:25,078 --> 00:07:27,079
这时再次引爆
A second bomb.

98
00:07:27,297 --> 00:07:28,497
没错
Right.

99
00:07:28,916 --> 00:07:30,147
第二枚炸弹安放在这
Second one goes off here.

100
00:07:30,172 --> 00:07:31,454
我想在战场上 为了杀掉另一个人
I guess there are no rules anymore

101
00:07:31,479 --> 00:07:34,271
你们真是不择手段啊
about what a person can do to another person.

102
00:07:35,522 --> 00:07:38,900
我觉得他们劫走皮塔时 可没有手下留情吧
I don't think some of them use any rule book when we hijacked Peeta.

103
00:07:59,519 --> 00:08:00,976
欢迎来到2区
Welcome to District 2.

104
00:08:01,001 --> 00:08:04,236
我是赫姆斯下士 请跟我来
I'm Corporal Homes. If you'll follow me, please.

105
00:08:11,934 --> 00:08:13,022
不用担心
Don't worry.

106
00:08:13,047 --> 00:08:15,311
政府军就是这么对我们说早安的
That's how the loyals say good morning.

107
00:08:15,336 --> 00:08:18,203
科因总统，感谢您派来的增援部队
President Coin, we're indebted to you for the reinforcements

108
00:08:18,228 --> 00:08:20,090
同时感谢嘲笑鸟对我们的帮助
and the Mockingjay.

109
00:08:20,116 --> 00:08:24,036
但我们不确定2区以外的人是不是知道我们起义的消息
But I'm not sure that anyone outside of 2 knows what we've been up against.

110
00:08:24,061 --> 00:08:25,575
这个是“坚果”的立体图
This is the Nut.

111
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:29,137
它是都城的设在2区的总部 也是我们行动的目标
The Capitol's headquarters for our offensive operations.

112
00:08:29,162 --> 00:08:33,674
驻扎在里面的不仅有政府军 还有部分二区的平民
It's manned by both military and civilian personnel from District 2.

113
00:08:33,699 --> 00:08:36,940
从地图上看 整个堡垒建在岩层深处
As you can see, the fortress lies so far beneath the bedrock,

114
00:08:36,965 --> 00:08:38,285
易守难攻
it's untouchable.

115
00:08:38,310 --> 00:08:41,220
昨天我们试图突破东北门
Yesterday, we attempted to take the northeastern gate.

116
00:08:41,251 --> 00:08:45,295
接着遭到空中的进攻 不得不撤退
Then we encountered from higher up and we're forced to pull back.

117
00:08:45,805 --> 00:08:47,085
损失惨重
We took heavy loses.

118
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:49,917
能不能策划一次佯攻 比如派部队聚集在其中一个门附近
Could we create a decoy? Send troops towards one of the gates

119
00:08:49,942 --> 00:08:51,869
然后猛攻另一个
and just send an attack on another.

120
00:08:51,893 --> 00:08:54,175
那么 指挥官你要把哪支部队当做诱饵派上前线呢
Well, who's troops do you propose as a decoy, Commander.

121
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:57,693
我们有嘲笑鸟 别低估了她的作用
We have the Mockingjay, don't underestimate her.

122
00:08:57,718 --> 00:09:00,125
我们可以用她瓦解敌人内部
We could use her to erode support.

123
00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:02,465
她也许能让某些政府军动摇
She maybe be able to sway some of the loyalists.

124
00:09:02,490 --> 00:09:06,023
科因女士 你在地下工事里待了很长一段时间了
You've been underground a long time, Madam Coin.

125
00:09:06,048 --> 00:09:08,320
这里和帕纳姆其它地方不一样
This isn't like the rest of Panem

126
00:09:08,345 --> 00:09:10,313
在这，支持都城的大有人在
Support for the Capitol runs deep here.

127
00:09:10,338 --> 00:09:13,545
那么这里确实是一块难啃的硬骨头
Then there's no sacrifice is too great.

128
00:09:13,964 --> 00:09:17,795
我们需要占领堡垒内部的武器库
We need to control the arsenal inside that fortress.

129
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:21,885
即使我们全军出动 也显得人手不足
Even with every District and it's alliance, we're outgunned.

130
00:09:21,910 --> 00:09:25,012
要是仅仅为了抢武器，我不会派我的地面部队进攻的
I won't commit my people to a ground assault,  just to pillage weapons.

131
00:09:25,037 --> 00:09:26,577
佩勒指挥官 我知道你的人民
Commander Paylor. Your people,

132
00:09:26,602 --> 00:09:29,317
和其他仍然在都城控制下的人一样，饱经苦难
have suffered more than just as anyone else in the hands of the Capitol.

133
00:09:29,342 --> 00:09:31,011
这也是为什么我拒绝派我的部队继续进攻 那简直就是自杀
Which is why I won't condone a mass suicide.

134
00:09:31,036 --> 00:09:33,905
如果我们不拿下2区，我们就无法进攻都城
If we don't take District 2, we won't get in to the Capitol.

135
00:09:33,930 --> 00:09:36,588
我们能够使堡垒瘫痪
We'll be enough to disable the fortress,

136
00:09:36,613 --> 00:09:38,533
因而不需要拿下它
instead of taking it.

137
00:09:38,558 --> 00:09:40,744
你有什么计划
What do you have in mind?

138
00:09:41,595 --> 00:09:43,414
我将它比作一个狼窝
We think of it like a wolf den.

139
00:09:43,439 --> 00:09:46,166
我们没办法直接闯进去 现在我们有两个选择
You're not going to fight your way in, so you got two choices.

140
00:09:46,191 --> 00:09:49,079
要么你把狼困在里面 要么你把它们逼出来
You trap the wolves inside or you flush them out.

141
00:09:49,224 --> 00:09:50,560
我们没法直接攻进去
We can't attack straight on.

142
00:09:50,585 --> 00:09:52,648
我们能不能派飞机对周围的山区进行轰炸
Couldn't we use a hovercraft to strike around it?

143
00:09:52,673 --> 00:09:54,510
我们利用地形 我们知道山峰的弱点在哪
We use the mountains, we have weak spots and peaks.

144
00:09:54,535 --> 00:09:57,425
利用一些地震方面的数据 我们设计一个炸弹
We could design the bomb to target
some sequence season seismic data.

145
00:09:57,450 --> 00:09:58,661
来引发山体滑坡
Trigger avalanches.

146
00:09:58,686 --> 00:10:00,615
堵住所有的出口 切断他们的供应
Block all exits,cut off their supplies.

147
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:03,373
让他们的飞机无法起飞和降落
You make it impossible for them to launch their hovercrafts.

148
00:10:03,398 --> 00:10:05,061
活埋他们
Bury them alive.

149
00:10:05,086 --> 00:10:07,311
我们放弃对他们武器库的进攻计划
We forfeit any chance to control the weapons.

150
00:10:07,336 --> 00:10:09,240
没错 我们这么做大大削弱都城的力量
Yes, but we'd place a weaken in Capitol.

151
00:10:09,265 --> 00:10:11,092
但那里面还有平民
There're civilians in there.

152
00:10:11,352 --> 00:10:13,793
我们应该留个投降的机会给他们
They should be given a chance to surrender.

153
00:10:13,818 --> 00:10:16,025
保留一个补给隧道 以便他们的人撤出
Use one of the supply tunnels for the evacuees

154
00:10:16,052 --> 00:10:18,952
这比12区的遭遇要好太多了
That's a luxury we weren't given when they fire-bombed 12.

155
00:10:18,977 --> 00:10:20,691
肯定有更好的解决方法的
There's got to be a better way.

156
00:10:20,716 --> 00:10:25,175
我提议我们制造山崩封住出口 但保留火车隧道畅通
I suggest we try the avalanche but leave the train tunnel alone.

157
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,912
平民可以跑到广场上
Civilians can escape into the square

158
00:10:26,937 --> 00:10:28,983
我们的部队可以在那接受他们的投降
where our armies will be waiting for their surrender.

159
00:10:29,008 --> 00:10:31,634
让所有的医疗人员在那边待命
We should have every available medic standing by.

160
00:10:31,659 --> 00:10:33,588
如果他们不投降呢
And if they won't surrender?

161
00:10:33,613 --> 00:10:38,545
那么我们需要一个有说服力的人来劝降
Then we will need a compelling voice to persuade them.

162
00:11:07,234 --> 00:11:09,150
凯妮丝 把敌人活埋或者用你的箭将敌人的飞机击落
What's the difference, Katniss.

163
00:11:09,175 --> 00:11:12,288
这有什么区别呢
Crushing the enemy alive or blown them out of the sky with one of Beetee's arrows,

164
00:11:12,313 --> 00:11:13,916
完全就是一码事
it's the same thing.

165
00:11:13,941 --> 00:11:16,952
我们在8区被空袭了
We were under attack in District 8.

166
00:11:17,227 --> 00:11:19,330
而且我们击落的飞机里没有平民
And that hovercraft wasn't filled with civilians.

167
00:11:19,355 --> 00:11:20,830
那有什么关系呢
It doesn't matter.

168
00:11:20,855 --> 00:11:24,586
哪怕那些平民只是拖拖地板，也是在帮敌人啊
You feel civilians are just mopping floors,they're helping the enemy.

169
00:11:25,381 --> 00:11:28,148
我觉得干掉他们没什么问题
If they have to die,I can live with that.

170
00:11:28,703 --> 00:11:30,544
支持都城的没一个好东西
No one who supports the Capitol is innocent.

171
00:11:30,569 --> 00:11:32,890
你这种滥杀无辜的思想也好不到哪去
What about the kind of thinking you can kill whoever you want.

172
00:11:32,915 --> 00:11:36,678
为了保持各区的秩序 你就把孩子送到饥饿游戏的赛场中去
You can send kids off to the Hunger games to keep the Districts in line.

173
00:11:41,686 --> 00:11:43,814
凯妮丝 这是战争
It's war, Katniss.

174
00:11:44,594 --> 00:11:46,906
有时杀戮不是出于个人恩怨
Sometimes killing isn't personal.

175
00:11:47,996 --> 00:11:49,479
而且谁又会知道是我们做的呢？只是你自己太偏执罢了
Figure if anyone who knew that
it was you.

176
00:11:49,504 --> 00:11:53,774
大家都明白 战争总是和个人私欲紧密相连
I, of all people
know that it's always personal.

177
00:12:27,759 --> 00:12:29,659
凯妮丝 不用担心
Don't worry, Katniss.

178
00:12:29,847 --> 00:12:31,626
会有幸存者的
There will be survivors.

179
00:12:31,651 --> 00:12:34,004
现在想想你待会要说些什么
Let's focus on what it is you got to say.

180
00:12:34,029 --> 00:12:36,863
-普鲁塔克已经拟好了演讲稿 -我不会念那份稿子的
- Now, Plutarch wrote a speech...
- I'm not saying that.

181
00:12:36,888 --> 00:12:40,321
-嗯，我也觉得你不会，只是..
-Okay, I didn't think so.
-Just...

182
00:12:40,346 --> 00:12:42,655
我只是提醒你 你的演讲会被直播
Just remember you're talking to everybody.

183
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:47,181
起义军、都城的人、幸存者和投降的人
And not just the rebels,
but the Capitol and the survivors into

184
00:12:47,206 --> 00:12:49,482
都会看到你的演讲
well, to lay down their arms.

185
00:12:49,507 --> 00:12:53,886
所以你的演讲要有足够的煽动性
So, you might want to experiment with
a little sensitivity when you warn them.

186
00:12:53,938 --> 00:12:56,215
演讲简练些 要让他们大吃一惊
Make it quick, the explosion.

187
00:13:20,335 --> 00:13:22,446
我是凯妮丝 艾佛丁
This is Katniss Everdeen,

188
00:13:22,471 --> 00:13:25,404
我在2区的腹地向这些仍然忠于都城的人们发表讲话
speaking to all of the loyalist
from the heart of District 2.

189
00:13:25,429 --> 00:13:26,604
幸存者的乘坐的火车来了！
Survivors.
Inbound!

190
00:13:26,629 --> 00:13:29,072
准备好！
Ready!
Ready!

191
00:13:31,090 --> 00:13:33,216
所有人就位 架起枪
Arms at ready, guns up!

192
00:13:34,112 --> 00:13:35,870
我们需要保护你撤下去
We got to get you back.

193
00:13:36,071 --> 00:13:37,764
他们来了！
Here they come!

194
00:13:42,327 --> 00:13:44,670
所有人靠后站！
Everybody, stand back!

195
00:13:46,049 --> 00:13:47,992
冲上去！
Everybody, go!

196
00:13:48,205 --> 00:13:50,028
-趴在地上！ -把他们赶下车来！
- On the ground!
- Get them off the train!

197
00:13:50,053 --> 00:13:52,395
放下武器
Put your weapons down.

198
00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:53,714
趴在地上！
Get on the ground!

199
00:13:53,739 --> 00:13:56,182
放下你们的武器，马上！
Put your weapons down, now!

200
00:13:56,207 --> 00:13:58,481
放下武器!
Weapons down.

201
00:13:59,198 --> 00:14:01,666
你，放下武器！
You, put it down.

202
00:14:01,691 --> 00:14:04,710
放下..放下武器！
Put it...
Put your weapons down!

203
00:14:04,735 --> 00:14:06,470
放下武器！
Drop your weapon!

204
00:14:06,495 --> 00:14:08,281
你，放下武器！
You, drop it!

205
00:14:08,805 --> 00:14:10,553
放下武器！
Drop the gun!

206
00:14:10,578 --> 00:14:11,933
放下武器！
Drop it!

207
00:14:12,181 --> 00:14:13,856
-别开枪！ -都别开枪！
- Hold your fire.
- Stop!

208
00:14:13,881 --> 00:14:15,242
别开枪！
Stop!

209
00:14:15,442 --> 00:14:17,153
-别开枪！ -都别开枪！
- Hold your fire!
- Stop!

210
00:14:17,178 --> 00:14:18,273
-别开枪！
Hold your fire!

211
00:14:18,298 --> 00:14:20,652
-他需要治疗！ -别开枪！
- He needs help!
- Hold your fire!

212
00:14:22,074 --> 00:14:23,596
放下武器
Drop it.

213
00:14:25,318 --> 00:14:27,665
给我一个不开枪杀你的理由
Give me one reason
I shouldn't shoot you.

214
00:14:27,690 --> 00:14:29,428
放下武器！
Drop the gun!

215
00:14:38,198 --> 00:14:39,676
我不能
I can't.

216
00:14:42,127 --> 00:14:44,799
我觉得这就是问题所在
I guess that's the problem, isn't it?

217
00:14:46,989 --> 00:14:49,127
我们炸了你们的矿井
We blew up your mine.

218
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:52,562
你们把我们的家乡夷为平地
You burned my district to the ground.

219
00:14:53,447 --> 00:14:56,590
我们每个人都有相互残杀的理由
We each have every reason
to want to kill each other.

220
00:14:58,176 --> 00:15:00,640
如果你杀了我
So, if you want to kill me too.

221
00:15:01,358 --> 00:15:03,430
某个人会很开心
Make someone happy.

222
00:15:03,753 --> 00:15:07,771
我已经厌倦和斯诺的棋子互相杀戮了
I'm tired
of killing slaves for him.

223
00:15:08,429 --> 00:15:10,865
我可不是他的棋子
I'm not a slave.

224
00:15:11,227 --> 00:15:12,719
我是
I am.

225
00:15:13,554 --> 00:15:15,905
那就是为什么我杀了加图
That's why I killed Cato...

226
00:15:16,634 --> 00:15:18,769
他杀了斯莱士
and he killed Thresh...

227
00:15:18,981 --> 00:15:21,312
斯莱士杀了克拉芙
and Thresh killed Clove.

228
00:15:21,955 --> 00:15:27,128
总是这样不停的循环下去，最后你猜谁赢了
It just goes around and around,
and who wins?

229
00:15:27,526 --> 00:15:30,005
当然 赢家总是斯诺
Always Snow.

230
00:15:30,251 --> 00:15:34,936
我已经厌倦了成为他游戏里的棋子了
I'm done being
a piece in his Game.

231
00:15:35,419 --> 00:15:39,023
12区 2区 我们本来能和平共处
District 12, District 2
we have no fight.

232
00:15:39,586 --> 00:15:42,051
战争是都城挑起的
Except the one the Capitol gave us.

233
00:15:44,626 --> 00:15:47,147
为什么你要抵抗我们起义军呢
Why are you fighting the rebels?

234
00:15:47,556 --> 00:15:49,292
为什么要与你的邻居兵戎相见呢？
Your neighbors?

235
00:15:50,328 --> 00:15:51,963
为什么要与你的家人手足相残呢？
Your family?

236
00:16:11,819 --> 00:16:16,215
这些人不是你们的敌人
These people are not your enemy!

237
00:16:17,045 --> 00:16:19,712
我们只有一个敌人
We all have only one enemy.

238
00:16:19,954 --> 00:16:21,992
那就是斯诺
And that's Snow.

239
00:16:23,293 --> 00:16:27,011
他让我们每个人堕落腐化
He corrupts everyone and everything.

240
00:16:28,296 --> 00:16:31,436
让我们这些本该和睦相处的人相互残杀
He turns the best of us
against each other.

241
00:16:32,666 --> 00:16:35,589
别再为他卖命了
Stop killing for him!

242
00:16:37,243 --> 00:16:42,581
今晚 我们把枪口对准都城
Tonight, turn your weapons
to the Capitol.

243
00:16:44,126 --> 00:16:47,761
对准斯诺
Turn you weapons
to Snow.

244
00:16:49,405 --> 00:16:55,035
今晚 把你的枪口对准都城
Tonight, turn your weapons
to the Capitol.

245
00:16:55,695 --> 00:16:59,311
对准斯诺
Turn you weapons
to Snow.

246
00:17:02,125 --> 00:17:03,792
别开枪！
Hold you fire!

247
00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:10,872
干杯！
A toast.

248
00:17:15,696 --> 00:17:17,454
安东尼奥斯
Antonius.

249
00:17:17,775 --> 00:17:20,240
我们最精锐的部队已经阵亡在那座山里了
With our best troops
crushed in the mountains

250
00:17:20,265 --> 00:17:23,487
就在我们谈话的时候 敌人还在向我们进军
and the rebels marching
on us as we speak.

251
00:17:23,858 --> 00:17:26,036
所以我想问问 我们到底在庆祝什么
What do we celebrate?

252
00:17:27,207 --> 00:17:29,656
先生 我认为我们在庆祝嘲笑鸟之死
The death of the Mockingjay, Sir.

253
00:17:29,911 --> 00:17:33,385
虽然皮塔没能杀了她 她的自大葬送了自己的性命
If Peeta didn't kill her,
her own arrogance did.

254
00:17:48,702 --> 00:17:50,404
当然
Of course.

255
00:17:50,429 --> 00:17:54,356
同样也是这么一种肤浅的思想 让你做出了
That's the same facile thinking
that led you to divert

256
00:17:54,381 --> 00:17:57,853
把我们最为精锐的部队派进2区这样一个错误的决定
our best peacekeepers into District 2.

257
00:17:58,232 --> 00:18:02,069
你有一个坏习惯 喜欢在一切还未尘埃落定时就盖棺定论
You have the habit of burying people
before they are dead.

258
00:18:02,094 --> 00:18:04,286
如果嘲笑鸟真的死了
If the Mockingjay was gone,

259
00:18:04,311 --> 00:18:08,354
叛军会利用她的烈士形象大肆宣传
the rebels would already
be using her as a martyr.

260
00:18:09,436 --> 00:18:12,010
安东尼奥斯首相，你说的不对
No, Minister Antonius.

261
00:18:12,073 --> 00:18:15,703
我觉得我们不是在庆祝嘲笑鸟之死
I'm afraid that is not what
we were toasting at all.

262
00:18:15,728 --> 00:18:17,130
先生 你说的对
Yes, Sir.

263
00:18:17,444 --> 00:18:20,504
我们的部队能抵抗住叛军..
The rebels can be held off out...

264
00:18:23,632 --> 00:18:26,815
叛军几天后就会抵达
The rebels will reach the
outskirts of the Capitol

265
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:28,917
都城的外围
in a matter of days.

266
00:18:29,459 --> 00:18:32,282
我们把外围街区的军队撤下来
We'll evacuate the outer blocks...

267
00:18:32,912 --> 00:18:34,679
放叛军进来
to let them in.

268
00:18:35,006 --> 00:18:38,425
把所有的防空导弹准备好
I want all anti-aircraft defenses ready,

269
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:41,478
保住制空权
so we're secured from the skies.

270
00:18:41,668 --> 00:18:43,785
放他们进城
Lure them into the city

271
00:18:43,810 --> 00:18:49,906
然后我们布下的陷阱会让他们每前进一步都得付出惨痛的代价
and then our gamemakers will make
them pay for every inch with blood.

272
00:18:50,238 --> 00:18:52,654
让所有的探头监控这一切
I want every camera watching.

273
00:18:53,005 --> 00:18:57,428
我们要让他们的前进变成一种折磨
We will turn their advance
into a celebration of suffering.

274
00:18:58,151 --> 00:19:02,963
还要用摄像机录下他们死亡的过程 让我们的子孙后代有机会欣赏那些场景
Let each moment be captured
for all posterity.

275
00:19:04,963 --> 00:19:06,274
所以..
So...

276
00:19:06,861 --> 00:19:10,730
安东尼奥斯首相 我们到底在庆祝什么呢
What do we toast tonight,
Minister Antonius?

277
00:19:12,719 --> 00:19:15,755
我们在庆祝一个光辉的时代
We toast to the glorious era

278
00:19:17,136 --> 00:19:20,313
终于可悲的结束了
coming to it's bitter end.

279
00:19:27,274 --> 00:19:29,346
哈哈 找到你了
Well, there she is.

280
00:19:29,716 --> 00:19:31,371
嘲笑鸟
The Mockingjay.

281
00:19:32,298 --> 00:19:34,306
噢 看看我身上这些伤疤
Oh, that itch you gave.

282
00:19:34,331 --> 00:19:38,923
天 我对我们打的那一架可是记忆犹新啊 现在回想起来还会浑身起鸡皮疙瘩
Oh, man, the feel. I mean
I still have goose bumps.

283
00:19:40,122 --> 00:19:41,495
你应该不会介意吧
You don't mind, do you?

284
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:43,683
他们没再给我注射吗啡了
They cut off my supply of morphine.

285
00:19:43,708 --> 00:19:46,404
那个主治医生每天都来看我 尝试着
This head doctor that comes in and
sees me everyday, she tried to...

286
00:19:46,429 --> 00:19:49,837
让我平静下来 让我适应这里的生活
help me adjust to reality
like some...

287
00:19:49,862 --> 00:19:54,814
仿佛就像这个兔子窝里真的有人了解我一样
Like some guy from this rabbit warren
actually knows anything about my reality.

288
00:19:59,006 --> 00:20:03,181
每次开会时他都要重申好几遍：你是安全的
At least 20 times in a session
he tells me that I'm totally safe.

289
00:20:04,072 --> 00:20:06,037
你不会受到都城的迫害
Safe from the Capitol.

290
00:20:06,386 --> 00:20:08,193
或是遭受斯诺的暴政
Safe from Snow.

291
00:20:10,957 --> 00:20:13,366
嘲笑鸟 你怎么看 你真的有安全感吗
What about you, Mockingjay?
You feeling totally safe?

292
00:20:13,396 --> 00:20:14,905
在我中弹前 我都没感到安全过
Till I got shot.

293
00:20:14,930 --> 00:20:18,356
天 那子弹根本没碰到你呢
Oh, please.
The bullet didn't even touched you.

294
00:20:18,381 --> 00:20:22,066
这些突发情况高层早就预料到了 你身上的“戏服”当然是防弹的了
Something they thought about.
Of course your costume would be bulletproof.

295
00:20:22,489 --> 00:20:24,373
所以你到底受了什么伤呢
So, what are your injuries?

296
00:20:25,451 --> 00:20:28,181
肋骨和肺部受伤了
Bruised ribs.
Bruised lung.

297
00:20:28,206 --> 00:20:31,012
真奇怪 他们怎么不给你换个新的肺
I'm surprised they haven't
found you a new lung.

298
00:20:31,435 --> 00:20:33,912
我身上有两个肺呢 要不要从我身上拿一个？
Well, I got 2,
do you want one of mine?

299
00:20:35,216 --> 00:20:37,844
我的意思是 每个人都要保护你的生命安全
I mean, it's everybody's job
to keep you alive.

300
00:20:37,869 --> 00:20:39,636
这就是你讨厌我的原因吗
Is that why you hate me?

301
00:20:39,661 --> 00:20:40,752
那只是部分原因
Partly.

302
00:20:40,777 --> 00:20:43,361
你真的很虚伪
You're also a little
hard to swallow.

303
00:20:43,386 --> 00:20:47,671
你主演的那一幕幕闹剧和你那些帮助弱者的举动都显得那么低劣可笑
The whole tacky romance drama and
the defender-of-the-helpless act.

304
00:20:47,696 --> 00:20:49,534
虽说你帮助弱者时不像是在演戏
Even though it's not an act.

305
00:20:49,559 --> 00:20:52,175
但这一切都让你显得更加令人讨厌
Which makes you even
more unbearable.

306
00:20:52,709 --> 00:20:55,121
能够亲口说出这些真是感到如释重负啊
Feel free to take
any of this personally.

307
00:20:55,146 --> 00:20:58,730
你应该去当嘲笑鸟 你想说什么就说什么
You should have been the Mockingjay,
nobody has to tell you what to say.

308
00:20:58,755 --> 00:21:00,818
但没人看好我
But nobody likes me.

309
00:21:01,946 --> 00:21:03,563
至少你还是自由的
You're free.

310
00:21:04,006 --> 00:21:05,806
在这里是挺自由，但是在别的地方..
Maybe here, but...

311
00:21:06,689 --> 00:21:09,719
都城里的人们只因为你而感到恐惧
In the Capitol, you're the
only thing they're scared of.

312
00:21:14,968 --> 00:21:17,617
那只是些我家人带来的小玩意儿
It's just stuff my family brought.

313
00:21:28,796 --> 00:21:30,445
这是皮塔带来的？
This from Peeta?

314
00:21:31,603 --> 00:21:32,931
没错
Yep.

315
00:21:39,205 --> 00:21:41,991
都城的那帮人真是让我们不得安宁啊
They messed us up
pretty good, didn't they?

316
00:21:44,179 --> 00:21:46,551
我们给他看了些你在2区演讲的镜头
We showed him footage of your
speech in 2.

317
00:21:46,576 --> 00:21:48,249
他脑子里还是有对你的真实记忆的
He had real memories of you.

318
00:21:48,274 --> 00:21:50,301
这不代表我可以去看他了啊
That still doesn't mean
I am going in there.

319
00:21:50,326 --> 00:21:52,148
他已经被捆住了 不会伤害你的
He's strapped down.
He can't hurt you.

320
00:21:52,173 --> 00:21:53,499
不 我不是那个意思
No, This is different.

321
00:21:53,524 --> 00:21:54,771
海米奇 我真的不想见他
Haymitch, I really
don't want to.

322
00:21:54,796 --> 00:21:56,575
这不是你想不想的问题
Well, it doesn't matter what you want.

323
00:21:56,600 --> 00:22:01,159
这都是为了皮塔好 试试没坏处的
It's for Peeta.
What's the harm in trying.

324
00:22:19,612 --> 00:22:21,534
我还以为你死了
I watched you die.

325
00:22:23,933 --> 00:22:26,443
- 你看起来真糟糕 - 你看起来好多了
- You look terrible.
- You looked better.

326
00:22:26,468 --> 00:22:28,596
你说这话时一点也不真诚
You're not remotely nice
to say that to me now.

327
00:22:28,621 --> 00:22:31,556
我从来就不是个真诚的人 你才是
I was never the nice one,
you were.

328
00:22:33,849 --> 00:22:35,895
当我看你倒下去的时候
When I saw you die,

329
00:22:36,767 --> 00:22:38,807
我想起了一些事
I remembered something.

330
00:22:39,159 --> 00:22:40,866
想起了那些面包
About the bread.

331
00:22:41,306 --> 00:22:45,527
我想起那是个雨天
I remember,
you in the rain.

332
00:22:47,109 --> 00:22:49,445
我故意把面包烤焦
And I burned it on purpose,

333
00:22:50,635 --> 00:22:52,391
为了送面包给你吃
to give it to you.

334
00:22:54,956 --> 00:22:58,426
我记得我妈妈还揍了我
I remember,
my mother hitting me.

335
00:22:59,286 --> 00:23:00,853
因为我没把那些焦面包扔给猪
I was supposed to
give it to the pig.

336
00:23:00,878 --> 00:23:03,391
在那之前我好几天没吃东西了
That was the first
I've eaten in days.

337
00:23:04,288 --> 00:23:06,488
我怎么可能为了你去受那样一顿毒打
How I take a beating
like that for you?

338
00:23:06,513 --> 00:23:08,558
因为你很善良
Because you are kind...

339
00:23:08,976 --> 00:23:10,893
很大方
and generous.

340
00:23:12,399 --> 00:23:16,036
- 人们都说你喜欢我 -有人说我喜欢你？
- And people said you loved me.
- Did people say you loved me?

341
00:23:16,428 --> 00:23:18,974
这就是斯诺折磨你的原因
They said that's why
Snow tortured you.

342
00:23:19,772 --> 00:23:20,951
因为他想折磨我
To hurt me.

343
00:23:20,976 --> 00:23:23,639
斯诺说你所说的一切都是假的
Snow says everything that
comes out of your mouth is a lie.

344
00:23:26,635 --> 00:23:30,748
我所知道的是要是当时我把那些面包扔给猪
All I know is that I would have
saved myself a lot of suffering.

345
00:23:31,212 --> 00:23:33,759
我就可以少受些折磨了
If I had just given
that bread to the pig.

346
00:23:55,416 --> 00:23:59,344
我只想衷心的对你道声谢
I think the only thing left to say
is thank you.

347
00:24:00,562 --> 00:24:02,359
我要去都城
I need to be in the Capitol.

348
00:24:02,384 --> 00:24:04,032
不 你的任务已经完成了
No, you've done your job.

349
00:24:04,057 --> 00:24:08,037
嘲笑鸟 你已经做的很好了 你成功的使所有区团结在一起
You've been very successful as the Mockingjay,
you've unified the Districts.

350
00:24:08,062 --> 00:24:11,171
现在我们希望你好好休息
And now we want you to rest

351
00:24:11,196 --> 00:24:12,630
保养好自己的身体
and to heal.

352
00:24:12,655 --> 00:24:15,087
起义军最后一次看见我的时候 我还躺在地上
The last the rebels saw me,
I was lying on the ground.

353
00:24:15,112 --> 00:24:18,111
凯妮丝 你放心，我不会让我们之前的宣传付诸东流的
Katniss, we won't let this
momentum go to waste.

354
00:24:18,136 --> 00:24:21,037
我们就在13区，就在这里拍一些短片
We will shoot more propos,
right here in 13.

355
00:24:21,062 --> 00:24:22,306
证明你还活着
Showing them that you're alive.

356
00:24:22,331 --> 00:24:25,515
-我应该和部队待在一块 -这和你上前线效果是一样的
- I should be with the troops.
- It will be like being on the front line.

357
00:24:25,540 --> 00:24:29,972
就我们的官兵所知道的 你被一颗子弹击中心脏但却幸存下来
As far as the soldiers know,
you survived a bullet to the heart.

358
00:24:29,997 --> 00:24:32,741
我觉得他们能明白为什么你没能和他们并肩作战
I think they will understand
why you're not with them.

359
00:24:32,766 --> 00:24:36,930
我们赢得这场战争之后 就用飞机送你过去 接受他们的投降
When we win this war,
we'll fly you in for the surrender.

360
00:24:36,955 --> 00:24:41,225
受降典礼需要你出席 你对我们来说至关重要
We'll need you for the ceremony.
You are very valuable to us.

361
00:24:44,754 --> 00:24:47,586
你要我做什么都没问题
I'll do whatever
you need me to do.

362
00:24:47,836 --> 00:24:49,604
从今往后
From this day forward,

363
00:24:49,629 --> 00:24:52,722
无论是生老病死
in sickness and in health,

364
00:24:53,059 --> 00:24:55,781
还是富贵贫穷
for richer or poorer,

365
00:24:55,806 --> 00:25:00,832
我都会好好的爱你 珍惜你
I promise to love and
cherish you each day.

366
00:25:01,846 --> 00:25:04,163
我 芬尼克 奥戴尔
I, Finnick Odair.

367
00:25:04,599 --> 00:25:09,631
与安妮 克莱斯塔结为夫妻
Take you, Annie Cresta as
my wife from this day forward,

368
00:25:09,656 --> 00:25:14,431
一生一世
together or apart,
we will always be united.

369
00:25:14,456 --> 00:25:16,070
永不分离
One life.

370
00:25:16,195 --> 00:25:17,730
志同道合
One purpose.

371
00:25:17,755 --> 00:25:19,572
长相厮守
One destiny.

372
00:25:19,826 --> 00:25:21,874
现在你可以亲吻新娘了
You may kiss the bride.

373
00:25:59,761 --> 00:26:02,008
你去看望了皮塔吧
You saw Peeta, didn't you?

374
00:26:02,769 --> 00:26:04,667
有没有替我向他问好
Would you tell him hi for me?

375
00:26:04,692 --> 00:26:06,681
你知道他可是我的老朋友啦
We're old friends, you know.

376
00:26:06,706 --> 00:26:08,656
我们在都城被关在同一间牢房里
We had a joint in the
cells in the Capitol,

377
00:26:08,681 --> 00:26:11,828
对彼此的尖叫声都十分熟悉呢
we're very familiar with
each other's screams.

378
00:26:13,179 --> 00:26:15,486
我要去杀了斯诺
I'm going to kill Snow.

379
00:26:18,086 --> 00:26:21,176
只要他活着一天我们就一天不得安生
Nothing is good or safe
while he's alive.

380
00:26:21,326 --> 00:26:23,952
杀他之前我不想再演讲一番了
And I can't make
another speech about it.

381
00:26:24,696 --> 00:26:26,739
不想再对着镜头
No more cameras.

382
00:26:27,191 --> 00:26:29,412
不想再拍宣传片
No more propos.

383
00:26:29,902 --> 00:26:32,092
不想再演戏了
No more games.

384
00:26:34,532 --> 00:26:37,781
当我杀他的时候 我要他看着我的眼睛
He needs to see my eyes
when I kill him.

385
00:26:43,316 --> 00:26:45,224
嘲笑鸟终于开始有主见啦
Now you're talking.

386
00:26:48,249 --> 00:26:51,634
我在想有没有别的法子去都城
Find a way to the Capitol when
everyone is looking the other way.

387
00:26:52,155 --> 00:26:54,778
我刚刚听到有几个医务人员在聊天 他们今天半夜要把物资
I heard the medics talking, they're
shipping supplies to the front line

388
00:26:54,803 --> 00:26:57,543
送到前线去
from Hanger 2
around midnight, tonight.

389
00:26:58,053 --> 00:27:02,998
我本打算从中偷点止痛药之类的药品 但我想了想
Medicines, painkillers I was going to steal
something in mess hall but I guess I could...

390
00:27:03,596 --> 00:27:06,597
我可以留在这为你作掩护
just stay here
and cover for you.

391
00:27:08,192 --> 00:27:11,409
凯妮丝 即使他是总统 你也能杀了他
Anybody can kill anybody, Katniss,
even the president.

392
00:27:12,106 --> 00:27:15,383
只要你愿意牺牲自己
You just have to be
willing to sacrifice yourself.

393
00:27:24,072 --> 00:27:26,388
走之前上去跳支舞吧
Don't you want Snow
to see you dance?

394
00:30:11,286 --> 00:30:12,769
那不是嘲笑鸟吗
It's her.

395
00:30:49,285 --> 00:30:50,534
嗨
Hey.

396
00:30:50,626 --> 00:30:53,412
-我以为你还在医院里呢 -之前是呆在那
- I thought you were in the hospital.
- I was.

397
00:30:54,548 --> 00:30:55,826
来吧
Come on.

398
00:30:56,036 --> 00:30:57,791
她去那里干什么？
What is she doing?

399
00:30:58,432 --> 00:31:00,968
那真是令人沮丧啊 她自己跑出去了
Well, it's so frustrating
that she goes rogue.

400
00:31:00,993 --> 00:31:04,527
她竟然敢违抗我的命令
This isn't just about a lesson,
it's insubordination.

401
00:31:05,026 --> 00:31:06,526
让第一架回来的飞机把她送回来
Bring her on the
first hovercraft back.

402
00:31:06,551 --> 00:31:09,698
说什么呢 现在不能让她回来
Don't be ridiculous,
she can't come back now.

403
00:31:10,348 --> 00:31:12,050
她现在就是个传奇
She's an epic.

404
00:31:13,677 --> 00:31:16,984
在前线受了枪伤 却活了下来
In the front line,
surviving a gun shot wound...

405
00:31:17,556 --> 00:31:20,092
我都写不出一个比这更好的剧本了
I couldn't stage it better myself.

406
00:31:21,259 --> 00:31:22,729
是啊
No.

407
00:31:23,642 --> 00:31:27,377
让她待在前线吧
She's going to stay
where she is.

408
00:31:29,445 --> 00:31:33,857
她所做的一切
And whatever she's doing,
we conceived it.

409
00:31:34,176 --> 00:31:36,556
都是在我们的计划掌控之中的
It was our plan all along.

410
00:31:37,779 --> 00:31:39,440
当然
Of course it was.

411
00:31:40,206 --> 00:31:41,983
海文斯比先生
Mr. Heavensbee.

412
00:31:42,615 --> 00:31:44,589
你是制订规则的人
You are the gamemaker.

413
00:31:44,986 --> 00:31:48,154
我要让所有人知道无论她采取什么行动
I want everyone to know
whatever game she's playing.

414
00:31:48,179 --> 00:31:50,288
她都是在为我们卖命
She's playing for us.

415
00:32:00,402 --> 00:32:03,041
我是第八区的指挥官佩勒
I'm commander Paylor of District 8.

416
00:32:03,066 --> 00:32:05,739
我和你们一样 都是在前线浴血奋战的士兵
I'm a soldier like
all of you, so...

417
00:32:05,764 --> 00:32:07,209
我想说的是
Here's what I know.

418
00:32:07,234 --> 00:32:12,083
这是我们一生中第一次看到13个区的人们在一起并肩作战
For the first time in our lifetimes,
we're standing together with 13 districts.

419
00:32:12,346 --> 00:32:15,881
我认为我们已经创造了历史
From what I see here,
we already made history.

420
00:32:20,708 --> 00:32:22,838
但我们不应该就此满足
But history didn't stop to celebrate.

421
00:32:22,863 --> 00:32:26,494
我们正面对一个顽固不化 拒绝投降的敌人
And we are facing an enemy that will
not change and will never surrender.

422
00:32:26,519 --> 00:32:30,895
斯诺总统将部队撤下 加强了城中心的守卫
President Snow has pulled back peacemakers
to fortify the center of the city.

423
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:33,517
他正从都城外围撤离居民
He's evacuating residents
from the outer blocks.

424
00:32:33,542 --> 00:32:36,084
平民们感到恐慌绝望
The civilians will be
confused and desperate.

425
00:32:36,109 --> 00:32:39,388
我命令你们不能伤害平民
You are under orders
not to target them.

426
00:32:39,525 --> 00:32:42,376
我们会部署医疗兵来帮助这些需要帮助的人
We are deploying medical brigades
to help anyone in need.

427
00:32:42,401 --> 00:32:45,300
我们要向都城人民证明我们是善良的
We'll show the Capitol people
who we are.

428
00:32:45,588 --> 00:32:49,951
为了迟缓我们的进攻 斯诺总统在城内布下了许多地雷
To slow our advance, President Snow
is building a minefield of traps.

429
00:32:49,976 --> 00:32:52,721
和一些被称作“豆荚”的杀人装置
And lethal devices called "Pods".

430
00:32:52,746 --> 00:32:57,301
敌人发明这些残忍陷阱的目的是杀死我们的士兵 并从中取乐
The sadistic inventions the gamemakers
meant to make sport of our deaths.

431
00:32:57,326 --> 00:33:00,235
如果我们的部队能闯过城中的陷阱和守卫关卡
If our armies make it past
peacekeepers and other defenses,

432
00:33:00,260 --> 00:33:02,624
我们将包围斯诺的宅邸
we'll converge in the center
of the city at Snow's mansion

433
00:33:02,649 --> 00:33:04,488
到时我们将不仅仅是轰开他的大门
Where we won't just
unlock his gates,

434
00:33:04,513 --> 00:33:06,671
还解放了整个帕纳姆
but unshackle all of Panem.

435
00:33:06,696 --> 00:33:09,514
（欢呼声）
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

436
00:33:11,625 --> 00:33:13,184
如果我们不幸阵亡
If we die...

437
00:33:13,208 --> 00:33:16,163
希望我们死的值得
Let it be for a cause
and not a spectacle.

438
00:33:16,188 --> 00:33:21,024
如果我们活下来了 愿上天保佑我们帕纳姆！
If we succeed, let it be for all
of Panem and let it be forever.

439
00:33:21,378 --> 00:33:24,214
是的 你们已经创造了历史
Yes, you already made history.

440
00:33:24,822 --> 00:33:26,578
历史
But the future...

441
00:33:26,753 --> 00:33:29,915
将在明天拂晓我们的总攻中
Our future starts tomorrow at dawn.

442
00:33:29,940 --> 00:33:33,159
掀开新的篇章
When we march together
into the Capitol.

443
00:33:50,206 --> 00:33:52,138
你将加入451小队？
Squad 451?

444
00:33:58,312 --> 00:34:00,708
看起来你已经准备好你的食物了
Looks like you got
your meals covered.

445
00:34:00,816 --> 00:34:04,214
-我希望在走之前准备周全 -别瞒着我了
- I'm trying to be prepared.
- Don't lie to me.

446
00:34:04,239 --> 00:34:06,823
我们这辈子都在一起打猎
We've been hunting
together all our lives.

447
00:34:07,056 --> 00:34:09,555
我知道你这次想离开小队单独行动
I know when you're going
to go off on your own.

448
00:34:14,262 --> 00:34:15,922
你这次还打算把我扔下吗?
You're going to
leave me behind too?

449
00:34:15,947 --> 00:34:18,153
作为你的部下
As you fellow soldier,

450
00:34:18,966 --> 00:34:21,833
我建议你还是和你的分队待在一起吧
I suggest that
you stay with your unit.

451
00:34:22,806 --> 00:34:25,867
如果你一定要来，我也没法阻止你
I couldn't stop you
if you wanted to come.

452
00:34:25,892 --> 00:34:28,561
霍桑 艾佛丁
Hawthorne.
Everdeen.

453
00:34:28,969 --> 00:34:31,071
来见见大家
Come meet your new unit.

454
00:34:37,156 --> 00:34:39,001
我是杰克逊中尉
I'm Lieutenant Jackson.

455
00:34:39,026 --> 00:34:41,462
现在我向你介绍一下与你同行的小队成员
And I want to introduce
you to your squad.

456
00:34:41,656 --> 00:34:45,900
这是米歇尔少尉 帕纳姆的神枪手
This is the second lieutenant Mitchell.
The best sharp shooter in Panem.

457
00:34:45,925 --> 00:34:49,011
这两位 列格姐妹 来自第一战斗师
These are the Leeg sisters,
First Combat Division.

458
00:34:49,036 --> 00:34:52,166
这位是霍姆斯下士
And this is Corporal Homes.

459
00:34:53,865 --> 00:34:55,385
芬尼克？
Finnick?

460
00:34:56,702 --> 00:34:58,889
-你和我们一起去吗？ -没错
- Are you with us?
- Looks like it.

461
00:34:58,914 --> 00:35:00,581
蜜月期真短啊
That's a short honeymoon.

462
00:35:00,606 --> 00:35:02,479
是啊
Yeah.
Well...

463
00:35:02,809 --> 00:35:05,807
我想在我们拿下都城后
I guess we got to have one
in the Capitol.

464
00:35:05,832 --> 00:35:08,324
-我们会在那再度一次蜜月 -集合
- After we take it.
- Gather around.

465
00:35:13,359 --> 00:35:15,416
451中队
Squadron 451.

466
00:35:15,441 --> 00:35:17,347
我是你们的总指挥
You’re my unit.

467
00:35:17,372 --> 00:35:20,135
杰克逊中尉是副指挥
Lieutenant Jackson is my second in command.

468
00:35:20,496 --> 00:35:23,211
你们中的每一个人都是战场上的精英
Each one of you is elite
in some form of combat.

469
00:35:23,236 --> 00:35:25,296
但我们不是战斗部队
But we are a non-combat unit,

470
00:35:25,321 --> 00:35:27,962
所以我们将跟在前线部队后面
so, we'll be following days behind
the front line troops.

471
00:35:27,987 --> 00:35:31,521
作为明星小队
You are to be the onscreen
faces of the invasion.

472
00:35:31,546 --> 00:35:33,481
你们的行动将被直播
The Star squad.

473
00:35:33,506 --> 00:35:36,496
指挥部认为直播你们的行动能鼓舞军心
It's been decided that you are most
effective when seen by the masses.

474
00:35:36,521 --> 00:35:37,763
所以 我们将不参与任何战斗？
So, we're not going to fight?

475
00:35:37,788 --> 00:35:39,184
士兵 我命令你做什么你就做什么
You do whatever you
are ordered to do, soldier.

476
00:35:39,209 --> 00:35:41,435
现在轮不到你提问
It's not your job
to ask question.

477
00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:42,801
是的 先生
Yes, sir.

478
00:35:43,004 --> 00:35:45,322
我们接到的指示是在进军都城时
Our instructions are to shoot
propaganda footage

479
00:35:45,347 --> 00:35:47,591
拍摄宣传镜头
on the battle scars
troop to the Capitol.

480
00:35:47,616 --> 00:35:49,986
你们每个人都是被精心挑选出来 去震慑敌人
You are handpicked to
intimidate their forces.

481
00:35:50,011 --> 00:35:52,007
劝诫他们投降
And inspire surrenders.

482
00:35:52,032 --> 00:35:55,132
即使我们大多数时间都在离前线数英里的地方拍摄
Even though we'll be working on abandon
streets miles behind the front line,

483
00:35:55,157 --> 00:35:58,128
我向你们担保，无论他把我们派到哪里，都不会绝对的安全
I guarantee you, wherever they put us,
it will not be safe.

484
00:35:58,153 --> 00:36:00,076
我们将身处战场
This is a war zone.

485
00:36:00,206 --> 00:36:05,381
我们可能遇到活动的“豆荚”和敌人的部队
It is likely that we'll encounter both
active Pods and peacekeepers.

486
00:36:05,708 --> 00:36:08,151
你们是都城的重点抓捕目标
You're considered high value
targets to the Capitol.

487
00:36:08,176 --> 00:36:11,561
要是不幸落入敌手 用这种"夜锁"药丸自杀
In the event of capture,
you'll be given a nightlock pill.

488
00:36:11,586 --> 00:36:15,272
服用后毒性立马发作 杰克逊中尉请将药丸分发下去
A poison that acts immediately.
Lieutenant Jackson do the honors.

489
00:36:15,416 --> 00:36:17,498
我向你们简要介绍下“豆荚”
I've already briefed
you on the Pods.

490
00:36:17,523 --> 00:36:20,736
仔细听好了 每个街区上都有这种陷阱
I remind you,
they are on every block.

491
00:36:21,535 --> 00:36:23,970
上级给我们小队分配了一个“全息图”装置
Our unit has been given a HOLO.

492
00:36:25,565 --> 00:36:28,656
这是一个数据库 内置都城的详细地图
A database that contain the
detailed map of the Capitol

493
00:36:28,699 --> 00:36:30,579
上面记录了每一个已知“豆荚”的具体位置
and the list of every known Pod.

494
00:36:30,604 --> 00:36:32,037
这些陷阱
These Pods,

495
00:36:32,062 --> 00:36:35,845
能被例如炸弹和一些不幸靠近的倒霉蛋触发
can trigger anything from bombs,
to traps, to mutts.

496
00:36:35,870 --> 00:36:37,890
没有这个装置我们就无法行动
We cannot move without this device.

497
00:36:37,915 --> 00:36:39,995
同时这个数据库可能是不完整的
There's no guarantee that
our database is complete.

498
00:36:40,020 --> 00:36:41,954
也可能有我们尚未注意到的“豆荚”
There can be new Pods
that we are not aware of.

499
00:36:41,979 --> 00:36:45,056
我们不想让敌人知道我们有这么清楚的情报
Because we don't want the gamemakers
to know we have this Intel.

500
00:36:45,081 --> 00:36:47,985
因此装置内部有一个自毁装置 你启动这个开关
There's a self-destruct on it
You flip this switch.

501
00:36:48,010 --> 00:36:52,168
说三声"夜锁",它就会自爆，爆炸半径10英吋
You say, "nightlock" 3 times it's going to blow
itself and anything within a 10 foot radius.

502
00:36:52,193 --> 00:36:54,971
不要擅自行动
Stay within our unit.

503
00:36:54,996 --> 00:36:59,117
即便我们有这个装置 敌人也可能布下新的"豆荚"
Even with the HOLO, it's likely
that new Pods have been set.

504
00:36:59,142 --> 00:37:03,192
不管那里面是什么 那肯定能要了你的命
Whatever they contain,
they are meant to kill you.

505
00:37:04,436 --> 00:37:06,241
先生们女士们
Ladies and gentlemen.

506
00:37:06,266 --> 00:37:09,609
欢迎来到第76届饥饿游戏
Welcome to the 76th Hunger Games.

507
00:37:36,516 --> 00:37:38,666
我从未见过这里空无一人
I've never seen this place so empty.

508
00:37:38,691 --> 00:37:40,812
大家留心观察周围情况
Just keep your eyes open.

509
00:38:02,241 --> 00:38:04,077
这附近有个陷阱
We got a Pod..

510
00:38:04,202 --> 00:38:05,908
快找隐蔽物
Stay cover.

511
00:38:12,006 --> 00:38:14,556
从这两栋楼中间射一箭
Shoot through those 2 buildings.

512
00:38:16,836 --> 00:38:18,324
陷阱
Pod.

513
00:38:19,446 --> 00:38:22,850
就在那 克雷西达
Right here.
Cressida.

514
00:38:26,879 --> 00:38:28,244
位置不错
Good.

515
00:38:33,552 --> 00:38:35,592
凯妮丝 准备好了就射击
When you're ready, Katniss.

516
00:38:41,342 --> 00:38:44,452
停
Hold it.
Pod is tighter.

517
00:38:45,365 --> 00:38:46,867
开弓吧
Okay.

518
00:39:16,992 --> 00:39:18,760
警报解除
All clear.

519
00:39:20,465 --> 00:39:22,905
我觉得我们走不过这片雷区的
I don't think we can
get across this minefield.

520
00:39:23,932 --> 00:39:25,962
没有“全息图”就没法过雷区
Not without that HOLO.

521
00:39:26,146 --> 00:39:28,697
指挥官醒着时我们没法拿走那个装置
We're not getting to get it
off him while he's awake

522
00:39:28,722 --> 00:39:31,226
记得校正我们俩的手表 今晚统一行动
Make sure we're on the
same watch tonight.

523
00:39:36,876 --> 00:39:38,827
那是政府军的卡车吗
Is that peacemakers?

524
00:39:44,226 --> 00:39:48,487
451小队呼叫基地 一辆卡车从南面驶向我们的驻地，完毕
451 to Base. We got a truck
coming in from the south, over.

525
00:39:49,836 --> 00:39:51,881
小队明白，完毕
Copy that, over.

526
00:39:51,906 --> 00:39:54,774
不必紧张 那是自己人
Stand down everyone, it's friendly.

527
00:40:35,579 --> 00:40:37,568
我来自12区
I'm with District 12.

528
00:40:40,484 --> 00:40:42,464
我来自12区
I'm with District 12.

529
00:40:42,489 --> 00:40:43,869
停下！
Okay, stop.

530
00:40:43,894 --> 00:40:47,161
住手 大家都冷静
Hold up.
Everyone relax.

531
00:40:47,186 --> 00:40:48,855
我们拿他怎么办
What are we doing?

532
00:40:49,856 --> 00:40:51,838
杰克逊 铐上他
Jackson, cuff him.

533
00:40:59,619 --> 00:41:04,386
士兵 这只是保险措施 弄清楚情况后我们会给你解开的
Soldier, this is just a precaution, until we
have everything straighten out, yeah.

534
00:41:07,341 --> 00:41:09,224
我来自12区
I'm District 12.

535
00:41:11,905 --> 00:41:13,574
上级希望我们将他拍进宣传片
They want us to
add him to the propo.

536
00:41:13,599 --> 00:41:15,807
以证明他现在已经站到我们这边了
To show he's on our side now.

537
00:41:16,533 --> 00:41:19,561
我们往前走几个街区 再给他拍一个短片
We'll move forward a few blocks
tomorrow and shoot him a footage.

538
00:41:19,586 --> 00:41:21,158
他甚至都不能控制住自己
He's not in control of himself.

539
00:41:21,183 --> 00:41:24,152
现在我安排一个值班表 轮流看守他
I say we schedule an around
the clock watch on him.

540
00:41:24,177 --> 00:41:25,783
到17点 由列格姐妹俩负责
The Leegs till 1700.

541
00:41:25,808 --> 00:41:28,204
17点到晚上19点 由赫姆斯和米歇尔负责
Homes and Mitchell till 1900.

542
00:41:28,229 --> 00:41:30,171
把我也安排进值班表
Give me a watch.

543
00:41:31,262 --> 00:41:34,026
到了关键时刻 你确定你能朝他开枪吗
If it ever came down to it,
you think you can shoot him?

544
00:41:34,058 --> 00:41:38,321
那时我不是朝皮塔开枪 而是朝一个都城来的杂种开枪
I wouldn't be shooting Peeta.
I'd be killing a Capitol mutt.

545
00:41:38,346 --> 00:41:42,485
你这样说更让我不放心了
I'm not sure that kind of comment
recommends you for the job either, soldier.

546
00:41:42,834 --> 00:41:44,842
把她排进值班表
Put her in the rotation.

547
00:42:06,906 --> 00:42:08,949
他肯定会试图杀了我
He's going to try to kill me.

548
00:42:09,123 --> 00:42:12,047
尤其是当我们行动的时候 我肯定会激怒他
Especially with all this going on.
It's going to set him off.

549
00:42:12,276 --> 00:42:14,468
我们会牢牢看住他的
We'll keep him contained.

550
00:42:14,629 --> 00:42:16,740
为什么科因这么做
Why would Coin do this?

551
00:42:20,789 --> 00:42:22,568
我所知道的有限
Here's all I know.

552
00:42:23,556 --> 00:42:26,663
那次在竞技场里她想救出来的是皮塔而不是你
It was Peeta that she wanted
rescued from the arena.

553
00:42:26,688 --> 00:42:28,156
她一点都不喜欢你
She never liked you.

554
00:42:28,181 --> 00:42:31,252
她不喜欢那些她控制不住的人
She doesn't like anybody
or anything she can't control.

555
00:42:31,277 --> 00:42:35,380
-所以她就让我置身于危险的境地? -她说她不是故意为之，但实际上..
- So, she would put my life in danger?
- She denied, but...

556
00:42:35,858 --> 00:42:37,005
怎么了？
What?

557
00:42:37,030 --> 00:42:39,906
总有一天这场战争要结束
One way or another this war
is going to come to an end.

558
00:42:40,342 --> 00:42:42,831
他们承诺将会举行一场自由的选举
They promised a free election.

559
00:42:43,306 --> 00:42:45,949
也许她已经将你视作一个威胁
Maybe she's starting
to see you as a threat.

560
00:42:46,146 --> 00:42:49,081
没人会支持我做领导人的
Nobody would
think that I'd be a leader.

561
00:42:49,106 --> 00:42:52,633
但如果要你支持某位候选人 你会选她吗
But you'll throw support to someone,
would it be her?

562
00:42:55,572 --> 00:42:58,803
如果你不是毫不犹豫的回答道“会” 那么你对她来说就是个威胁
If your immediate answer isn't yes,
then you are dangerous.

563
00:42:59,345 --> 00:43:03,937
她已经不需要你拍摄那些宣传片了 因为这些宣传片没有你一样也能拍下去
She doesn't need you as a rallying cry any more
than these propos can be done without you.

564
00:43:03,962 --> 00:43:07,929
你现在所做的一切只会让起义的势头继续高涨
Only one thing you could do now
to add more fire to this rebellion.

565
00:43:08,327 --> 00:43:09,678
科因想要我一死了之
Die.

566
00:43:09,703 --> 00:43:12,511
凯妮丝 我是不会让这种事情发生的
That's not going to happen
under my watch, Katniss.

567
00:43:14,006 --> 00:43:16,445
我会好好保护你的
I'm planning for you
to have a long life.

568
00:43:16,806 --> 00:43:19,024
为什么？你为什么要这么做？
Why?
You don't owe me anything.

569
00:43:20,419 --> 00:43:22,500
因为你付出了太多 理应享受胜利
Because you've earned it.

570
00:43:33,926 --> 00:43:36,134
你知道吗 我们以前一起到过这儿的
We've been here before, you know?

571
00:43:37,449 --> 00:43:38,830
什么？
What?

572
00:43:39,792 --> 00:43:41,409
你脸上的表情
That look.

573
00:43:42,136 --> 00:43:44,118
你这表情我以前看到过
I've seen that look.

574
00:43:46,905 --> 00:43:50,760
那时你在决定你到底要不要杀了我
You're trying to decide
whether or not you should kill me.

575
00:43:50,785 --> 00:43:52,973
我从来没想过要杀了你
I never wanted to kill you.

576
00:43:54,942 --> 00:43:56,574
我心里想的不是这个
That's not what I'm doing.

577
00:43:56,599 --> 00:43:58,836
我们第一次在饥饿游戏上见面时
I saw with my own eyes.

578
00:43:59,285 --> 00:44:00,511
我亲眼所见
In the first games

579
00:44:00,536 --> 00:44:04,432
那次 我以为你要和卡瑞尔一起杀掉我
In the first games, I thought you were
trying to help the Careers to kill me.

580
00:44:06,032 --> 00:44:08,634
在那之后 我把你
After that, I saw you...

581
00:44:09,356 --> 00:44:11,112
当成我的伙伴
as an ally.

582
00:44:13,566 --> 00:44:15,241
朋友
Friend.

583
00:44:15,486 --> 00:44:17,108
爱人
Lover

584
00:44:17,759 --> 00:44:19,287
胜利者
Victor.

585
00:44:20,152 --> 00:44:21,861
未婚妻
Fiancee.

586
00:44:21,886 --> 00:44:23,086
敌人
Enemy

587
00:44:23,111 --> 00:44:24,382
攻击目标
Target.

588
00:44:24,407 --> 00:44:27,372
杂种 现在又多了个词：“伙伴”
Mutt.
And now ally?

589
00:44:27,445 --> 00:44:31,119
我已经彻底没法分清你到底是谁了
Yeah. I'll add it to the list of words
I use to try to figure you out.

590
00:44:36,099 --> 00:44:37,606
对不起
I'm sorry.

591
00:44:39,329 --> 00:44:44,363
我只是没法分清事实的真假了
I just can't tell what's real
and what's made up anymore.

592
00:44:44,388 --> 00:44:48,213
那就多开口问问大家 安妮也是这么做的
Then ask.
That's what Annie does.

593
00:44:48,255 --> 00:44:49,668
问谁呢
Ask who?

594
00:44:49,693 --> 00:44:52,988
问我们 我们是你的新同伴
Us.
We're your new unit now.

595
00:45:03,176 --> 00:45:05,560
你最喜欢的颜色是绿色
Your favorite color is green.

596
00:45:06,686 --> 00:45:08,271
这个是真的吗
Is that's real?

597
00:45:10,449 --> 00:45:13,227
是的 是绿色
Yeah.
It's green.

598

你最喜欢的颜色是橙色
Yours is orange.

599
00:45:18,230 --> 00:45:21,502
不..应该是亮橙色
Not... bright orange.

600
00:45:22,349 --> 00:45:25,019
像日落一样温暖的亮橙色
Soft like the sunset.

601

谢谢
Thank you.

你喝茶时从不加糖

606
00:45:49,956 --> 00:45:52,645
你系鞋带总是打双结
You always double-knot your shoelaces.

607
00:45:55,306 --> 00:45:56,878
你说得对
You were right.

608
00:45:59,368 --> 00:46:01,087
我不能走
I can't do this.

609
00:46:10,695 --> 00:46:13,144
我觉得我们走不掉了
I guess we're not leaving anymore.

610
00:46:15,212 --> 00:46:17,648
拿不到全息仪我们哪都去不了
We're not going anywhere
without that HOLO.

611
00:46:18,975 --> 00:46:20,413
各位听好了
Listen up.

612
00:46:22,117 --> 00:46:23,931
这个弹夹是空的
The mag's empty.

613
00:46:26,883 --> 00:46:28,876
为了他拍宣传片而准备的
It's for someone for the propo.

614
00:46:33,309 --> 00:46:36,579
我们继续前进 向北走五个街区
Let's move.
We're heading 5 blocks north.

Boggs.

621
00:47:27,486 --> 00:47:29,543
这个拍摄点不错
This is a good spot.

622
00:47:29,972 --> 00:47:33,775

- Through there, in the courtyard.

保护好“全息图”

我已不适合指挥
Unfit for command.

634

移交指挥权

水位上涨的速度降低了
It's slowing down.

664

我们的性命仍然在他们的掌控中
Gamemakers are still running
on the show.

665
00:52:06,493 --> 00:52:09,951

- 451 to Base, over.
- Hey, we better move.

666
00:52:09,976 --> 00:52:12,921
之前政府军不知道我们的方位 现在他们知道了
The peacemakers didn't know
where we were, they do now.

667
00:52:12,946 --> 00:52:15,321
那些监控探头发现了我们
Those surveillance cameras caught us.

668
00:52:15,346 --> 00:52:17,791
451小队呼叫基地 请回答

This is a bad spot.
We need to move, now.

670

451小队呼叫基地 完毕
451 to Base, over.

671
00:52:24,958 --> 00:52:26,705
这没信号
I can't get a signal.

672
00:52:27,446 --> 00:52:30,582
我知道回基地的路线 艾佛丁 把“全息图”给我
But I can get us back to Base.
Everdeen, give me the HOLO

673
00:52:32,626 --> 00:52:35,417
艾佛丁 我重复一遍 快给我 我们要行动了
Everdeen, what'd I just say?
The HOLO, come on, let's go.

674
00:52:35,442 --> 00:52:37,460
博格斯把它给了我
Boggs gave it to me.

675
00:52:38,345 --> 00:52:40,381
-你都在说些什么 -博格斯确实这么做了
- What are you talking about?
- He did.

676
00:52:40,406 --> 00:52:42,677
他将指挥权移交给了她
He transferred security clearance to her.

677
00:52:42,702 --> 00:52:44,169
我亲眼所见
I saw him.

678
00:52:45,906 --> 00:52:47,770
他为什么这么做？
And why did he do that?

679
00:52:48,376 --> 00:52:50,971
科因总统给了我一个特殊任务
I'm on special orders from Coin.

680
00:52:51,226 --> 00:52:52,762
什么任务？
To do what?

681
00:52:52,913 --> 00:52:55,460
暗杀斯诺总统
To assassinate President Snow.

682
00:52:58,473 --> 00:53:01,026
我不信 不用多想就知道你在撒谎
I don't believe that
for one second.

683
00:53:01,596 --> 00:53:03,171
作为小队的新指挥官
As your new unit commander,

684
00:53:03,196 --> 00:53:07,126
我命令你现在就将安全许可移交给我
I order you to transfer
security clearance to me. Now

685
00:53:07,151 --> 00:53:09,005
我不能这么做
I can't do that.

686
00:53:12,806 --> 00:53:15,197
让我们暂且先别窝里斗
Let's not lose our heads here.

687
00:53:19,365 --> 00:53:23,729
我不是在请求你 我命令你 把“全息图”给我
I'm not asking it again, Everdeen.
Give me that HOLO.

688
00:53:25,046 --> 00:53:29,531
她说的是事实 普鲁塔克想要我们把暗杀斯诺总统的过程直播出来
She's telling the truth.
Plutarch wants it televised.

689
00:53:29,556 --> 00:53:32,467
他认为如果我们能拍下那一幕
He thinks if we can film
the Mockingjay assassinating Snow,

690
00:53:32,492 --> 00:53:36,400
都城能更快的投降 避免更大的伤亡
It will make the Capitol surrender
before the casualties get too high.

691
00:53:36,425 --> 00:53:40,185
正当我们争执不休之时 大量政府军正朝这逼近
While we're arguing, there's a hundred
peacekeepers on their way here.

692
00:53:43,342 --> 00:53:46,796
博格斯说过你是和我们一伙的
Boggs promised me that when the
time came you would help me.

693
00:54:03,716 --> 00:54:05,388
好吧 士兵
Alright, soldier.

694
00:54:05,679 --> 00:54:07,604
“全息图”是你的了
The HOLO is yours.

695
00:54:18,766 --> 00:54:21,463
我觉得我们应该不会再被发现了 我们应该马上行动了
I don't think we're going to leave
any footprints. We should move, now.

696
00:54:21,488 --> 00:54:23,778
外面的大部分监控镜头都被油污遮住了
Most cameras outside should be
covered up by the oil.

697
00:54:23,803 --> 00:54:27,448
她的腿伤得太重 不能继续前进了
She can't move forward like this.
Her leg's too bad.

698
00:54:27,473 --> 00:54:29,527
我们需要带她撤离
We have to evacuate her.

699
00:54:30,626 --> 00:54:32,137
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

700
00:54:32,646 --> 00:54:34,862
我会和她待在一起
I'll stay with her.

701
00:54:34,887 --> 00:54:36,536
我承诺我们一与指挥部联系上
As soon as we make contact,

702
00:54:36,561 --> 00:54:39,335
我们就让他们派人来找你们
we will send somebody back.
I promise you.

703
00:54:42,096 --> 00:54:43,296
各位 我们出发
Alright, everybody, move out.

704
00:54:43,321 --> 00:54:45,042
-拉上他一起走 -行动！
- Let's get him up.
- Go.

705
00:54:47,066 --> 00:54:48,696
你能自己走吗？
Can you walk?

Today, as our peacekeepers
valiantly hold off the rebels,

714
00:57:00,749 --> 00:57:04,418
我要告诉大家一个好消息
our story takes a surprising twist.

凯妮丝 艾佛丁 我们曾经的骄傲
Katniss Everdeen.

has infiltrated the city
with some of the Victors.

717
00:57:11,456 --> 00:57:13,748
他们的名字大家都很熟悉了
Who's names are all too familiar.

718
00:57:13,773 --> 00:57:17,481
芬尼克 奥戴尔和皮塔 梅尔拉克
Finnick Odair
and Peeta Mellark.

719
00:57:19,503 --> 00:57:23,538
很明显 没有永恒的盟友
Clearly, some alliances don't last forever.

720
00:57:25,151 --> 00:57:27,701
各位观众看一看几分钟前发生的一幕
Take a look at what happened
just a moment ago.

721
00:57:27,726 --> 00:57:30,875
当我们的部队包围了凯妮丝 艾佛丁
When our peacekeepers
cornered Katniss Everdeen

722
00:57:30,900 --> 00:57:33,801
和她那一队愚蠢的同伙时
and her band of foolish rebels.

723
00:57:33,825 --> 00:57:38,214
无论是怎样一种自大的想法驱使她回到这里
Whatever arrogance brought this
treacherous girl back to us.

724
00:57:38,240 --> 00:57:41,923
你们马上就要目睹我们胜利的一幕 不仅对都城而言
You're about to witness a great
victory, not only to the Capitol,

725
00:57:41,948 --> 00:57:43,920
而是对所有帕纳姆而言
but for Panem.

726
00:58:03,296 --> 00:58:05,022
好的 你们已经看到了

727
00:58:05,426 --> 00:58:08,854
凯妮丝 艾佛丁 燃烧的女孩
Katniss Everdeen, the girl on fire.

728

她曾经引发了一场场暴动

到头来终究惨死

So, now that we are dead,
what are we going to do?

732
00:58:22,546 --> 00:58:24,493
这还不清楚吗？
Isn't it obvious?

733
00:58:25,592 --> 00:58:28,122
下一步你们会干掉我
The next move is to kill me.

734
00:58:32,986 --> 00:58:35,583
我害死了我的同伴
I murdered one of
our squad members.

735
00:58:38,412 --> 00:58:40,399
凯妮丝说的对
Katniss is right.

736
00:58:42,247 --> 00:58:43,965
我就是个杂种
I'm a mutt.

737
00:58:44,606 --> 00:58:48,392
我下一次发作只是时间问题
It's only a matter of time
before I snapped again.

738
00:58:50,152 --> 00:58:52,178
我无法控制自己
I'm not in control.

739
00:58:53,099 --> 00:58:54,798
给我一粒"夜锁"药丸
I need a nightlock pill.

740
00:58:54,823 --> 00:58:56,697
这样我就能自杀了
So, I can die when I need to.

741
00:58:56,722 --> 00:58:59,453
要是到了紧要关头 我会亲手杀了你
When it gets to that point
I'll kill you myself.

742
00:59:17,728 --> 00:59:21,161
我真是难以理解都城的上层都在想些什么
I don't think I ever really
understood the Capitol until now.

So, Katniss Everdeen.

751
00:59:57,707 --> 01:00:03,391
不过只是一个擅长箭术 反覆无常的小丫头
A poor unstable girl was nothing but
a small talent with a bow and arrow,

752
01:00:03,416 --> 01:00:05,094
她已经死了
is dead.

753
01:00:05,832 --> 01:00:08,714
她不聪明 也不配当领袖
Not a thinker.
Not a leader.

754
01:00:08,739 --> 01:00:11,961
不过是一群贱民拉出来册封的勇士罢了
Simply a face
plucked for the masses.

755
01:00:11,986 --> 01:00:17,365
她有用么 对于你们这伙人的革命当然有用
Was she valuable?
She was extremely valuable to your rebellion.

756
01:00:17,390 --> 01:00:21,967
因为你们毫无眼光 无法推选出一位优秀的领袖
Because you have no vision,
no true leader among you.

757
01:00:21,992 --> 01:00:25,081
你们将自己称作起义军
You call themselves an alliance,

758
01:00:25,106 --> 01:00:27,481
但我认为你们只不过是一群乌合之众罢了
but we saw what that means.

759
01:00:27,506 --> 01:00:31,500
你们部队内斗不断 士兵之间斗的你死我活
Your soldiers are at
each other's throats.

760
01:00:34,246 --> 01:00:37,451
你们趁早安息去吧 帕纳姆人

那我就自我介绍一下
please allow me to introduce myself.

763
01:00:41,256 --> 01:00:44,031
我是总统科因
I am President Alma Coin,

764
01:00:44,056 --> 01:00:46,131
起义军的领袖
leader of the rebellion.

765
01:00:46,156 --> 01:00:48,701
我之所以打断你们总统的广播
I interrupted a broadcast
from your president

766
01:00:48,726 --> 01:00:52,901
是因为他正试图抹黑一位年轻、勇敢的姑娘
in which he attempted to defame
a brave young woman.

767
01:00:52,926 --> 01:00:57,084
一群贱民拉出来册封的勇士  他是这么称呼她的
A face, picked for the masses,
he called her.

768
01:00:57,109 --> 01:00:59,841
册封  她可用不着
- Plucked.
- As if a leader...

769
01:00:59,866 --> 01:01:04,181
一位真正的领导  不用任何人册封

a small town girl from
the scene in District 12,

772
01:01:10,146 --> 01:01:13,861
她撑过了饥饿游戏和世纪争霸赛
who survived the Hunger Games
and the Quarter Quell.

773
01:01:13,886 --> 01:01:19,953
她把一群奴隶变成一支具有强大战斗力的军队
And rose up and turn a nation
of slaves into an army.

774
01:01:20,656 --> 01:01:25,541
不管她是死是活 凯妮丝永远是我们革命中不可替代的角色
Dead or alive. Katniss Everdeen
will remain the face of this revolution.

775
01:01:26,126 --> 01:01:28,021
就算她死了  她也绝不是白死
She will not have
died for nothing.

776
01:01:28,046 --> 01:01:30,446
我从来都没想到她把我看这么重
I have no idea
I meant so much to her.

777
01:01:30,471 --> 01:01:34,221
我们会替她完成她的遗愿 同时也是我们的目标 解放帕纳姆
Her vision and ours
will be realised.

778
01:01:34,246 --> 01:01:36,403
我们要建设一个自由的新帕纳姆国
A free Panem.

779
01:01:36,428 --> 01:01:38,851
我们要民主
With self-determination for all.

780
01:01:38,876 --> 01:01:43,991
我们会消灭一切妄图迫害帕纳姆人民
And in her memory, we will all
find strength to rid Panem

781
01:01:44,016 --> 01:01:46,077
的压迫者
of it's oppressors

782
01:01:47,272 --> 01:01:49,105
保卫我们的国家
and be safe.

783
01:01:50,399 --> 01:01:52,554
永远铭记嘲笑鸟
REMEMBER THE MOCKINGJAY

784
01:01:52,579 --> 01:01:55,774
斯诺在他的宅邸里  他的宅邸在哪？
- Snow is in his mansion.
- Where is that?

785
01:02:01,369 --> 01:02:03,011
我们在这儿
That's us.

786
01:02:03,396 --> 01:02:05,511
这是市中心
That's the city circle.

787
01:02:05,536 --> 01:02:09,314
隔着大约70到75个街道
It's at least
70, 75 blocks north.

788
01:02:09,636 --> 01:02:12,351
-75个？ -是的
- 75 blocks?
- Uh huh.

789
01:02:12,376 --> 01:02:15,091
没人知道我们还活着  我们能好好利用这个有利条件
Nobody knows we're alive.
This is our chance.

790
01:02:15,116 --> 01:02:18,075
这几栋楼  从那里看得见斯诺的花园么
These buildings, do these
look over Snow's garden?

791
01:02:18,100 --> 01:02:19,791
我  可以的
- I...
- They do.

792
01:02:19,816 --> 01:02:21,807
只要他走出来  我就能一箭射死他
If he goes outside at all,
I can get a clear shot.

793
01:02:21,832 --> 01:02:23,715
先别想那么远
We are getting ahead
of ourselves here.

794
01:02:23,740 --> 01:02:26,334
不管他们还在不在找我们  我们被困在这儿了
Whether they're looking for us
or not, we're pinned down.

795
01:02:26,359 --> 01:02:29,360
按那个按钮  把所有的"豆荚"搜出来
Hit that button,
scan for Pods.

796
01:02:31,443 --> 01:02:33,024
走十步路就能撞见一个
Just about every 10 steps.

797
01:02:33,049 --> 01:02:35,771
而且新布下的陷阱的这儿还没显示
Yeah, that doesn't even
show the new ones.

798
01:02:35,796 --> 01:02:37,772
所以到了街上我们将寸步难行
So, we can't go anywhere
in the streets.

799
01:02:37,797 --> 01:02:40,274
这红点还真是密集啊
And the red tops suggest to that.

800
01:02:43,576 --> 01:02:45,506
我们也许能找到别的路
There might be another way.

801
01:02:50,983 --> 01:02:53,814
我的兄弟对这些通道了如指掌
My brother knows these
tunnels really well.

802
01:02:54,784 --> 01:02:57,381
他原来在这儿的地下排污系统工作
He works sanitation down here.

803
01:02:57,585 --> 01:02:59,946
后来他们割掉了他的舌头 真庆幸还留了他一条小命
I'm glad they made him an Avox.

804
01:03:09,649 --> 01:03:11,850
嘿 波乐克斯
Hey. Hey.

805
01:03:11,875 --> 01:03:14,719
你还好吗？
You're going to be okay?
看着我
Look at me.

806
01:03:14,744 --> 01:03:16,301
看着我
Look at me.

807
01:03:16,636 --> 01:03:20,810
我们一定能安全穿过这里的
We're going to get through this,
我保证
I promise.

808
01:03:35,350 --> 01:03:38,312
我们花了5年时间才把他赎出来
It take us 5 years to
buy his way out of here.

809
01:03:38,337 --> 01:03:40,716
他才得以重见天日
He didn't see the sun once.

810
01:04:20,596 --> 01:04:22,594
我们在这很容易被发现
We're too expose here.

811
01:04:46,452 --> 01:04:49,945
先生
Sir.
需要为您叫医生过来吗？
Shall I call you a doctor?

812
01:04:51,666 --> 01:04:55,096
你说什么？
- What did you say?
需要为您叫医生过来吗？
- Shall I call your a doctor?

813
01:04:55,869 --> 01:04:59,115
我以为你叫醒我是因为有比一个老年人的健康状况
I hope you waking me for
something more urgent than

814
01:04:59,140 --> 01:05:00,662
更为紧急的事
an old man's health.

815
01:05:00,687 --> 01:05:04,095
他们没死
They survived.
不知道怎么回事
I don't know how.

816
01:05:04,120 --> 01:05:06,021
我们在监控里发现了他们的踪迹
We picked them up
on a surveillance cam.

817
01:05:06,046 --> 01:05:09,944
让我看看
Let me see.
我..我需要亲自确认
I-I need to see for myself.

818
01:05:12,956 --> 01:05:17,350
是她
It's her.
确实是她
It is her.

819
01:05:20,692 --> 01:05:24,087
原来他们把战场转移到了地下
Her arena has moved underground.

820
01:05:44,256 --> 01:05:45,911
看起来安全
Looks clear.

821
01:06:10,219 --> 01:06:12,080
大家都没事吧？
Everybody, okay?

822
01:06:14,246 --> 01:06:15,764
没事
Yeah.

823
01:06:41,446 --> 01:06:43,545
好了 大家在这里先停会
Alright, everybody.
Let's stop here for a bit

824
01:06:43,570 --> 01:06:45,336
休息一下
and get some rest, yeah?

825
01:06:47,805 --> 01:06:50,005
我放第一班哨
I'll take first watch.

826
01:06:54,626 --> 01:06:57,636
皮塔
Hey, Peeta,

827
01:07:03,612 --> 01:07:05,716
好了，大家都坐下休息吧
Alright, settle in, everybody.

828
01:07:26,599 --> 01:07:29,792
凯妮丝 轮到你放哨了
Katniss, your watch.

829
01:07:54,292 --> 01:07:59,519
你应该知道 他们在我身上下了毒药
You know, the capital, they used
tracker jacker venom on me.

830
01:08:00,186 --> 01:08:05,752
13区的医生告诉我的
That's what the doctors on 13 said.
你也被叮过
You were stung once too.

831
01:08:07,119 --> 01:08:09,008
我说的是真的吗？
Real or not real?

832
01:08:10,530 --> 01:08:11,962
是
Real.

833
01:08:12,366 --> 01:08:17,996
他们对我下毒后
When they used the venom on me,
会给我看我以前的照片
they would show me pictures of my life.

834
01:08:19,646 --> 01:08:25,050
但是有些不是真实的
But some weren't real.
是他们篡改过了的
They changed them.

835
01:08:28,656 --> 01:08:32,802
一开始我分不清哪些是真实的
At first, they all-they all blend together, but now...

836
01:08:33,306 --> 01:08:36,071
现在我能分辨出一些了
now I can sort them out a little.

837
01:08:36,096 --> 01:08:40,262
像是...被他们改过的一小部分，
Like the... little ones that they changed,
有一些...
they have this...

838
01:08:40,287 --> 01:08:42,677
有一些重声，就像是
this choir,
it's like they're

839
01:08:43,096 --> 01:08:46,293
他们闪着光，
They are shiny,
是被修饰过了的
they've been glossed over.

840
01:08:48,966 --> 01:08:50,796
你该好好休息下
You should get some rest.

841
01:08:52,919 --> 01:08:57,938
你仍在努力保护我，我说的对吗？
You're still trying to protect me, real or not real?

842
01:08:57,963 --> 01:08:59,342
对
Real.

843
01:09:00,839 --> 01:09:02,832
我们都会这么做
That's what you and I do.

844
01:09:04,056 --> 01:09:06,056
让对方活着
Keep each other alive.

845
01:10:25,325 --> 01:10:26,913
凯妮丝
Katniss.

846
01:10:34,153 --> 01:10:35,463

What is that?

我们该走了
We got to go.
我们必须马上离开这里
We got to get out of here now.

848
01:10:37,173 --> 01:10:38,819
那是蜥蜴人 他们放出了蜥蜴人
Mutts.
They release mutts.

849
01:10:38,844 --> 01:10:40,329
波力克斯，最快出去的路在哪儿？

我们知道  我们早就知道这些了
We know.
We all knew.

909
01:21:32,396 --> 01:21:35,126
那些来自十三区的士兵们..
- Soldiers from 13 didn't...
- Do you...

910
01:21:35,335 --> 01:21:39,341
你真以为杰克逊相信你身负科因的命令吗
Do you really believe that Jackson
thought you had orders from Coin?

911
01:21:40,746 --> 01:21:44,110
她只信任博格斯  所以她想让你接着完成他的使命
She trusted Boggs, so he
clearly wanted you to go on.

912
01:21:46,959 --> 01:21:49,586
我没想到事情会成这样
I never meant for this to happen.

913
01:21:51,308 --> 01:21:53,201
我辜负了他们
I failed them.

914
01:21:55,939 --> 01:22:00,041
是我害死了他们  我害死了了芬尼克
I killed-I killed them.
I killed Finnick.

915
01:22:00,766 --> 01:22:03,053
我很抱歉  波乐克斯
I'm sorry, Pollux.

916
01:22:04,629 --> 01:22:06,387
真的很对不起他们
So sorry.

917
01:22:06,628 --> 01:22:08,214
葛利姆
Glimmer.

918
01:22:08,311 --> 01:22:10,168

芸香
Rue.

923
01:22:21,686 --> 01:22:24,041
他们的死换来了什么
What do all those deaths mean?

924
01:22:26,956 --> 01:22:29,736
他们的死意味着我们的生死由不得自己控制
They mean that our lives
were never ours.

925
01:22:32,756 --> 01:22:36,941
我们算不上活着 因为我们连选择的余地都没有
There was no real life,
because we didn't have any choice.

926
01:22:38,866 --> 01:22:42,956
我们的生死 斯诺说了算
Our lives, belong to Snow
and our deaths do too.

927
01:22:44,936 --> 01:22:47,605
但是 如果你杀了他 凯妮丝
But if you kill him, Katniss.

928
01:22:48,476 --> 01:22:50,808
如果你终结了这一切
If you end all of this...

929
01:22:52,146 --> 01:22:56,653
我们的朋友就没有白死
All those deaths,
they mean something.

930
01:22:57,518 --> 01:22:59,208
辛纳
Salla.

931
01:22:59,385 --> 01:23:01,048
博格斯
Boggs.

932
01:23:01,080 --> 01:23:02,890
卡斯托
Castor.

933
01:23:02,915 --> 01:23:06,836
杰克逊. 芬尼克
Jackson.
Finnick.

934
01:23:08,696 --> 01:23:10,663
他们就死而无憾
They chose this.

935
01:23:14,089 --> 01:23:15,849
他们选择追随你的脚步
They chose you.

936
01:23:20,572 --> 01:23:24,589
伤口要保持干净  防止伤口感染
You should keep this clean,
otherwise it will get infected.

937
01:23:27,566 --> 01:23:29,336
你应该把我拷起来
You should cuff me.

938
01:23:30,254 --> 01:23:32,437
跟我待在一起不安全
It's not safe with me yet.

939
01:23:32,936 --> 01:23:35,382
我到过这里
I have moments when I'm here...

940
01:23:36,126 --> 01:23:38,660
我想起了更多的事
My memories are getting better,
but...

941
01:23:40,666 --> 01:23:43,196
但有些时候 我就像在梦游
Other times, it's like I'm sleepwalking.

942
01:23:48,285 --> 01:23:50,045
你真该把我拷起来
You should cuff me.

943
01:24:12,985 --> 01:24:15,649
谢谢你的水
Thanks, for the water.

944
01:24:22,352 --> 01:24:24,013
我睡不着
I can't sleep.

945
01:24:24,223 --> 01:24:26,690
嗯 我一连好几天都睡不着
Yeah, I haven't slept
in days either.

946
01:24:33,678 --> 01:24:37,182
第一次饥饿游戏的时候  我真该自愿把你换下来的
I should have volunteered to
take your place in the first Games.

947
01:24:38,256 --> 01:24:40,037
那么要是你那么做了
Well, you couldn't.

948
01:24:41,154 --> 01:24:43,479
那她会永远记恨你
And she-she'd never have forgiven you.

949
01:24:43,504 --> 01:24:46,973
她希望你照顾好她的家人 而你也的确这么做了
She wanted you to be there and
take care of her family and you did.

950
01:24:47,358 --> 01:24:49,292
她不能失去你
She can't lose you.

951
01:24:51,835 --> 01:24:53,719
她真的爱你
She really loves you.

952
01:24:56,206 --> 01:25:00,344
你看她在世纪争霸赛亲吻你的样子
The way she kissed you
in the Quarter Quell.

953
01:25:00,369 --> 01:25:02,592
她可从来没那么亲过我
She never kissed me like that.

954
01:25:02,726 --> 01:25:05,036
盖尔 你知道那只是逢场作戏而已
You know it's part of the show, Gale.

955
01:25:05,776 --> 01:25:07,799
不 是你赢得了她的心
No, you won her over.

956
01:25:08,386 --> 01:25:10,662
你为她放弃了一切
You gave up everything for her.

957
01:25:15,926 --> 01:25:18,406
这不是个大问题
It's not going to be
an issue much longer.

958
01:25:19,256 --> 01:25:21,299
不知道我们三个人能否一起平安的完成这个任务
I doubt all 3 of us are going
to make it out of this.

959
01:25:21,324 --> 01:25:23,120
若是我们都活下来了
And if we do, then...

960
01:25:24,536 --> 01:25:26,962
选谁就由她自己决定 对吧
It's her problem who to choose, right?

961
01:25:27,329 --> 01:25:28,427
是啊
Yeah.

962
01:25:28,458 --> 01:25:32,399
但是呢  我总觉得她谁都选不出来
Well, I do know that Katniss will pick
whoever she can't survive without.

963
01:25:37,016 --> 01:25:40,294
机动防爆盾  不是我们的
Mortar shells.
It's not ours.

964
01:25:40,586 --> 01:25:43,986
政府军一定是用它们把起义军挡在城市外头了
Peacekeepers must shelling
the rebels outside the city.

965
01:25:44,011 --> 01:25:46,307
算不上是城市外头
That's not outside the city.

966
01:25:53,539 --> 01:25:54,775
太阳出来了
Sun's coming up.

967
01:25:54,800 --> 01:25:57,540
我听到一些微弱的枪声  可能是佩勒或者是莱姆的部队攻过来了
There's some small arms fire.
Could be Paylor maybe Lyme.

968
01:25:57,565 --> 01:25:59,207
起义军已经逼近了
The rebels are close.

969
01:25:59,232 --> 01:26:00,821
就是这儿了
This is it.

970

To all Capitol citizens more than
half a mile outside the city circle.

972
01:26:16,316 --> 01:26:20,161
现在要强制疏散
I'm announcing a mandatory evacuation.

973
01:26:20,186 --> 01:26:25,231
都到我的宅邸这边来  我给你们提供避难所
Come to the mansion.

And you will have my solemn oath
to protect you until my dying breath.

978
01:26:41,022 --> 01:26:42,722
你们应该快点赶上这末班车
You should hurry up
with that last part.

979
01:26:42,747 --> 01:26:47,239
我们的敌人可一点都不如我们
Our enemies are not like us.
They do not share our values.

980
01:26:47,503 --> 01:26:51,745
他们提供不了我们的庇护
They have never known
our comfort and our sophistication.

981
01:26:51,770 --> 01:26:55,201
他们还鄙视我们提供的庇护  你们千万不要搞错
And they despise us for it.
Make no mistake.

982
01:26:55,226 --> 01:26:58,561
他们不是来解放我们的
They are not coming
to liberate us.

983
01:26:58,586 --> 01:27:02,248
他们是来摧毁我们的生活
They are coming to
destroy our way of life.

984
01:27:02,826 --> 01:27:06,854
他们会埋葬我们
They are coming to bury us.

985
01:27:08,052 --> 01:27:10,422
他现在还在大楼里吗
Is he still in the mansion?

986
01:27:11,389 --> 01:27:12,639
皮塔
Peeta?

987
01:27:12,664 --> 01:27:15,503
是的  我认得这房间
Yeah.
I recognize the room.

988
01:27:16,756 --> 01:27:18,386
在哪儿
Where's that?

989
01:27:19,209 --> 01:27:21,531
隔着五个街道
About 5 blocks away.

990
01:27:21,979 --> 01:27:25,088
我们就在这里  不是在主干道上
We are right here,
off the avenues.

991
01:27:25,113 --> 01:27:28,148
大楼就在这里  岗楼呢
- The mansion is here
- What about the Pods?

992
01:27:28,173 --> 01:27:32,147
他们有可能会关掉这边的岗楼  以增援受攻击的地方
Well, they'd probably deactivate the
Pods around here for the resident safety.

993
01:27:32,172 --> 01:27:33,929
能行的
That could work.

994
01:27:34,996 --> 01:27:36,280
我能再靠近一些
I can get close enough.

995
01:27:36,305 --> 01:27:38,133
每一个治安官都会待命
Every peacekeeper is
going to be waiting.

996
01:27:38,158 --> 01:27:40,914
随时准备干掉我们几个
Next to our faces
on every billboard.

thousands of refugees,

1000

just get into that stream
and don't look up.

1001
01:27:56,682 --> 01:27:58,445
我们只有一次机会
We got one shot.

Katniss, let me come with you, okay?

1009
01:28:30,716 --> 01:28:32,390
我可以作为诱饵吸引他们的注意力..
I can be a good distraction
that they know I'm...

不 我不想再失去你一次了

你和我们待在一起很安全
You'll be safer with us.

1012
01:28:35,076 --> 01:28:38,396
要是政府军搜查这些屋子 如果他被抓住了..
What if peacemakers are searching
the houses, and if he's captured...

1013
01:28:38,426 --> 01:28:41,418
那就给我一个自杀药丸 我不怕死
Then, give me a nightlock pill, okay.
I'm not going back.

1014
01:29:10,116 --> 01:29:11,809

01:34:37,360 --> 01:34:40,646
大门会定期打开
The gates will open momentarily.

1040
01:34:40,671 --> 01:34:44,336
我们会优先接纳儿童
The children will be received first.

1041
01:34:45,909 --> 01:34:50,341
保持镇定 把您的孩子送到前面来
Stay calm.
Bring your children forward.

1042
01:34:50,575 --> 01:34:53,755
大门会定期打开
The gates will open momentarily.

1043
01:34:53,780 --> 01:34:57,515
我们会优先接纳儿童
The children will be received first.

1044
01:34:58,409 --> 01:35:02,846
保持镇定 把您的孩子送到前面来
Stay calm.
Bring your children forward.

1045
01:35:03,014 --> 01:35:06,361
大门会定期打开
The gates will open momentarily.

1046
01:35:06,385 --> 01:35:10,152
我们会优先接纳儿童
The children will be received first.

1047
01:35:20,057 --> 01:35:22,124
那是都城军的飞机
It's the Capitol.

1048
01:36:22,012 --> 01:36:24,026
医生！
Medic!

1049
01:36:26,055 --> 01:36:27,795
大夫！
Medic!

1050
01:36:28,972 --> 01:36:30,461
-这里有伤员！ -快来破拆大门！
- Medic!
- Make a hole!

1051
01:36:30,486 --> 01:36:32,176
医生来了
Medics coming in.

1052
01:36:32,201 --> 01:36:34,244
拿个担架来
Bring a stretcher!

1053
01:36:38,606 --> 01:36:40,077
普瑞姆
Prim.

1054
01:36:40,260 --> 01:36:41,884
普瑞姆
Primrose.

1055
01:36:43,216 --> 01:36:44,692
普瑞姆！
Prim!

1056
01:37:24,516 --> 01:37:27,333
你醒了.躺好别动
Hey.
I need you to lie back.

1057
01:37:28,126 --> 01:37:32,475
身体没什么大碍 一切都很好
You're okay.
Everything's going to be okay.

1058
01:37:36,058 --> 01:37:41,016
都城军的飞机在官邸门口投下炸弹后战斗就结束了
The fight was over after that Capitol dropped
those bombs at the feet of the palace.

1059
01:37:42,306 --> 01:37:44,588
起义军直接攻进去了
The rebels walked right in.

1060
01:37:46,736 --> 01:37:50,481
凯妮丝 别乱动
Don't, Katniss.
The only one's working.

1061
01:37:51,302 --> 01:37:53,505
每个人都感受到了炸弹的冲击力
Everybody felt it.

1062
01:37:54,632 --> 01:37:59,602
有些政府军、宫殿守卫的孩子也在人群中
Peacemakers. Palace Guards.
They had kids in there too.

1063
01:38:00,486 --> 01:38:02,192
都被炸死
It was...

1064
01:38:07,286 --> 01:38:09,331
没几个人幸存下来
It was over after that.

1065
01:38:19,472 --> 01:38:20,964
妈
Mom.

1066
01:38:34,738 --> 01:38:37,671
我还记得我第一次带你来这的时候
I remember the first
time I brought you here.

1067
01:38:39,226 --> 01:38:41,331
我们当时来过这
And here we are.

1068
01:38:43,349 --> 01:38:45,848
我把你的随身物品都带来了
I've brought all your things.

1069
01:38:56,106 --> 01:38:59,140
那你先收拾一下
Well, I'll leave you to get settled.

1070
01:40:22,285 --> 01:40:24,974
您好女士 我不能让您进去
Sorry, ma'am.
I can't let you pass.

1071
01:40:25,096 --> 01:40:26,750
让她进去
Let her in.

1072
01:40:26,802 --> 01:40:28,657
我授权的
On my authority.

1073
01:40:28,682 --> 01:40:31,516
她有进去查看的资格
She has a right to
anything behind that door.

1074
01:40:58,032 --> 01:41:00,255
那朵白玫瑰不错
That's a nice one.

1075
01:41:00,983 --> 01:41:03,635
多么纯洁的白色啊
The colors are lovely, of course,

1076
01:41:04,006 --> 01:41:07,126
然而某些人暗中的勾当要比这花肮脏的多
but nothing says perfection like white.

1077
01:41:08,346 --> 01:41:10,932
我就知道你会来的
I was hoping you'd
find your way here.

1078
01:41:12,112 --> 01:41:14,977
我有很多事情想与你探讨一番
There are so many things
we should discuss.

1079
01:41:19,082 --> 01:41:23,141
但我有预感我们这次的见面时间不会太长 所以
But I have a feeling your
visit will be brief. So,

1080
01:41:23,166 --> 01:41:25,305
先说重要的事情
first things first.

1081
01:41:33,083 --> 01:41:38,247
首先我对你妹妹的去世感到十分遗憾
I wanted to tell you
how very sorry I am about your sister.

1082
01:41:38,989 --> 01:41:42,792
她的死本来是可以避免的
So wasteful, so unnecessary.

1083
01:41:43,006 --> 01:41:46,391
明眼人都知道那时大局已定
Anyone could see the game
was over by that point.

1084
01:41:46,416 --> 01:41:51,190
事实上 在他们扔下那些炸弹时我正准备签署官方投降令
In fact, I was just about to issue an official
surrender when they released those parachutes.

1085
01:41:51,215 --> 01:41:53,791
明明是都城军扔下了这些炸弹
You released those parachutes.

1086
01:41:53,816 --> 01:41:56,131
你真的觉得我会下这样的命令？
You really think I gave the order?

1087
01:41:56,156 --> 01:41:59,201
我们都清楚我一定不会伤害儿童
We both know
I'm not above killing children,

1088
01:41:59,226 --> 01:42:01,706
我不会毫无目的的杀戮
but I'm not wasteful.

1089
01:42:01,731 --> 01:42:05,111
我的杀戮都是有特殊目的的
I take life for
specific reasons.

1090
01:42:05,136 --> 01:42:09,641
试问我为什么要杀掉这么多都城的孩子
And there was no reason for me to
destroy a pen full of Capitol children.

1091
01:42:09,666 --> 01:42:11,494
我完全没有这么做的必要
None at all.

1092
01:42:17,206 --> 01:42:22,144
不得不承认科因的这步棋真是高明
I must concede it was a
masterful move on Coin's part.

1093
01:42:22,386 --> 01:42:28,468
她让大家认为我轰炸那些无助的儿童只是为了抵挡住叛军的脚步
The idea that I was bombing our own
helpless children to hold back the Rebels.

1094
01:42:29,486 --> 01:42:32,271
我的卫兵因此倒戈相向
It turned the last of
my guards against me.

1095
01:42:32,296 --> 01:42:36,856
所以他们一枪没放就攻占了都城和我的宅邸
There was no resistance left inside
the Capitol or the mansion.

1096
01:42:37,296 --> 01:42:40,878
你难道不知道战斗的过程是全程直播的吗？
Did you know it aired live?

1097
01:42:42,536 --> 01:42:46,951
这个方法真是十分巧妙啊 不是吗？
There's a...
particular savvy in that, isn't there?

1098
01:42:49,906 --> 01:42:54,501
我知道她不是故意夺去你妹妹的生命的
I'm sure she wasn't gunning
for your sister, but...

1099
01:42:55,316 --> 01:42:57,922
但这些事的的确确的发生了
These things happen in war.

1100
01:42:59,586 --> 01:43:04,954
我的失误在于没能早点猜到科因的意图
My failure was being so slow
to grasp Coin's plan.

1101
01:43:05,326 --> 01:43:08,901
她让都城和其它区自相残杀
She let the Capitol and the
districts destroy one another,

1102
01:43:08,926 --> 01:43:14,095
然后她登台掌控大权 我终于明白了她的计划
and she step in to take power
over Thirteen, I see.

1103
01:43:14,806 --> 01:43:17,143
要是我没想错的话
But make no mistake.

1104
01:43:17,168 --> 01:43:20,027
她现在想替代我，当上总统
She intends to take
my place now.

1105
01:43:21,446 --> 01:43:25,523
但我一直以来注意力都集中在你身上
But, I've been watching you.

1106
01:43:25,626 --> 01:43:28,210
你也只想一心杀了我
And you watching me.

1107
01:43:29,116 --> 01:43:32,521
恐怕我们都上当了
I'm afraid we have both
been played for fools.

1108
01:43:35,826 --> 01:43:37,675
我不相信你
I don't believe you

1109
01:43:38,496 --> 01:43:41,247
噢我亲爱的艾佛丁小姐
Oh, my dear Miss Everdeen.

1110
01:43:41,526 --> 01:43:46,742
我想我们以前承诺过绝不对对方说谎吧
I thought we had agreed
never to lie to each other.

1111
01:44:03,846 --> 01:44:06,010
科因总统想见你
President Coin ask for you.

1112
01:44:06,356 --> 01:44:08,659
你怎么这么久才来看我
You never came to see me.

1113
01:44:11,956 --> 01:44:15,100
-我本想早点来的 -那飞机是起义军的吗？
- I wanted to.
- Was it ours?

1114
01:44:16,266 --> 01:44:17,739
是我们扔下的炸弹吗？
The bomb?

1115
01:44:18,936 --> 01:44:21,367
延时的爆炸？
The delayed explosion.

1116
01:44:22,566 --> 01:44:24,066
这是一个陷阱
The trap.

1117
01:44:26,002 --> 01:44:28,241
延时爆炸是为了让更多的人掉进这个陷阱
To draw more people in.

1118
01:44:31,088 --> 01:44:32,854
这是起义军安排好的吗？
Is that you?

1119
01:44:35,006 --> 01:44:36,746
我不知道
I don't know.

1120
01:44:37,452 --> 01:44:39,553
我知道的是
All I know is,

1121
01:44:39,889 --> 01:44:43,084
我本应该照顾好你的家人
I'm suppose to take
care of your family.

1122
01:44:47,379 --> 01:44:49,521
对不起 我没能办到
And I'm sorry I couldn't.

1123
01:44:53,896 --> 01:44:56,702
在竞技场里你谁都保护不了
You can't protect
anyone in an Arena.

1124
01:45:13,195 --> 01:45:15,157
盖尔 你走吧
Goodbye, Gale.

1125
01:45:32,212 --> 01:45:33,487
这是什么情况
What's this?

1126
01:45:33,512 --> 01:45:36,730
这些是幸存下来的胜利者. 来一起开个会吧
The remaining Victors.
Won't you join us?

1127
01:45:48,286 --> 01:45:51,642
邀请你们来这开会有几个目的 首先
I've invited you all here for
several reasons, but first...

1128
01:45:51,667 --> 01:45:52,935
我宣布
I have an announcement.

1129
01:45:52,960 --> 01:45:55,237
我光荣的成为了
I am taking the burden

1130
01:45:55,262 --> 01:46:00,260
帕纳姆国的临时总统
and the honor of declaring
myself interim President of Panem.

1131
01:46:01,936 --> 01:46:03,332
临时的？
Interim?

1132
01:46:03,357 --> 01:46:06,451
这个临时的时间段大概有多长
Exactly how long
is that interim?

1133
01:46:06,475 --> 01:46:09,283
这个恐怕不太好说
We have no way
of knowing for certain.

1134
01:46:09,576 --> 01:46:12,055
大家也都知道现在社会还比较动荡
But, it's clear that people
are far too emotional

1135
01:46:12,080 --> 01:46:14,661
民众难以做出理性的决定
right now to make a
rational decision.

1136
01:46:14,686 --> 01:46:17,456
当时机成熟了我们会举行选举的
We'll plan an election
when the time is right.

1137
01:46:17,481 --> 01:46:22,659
我叫你们来是因为有一个更重要的事情需要决定
But I've called you here
for a far more important vote.

1138
01:46:22,684 --> 01:46:24,901
我们会进行象征性的投票表决
A symbolic vote.

1139
01:46:24,926 --> 01:46:28,909
今天下午我们将处决斯诺
This afternoon we will execute Snow.

1140
01:46:29,666 --> 01:46:32,412
和他的百余名同党
Hundreds of his accomplices
also await their deaths.

1141
01:46:32,437 --> 01:46:37,611
包括一些都城的官员，守卫，政府军士兵
Capitol officials, peacekeepers,
torturers, gamemakers.

1142
01:46:37,636 --> 01:46:39,377
但问题来了 一旦我们开了这个头
But the danger is,
once we begin

1143
01:46:39,402 --> 01:46:42,714
起义军复仇的欲望就会一发不可收拾
the rebels will not stop
calling for retribution.

1144
01:46:42,739 --> 01:46:47,115
民众会变得嗜血
Thirst for blood is a
difficult urge to satisfy.

1145
01:46:47,346 --> 01:46:52,531
所以 我这提供一个备选项
So...
I offer an alternative plan.

1146
01:46:52,556 --> 01:46:56,327
四人同意即通过该提议 不能弃权
A majority of four may approve it.
No one may abstain.

1147
01:46:56,856 --> 01:46:59,071
我的提议如下
The proposal is this.

1148
01:46:59,096 --> 01:47:04,462
我们可以象征性的举办一个饥饿游戏
In lieu of these
barbaric executions,

1149
01:47:04,487 --> 01:47:09,036
来代替野蛮的行刑过程
we hold a symbolic Hunger Games.

1150
01:47:19,076 --> 01:47:23,701
你又想逼迫都城的孩子进行一场饥饿游戏？
You want to have another Hunger Games
with the Capitol's children?

1151
01:47:24,168 --> 01:47:27,371
-你在逗我吗？ -我是认真的
- You're joking?
- Not in the slightest.

1152
01:47:28,446 --> 01:47:31,058
这是普鲁塔克的点子吗？
Is this Plutarch's idea?

1153
01:47:31,176 --> 01:47:32,975
这是我的提议
It was mine.

1154
01:47:33,485 --> 01:47:40,095
这既满足了公众复仇的欲望
It balances the need for revenge
with the least loss of human life.

1155
01:47:40,966 --> 01:47:43,591
-你们可以开始投票了 -我反对
- You may cast your votes.
- No.

1156
01:47:43,870 --> 01:47:45,647
我坚决反对 这个想法太疯狂了
No, obviously not.
This is crazy.

1157
01:47:45,671 --> 01:47:48,692
不 我觉得这样挺公平 斯诺自己有个孙女
No, I think it's more than fair.
Snow's got a granddaughter.

1158
01:47:48,717 --> 01:47:49,851
我投赞成票
I say, yes.

1159
01:47:49,876 --> 01:47:52,412
我也赞成 让他们也尝尝痛苦的滋味
So do I.
Let them have a taste of it.

1160
01:47:52,437 --> 01:47:55,861
你们要知道 正是我们这种复仇的想法引发了这场起义
You guys, this way of thinking is
what started these uprisings.

1161
01:47:55,886 --> 01:47:59,231
我和皮塔一样 投反对票
I vote no, with Peeta.

1162
01:47:59,256 --> 01:48:00,957
如果芬尼克还活着 他也会反对的
So would Finnick,
if he were here.

1163
01:48:00,982 --> 01:48:03,561
不 他会赞成的 因为斯诺杀了他
No, he's not,
because Snow killed him.

1164
01:48:03,586 --> 01:48:05,053
我反对
No.

1165
01:48:06,272 --> 01:48:09,344
我们不应该将他们再视作敌人了
We need to stop viewing
each other as enemies.

1166
01:48:10,915 --> 01:48:13,302
现在就看凯妮丝和海米奇了
It's down to Katniss and Haymitch.

1167
01:48:19,149 --> 01:48:21,221
我要亲手杀了斯诺
I get to kill Snow.

1168
01:48:21,906 --> 01:48:24,559
我不会拦着你的

1183
01:51:04,766 --> 01:51:11,068
我们将见证一个伸张正义的历史时刻
We are gathered to witness
a historic moment of justice.

1184
01:51:11,346 --> 01:51:15,791
今天 在这场革命中我们最重要的伙伴

1185
01:51:15,816 --> 01:51:20,704
将射出那一箭 它将结束所有战争
will fire the shot

1186
01:51:21,303 --> 01:51:25,964
愿她的力量象征着暴君专政的终结

the end of tyranny

1187
01:51:25,989 --> 01:51:31,109

杀了他！
Kill him!

1195
01:53:59,739 --> 01:54:05,392
凯妮丝 我这么跟你说吧 你没让我失望
I'll say this for you, Katniss.
You don't disappoint.

1196
01:54:06,962 --> 01:54:10,385
普鲁塔克让我带一封信给你
Well, Plutarch gave
me a letter for you.

1197
01:54:10,410 --> 01:54:12,061
我不想看
I don't want it.

1198
01:54:12,412 --> 01:54:14,853
拜托 你能不能正常一点

1199
01:54:16,219 --> 01:54:19,638
好吧 我来读给您老听
Okay.
I'll read it for you.

1200
01:54:20,136 --> 01:54:24,608
凯妮丝 可能所有的帕纳姆都为你这一箭感到震惊
Katniss, maybe the country was
shocked tonight by your arrow,

1201
01:54:24,633 --> 01:54:26,821
但话说回来 也没那么令人惊讶
but once again
I was not.

1202
01:54:26,846 --> 01:54:29,994
我早就预料到你会这么做
You're exactly what
I believe you were.

1203
01:54:30,406 --> 01:54:34,091
我真希望能当面向你道个别 但现在科因和斯诺都死了
I wish I could give you a proper good bye
but with both Coin and Snow dead,

1204
01:54:34,116 --> 01:54:39,223
今晚我们将开会决定这个国家未来的命运 我没法抽空去见你
the fate of the country will be decided
tonight and I can't be seen at your side.

1205
01:54:39,516 --> 01:54:43,531
12个区的领导人将举行一个自由的选举
Tonight, the 12 district leaders
will call for a free election.

1206
01:54:43,556 --> 01:54:48,271
毋庸置疑 佩勒会当上总统 她是一个有理性的人
There's no doubt that Paylor will carry,
she's become the voice of reason.

1207
01:54:48,296 --> 01:54:51,700
很抱歉你又要身担重负
I'm sorry so much
burden fell on you.

1208
01:54:51,726 --> 01:54:54,192
但我知道你会直面这些困难
I know you'll never escape it.

1209
01:54:54,725 --> 01:54:56,516
为了这个国家的未来
But if I had to put
you through it again

1210
01:54:56,541 --> 01:54:59,882
很抱歉我要暂时将你保护起来
for this outcome.
I would.

1211
01:55:01,976 --> 01:55:03,385
战争已经结束了

1212
01:55:03,410 --> 01:55:05,920
我们现在处在一个相对稳定的阶段
We're in that sweet period
where everyone agrees

1213
01:55:05,945 --> 01:55:08,915
不用再像以前一样担惊受怕
not to repeat the recent horrors.

1214
01:55:09,312 --> 01:55:11,785
当然 我们人类总是反覆无常 愚蠢至极
Of course, we are
fickle stupid beings

1215
01:55:11,810 --> 01:55:16,006
总是忘记过去 经常自相残杀
with poor memories and a
great gift for self-destruction.

1216
01:55:17,079 --> 01:55:20,672
也许经过这场战争 我们才能学会许多
Although who knows?
Maybe this time we'll learn.

1217
01:55:21,656 --> 01:55:24,666
送你出都城时我会亲自保证你的安全
I've secured you a ride
out of the capital.

1218
01:55:24,696 --> 01:55:26,597
现在你最好远离公众视野
It's better for you
to be out of sight.

1219
01:55:26,622 --> 01:55:30,707
时机成熟时，佩勒指挥官会赦免你的
But when the time is right,
Commander Paylor will pardon you.

1220
01:55:30,736 --> 01:55:33,248
这个国家终于获得了和平
The country will find it's peace.

1221
01:55:33,273 --> 01:55:37,993
希望你的心境也能平和下来 普鲁塔克
And I hope you can find yours.
Plutarch.

1222
01:55:40,646 --> 01:55:42,190
现在去哪
What now?

1223
01:55:44,086 --> 01:55:47,782
回家 我们回家
Home.
We go home.

1224
01:55:52,656 --> 01:55:55,457
我得好好和你道个别才能放你走
I couldn't let you go
without a proper goodbye.

1225
01:56:01,516 --> 01:56:04,954

It's your job to take care
of yourself now, Katniss.

1226
01:56:07,822 --> 01:56:10,332
向我保证你会找到它
Promise me you'll find it.

1227
01:56:11,271 --> 01:56:12,942
找到什么？
Find what?

1228
01:56:13,986 --> 01:56:16,746
属于胜利者的生活方式
The life of a Victor.

1229
01:56:17,867 --> 01:56:20,801
-再见 -再见，孩子
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye, my girl.

1230
01:56:24,986 --> 01:56:27,358
别把自己变成一个陌生人
And you don't be a stranger.

1231
01:56:32,072 --> 01:56:34,843
-照顾好她 -我会的

1236
01:58:24,276 --> 01:58:27,069
她死了 永远都不会回来了！
She's dead and
she's not coming back!
