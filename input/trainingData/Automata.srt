这简直没法活了

24
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:10,930
我只告诉那个东西给查理刷毛
All I told him was brush him.

25
00:06:10,930 --> 00:06:14,340
查理  只是一条可爱的小狗
Brush Charlie. He was a good dog.

我的保险范围包括整个...

查理也是家人  但是那个东西杀了查理
Charlie was family unit and that thing killed him.

who couldn't harm a living being, even if you force it to.

52
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:43,460
什么  他妈的  你在暗示什么
What the fuck are you insinuating?

53
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:45,560

如果你能数数  你就能跳舞

下个星期一是新月

63
00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:53,830
我妹妹说  当新月的时候孩子就出生了

我们就该请个佣人了
we should have a domestic.

66
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,470
我相信公司能给我们找个体面的
I'm sure the company can get us a decent one.

67
00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:07,140
真希望孩子跟随着新月出世
I hope it comes with the new moon.

68
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:13,050
-你会数吗  -当然
-Can you count? -Of course.

69
00:09:13,050 --> 00:09:16,320
和我一起数  一  二  三  四
Then count with me. One, two, three, four.

70
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:20,720
跳舞就像数学  你会数数  你就会跳舞
Dancing is mathematical. If you can count, you can dance.

71
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,340
...将导致太阳辐射在1.25度
...will cause solar radiation at 1.25 degrees.

72
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:42,340
在墙体附近
Along the retaining wall during most of the days.

73
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:46,340
白天污染物微粒的含量
The contaminating particles, concentration levels

74

75
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:52,820
新信息

77
00:09:57,190 --> 00:09:59,110
日光将在12点前不可见
Daylight will not be visible until after 12 noon.

78
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:04,930
那是个PILGRIM7000  是CCA财产
It's a Pilgrim 7000, property of CCA...

79
00:10:04,930 --> 00:10:08,140
外墙的承建公司
the construction company in charge of the outer wall.

80
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:11,110
发现它的警察说它出了故障
The policeman who found it said it was malfunctioning

81
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:14,110
不得不使用暴力关闭它
and had to disconnect it using violence.

82
00:10:14,110 --> 00:10:15,940
他开枪了
He shot it.

83
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:17,980
-什么  -他开枪了
-What? -He shot it.

84
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:20,780
报告说这是正当防卫
The report says it was self-repairing.

85
00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:23,460
正当防卫  对一个机器人  你应该给他做个测试
Self-repairing? The unit? You should have run a few tests on the cop.

86
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:26,990
我们做了  酒精和甲胺测试呈阳性
We did. Positive for alcohol and methylamine.

87
00:10:26,990 --> 00:10:29,290
他目前正在接受调查
He's currently under investigation.

88
00:10:35,230 --> 00:10:38,570
那个白痴知道这个东西值多少钱么
Does that moron know how much this little toy is worth?

89
00:10:38,570 --> 00:10:41,200
该死
Goddamn it.

90
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,570
表面看上去没多大变化
You can't see any big changes at first sight,

91
00:10:43,570 --> 00:10:47,010
但是它的内部被大幅修改了
but there's been significant alterations performed inside the carcass.

92
00:10:47,010 --> 00:10:49,080
有人对它动了手脚
Someone's had fun with this toy.

93
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:51,780
系统变流器被改动了
The power system converter's been manipulated.

94
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:54,380
他们加了第二个直流电池作备用
They've added a second DC battery as a back-up.

95
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:57,750
而且...
And...

96
00:10:57,750 --> 00:10:59,690
补偿液也是新的
the compensation fluid is also new.

97
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,810
序列号没有被删除
The serial numbers haven't been erased.

98
00:11:24,810 --> 00:11:28,480
它们都完好无损
They're all intact.

99
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:34,200
我们能找到它们的来源吗
Can we track them down?

100
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,480
事实上
In fact,

101
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:38,860
有其他机器人也在使它们的序列号
it has parts of other units which also keep their serial numbers.

102
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:45,400
无聊的工作
Crappy job.

103
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:48,240
恰好相反  这是一个非常复杂的工作
Quite the contrary. This is a very sophisticated job.

104
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,800
要我说  做手脚的人就是个机械师
I'd say it's a clocksmith.

105
00:11:50,810 --> 00:11:52,480
虽然看起来他不在意
Although it looks like he wasn't concerned

106
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:53,770
隐藏元件的来源
about hiding the origin of the parts.

107
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:55,540
仿生内核怎么样了
What about the Biokernel?

108
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:58,850
它头部中了一枪  把它烧了
It's had a shot in the head. The Biokernel's fried.

109
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:06,250
不过  从我们在它身边发现的东西来看...
But judging by what was found next to it...

110
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:09,160
我觉得这台机器人的软件
I think it's quite safe to say that this unit's software

111
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:11,020
很可能被篡改来偷工具和零件了
was altered to smuggle tools and parts.

112
00:12:14,730 --> 00:12:16,360
这是给你的
This is for you.

113
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,530
这啥
What is this?

114
00:12:20,330 --> 00:12:21,730
账单
The bill.

115
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:24,100
ROC公司是不会为这堆垃圾付账的
ROC is not going to pay for all of this bullshit.

116
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:27,210
这是件没有主人的私改品
This is an altered unit without an owner.

117
00:12:27,210 --> 00:12:29,210
私改品就是非法品
An altered unit is an illegal unit.

118
00:12:29,210 --> 00:12:31,250
在这事消停之前
And until this conflict is solved,

119
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:33,810
ROC保险公司要为这期间的开销买单
ROC's insurance will have to cover the expenses.

120
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:35,880
而且根据那份报告
Besides, according to that report,

121
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:37,720
这机器人没有第二条原则
this is a unit without a second protocol.

122
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:40,250
这简直不可能...
Oh, you know that's plain stupid, right?

123
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:42,720
的确  但这次非比寻常
Sure. But unusual stupidity.

124
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,220
我从没见过这样的事
I've never seen this before.

125
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:46,990
杰克这堆废铁就是块烫手山芋
Jack, this clunker is a sticky mess

126
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,760
但总有人要接手的
and somebody's got to clean it up.

127
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:51,470
不过绝不是我
And believe me, I will not be that someone.

128
00:13:03,310 --> 00:13:04,670
一个没有第二条原则的机器人
A unit without the second protocol?

129
00:13:07,650 --> 00:13:09,720
这傻帽警察
Cop is nuts.

130
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:11,290
他当时嗑嗨了
He was high.

131
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:14,520
他说这台机器人当时在维修自己
He said the unit was repairing itself.

132
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:16,920
-那货当时嗑嗨了  -但事实是有人改动了他
-The guy was high. -The fact is that someone altered it. Maybe...

133
00:13:19,130 --> 00:13:20,190
或许是个贫民区的机械师
a clocksmith in the ghetto.

134
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:24,770
机械师
Clocksmiths.

135
00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:26,770
杰克  我们不是警察
We're not cops, Jack.

136
00:13:26,770 --> 00:13:28,700
我们就是保险业务员
We're just insurance agents.

137
00:13:29,370 --> 00:13:32,170
鲍伯  我在想也许...
Bob, I was thinking...

138
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:38,080
我能离开街道一段时间
about staying away from the streets for a little while.

139
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:39,320
离开这些脏兮兮的事儿
Staying away from all the filth.

140
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,650
你想干嘛  调职
What do you want, a transfer?

141
00:13:49,650 --> 00:13:51,790
有人说海边的环境会好点
Well, they say things are better on the Coast.

142
00:13:52,330 --> 00:13:55,130
海边
The Coast?

143
00:13:55,130 --> 00:13:57,100
现如今大家都过得不怎么样
Things are hard for everybody.

144
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:59,530
你也知道公司现在很困难
The company is struggling, you know that.

145
00:13:59,530 --> 00:14:02,000
和政府的合同还没着落
Contract with the city is up in the air.

146
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,600
现在正是大干一场的时候  而不是收拾走人
Now is the time to pitch in, not pack up.

147
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:09,340
我太累了
I am burnt out.

148
00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:11,610
真的再也受不了了
Can't take this anymore.

149
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:18,490
你好好看看你自己
Take a look at yourself.

150
00:14:18,490 --> 00:14:21,390
你就没想过你有多幸运
Have you ever considered how fortunate you are?

151
00:14:21,390 --> 00:14:25,060
你有一份不错的工作  住的地方也不错
You got a good job. You live in a great pod.

152
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:26,540
你还有一份健康保险
You have health insurance

153
00:14:26,550 --> 00:14:28,300
能让你和瑞秋生个漂亮的闺女
that allows you and Rachel to have a beautiful baby girl.

154
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:31,300
这日子已经很好了  杰克
It's a good life, Jack.

155
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:33,230
而你还要做什么才能维持现状吗
And you know all you have to do to keep it?

156
00:14:33,230 --> 00:14:35,340
找个帮你管着烂摊子的人
Find someone else to hold accountable for this mess.

157
00:14:38,570 --> 00:14:40,110
就这样
Just that.

158
00:14:40,110 --> 00:14:42,440
别老往坏处看
Quit looking in the garbage so much.

159
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:46,010
你就能知道你有多幸运了
Maybe you'll see how really lucky a guy you are.

160
00:14:53,150 --> 00:14:55,090
让我捋一捋
Let me get this straight.

161
00:14:55,090 --> 00:14:57,350
我7000型机器人中的一个
One of my 7000s has been found

162
00:14:57,350 --> 00:14:58,860
被逮到在非法交易零件
trafficking stolen parts?

163
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:02,060
而且那批铁皮还松了几个螺丝
Not only that, but the poor clunker has one or two loose screws?

164
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:04,530
这简直荒唐
That's dramatic.

165
00:15:04,530 --> 00:15:06,810
那台被射杀的7000型机器人身上
The 7000 that was shot had 25 different parts

166
00:15:06,810 --> 00:15:08,240
有25个部件不属于他
that didn't belong in it.

167
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,240
其中的一些零件就是从  在这工作的机器人身上摘的
Some of which are from units that also worked here.

168
00:15:12,110 --> 00:15:15,040
还有呢  或许...
And? Well, maybe...

169
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:17,810
你的某个员工试着改变...
one of your employees tried to change or...

170
00:15:17,810 --> 00:15:20,150
改造这些机器人
modify the unit.

171
00:15:20,150 --> 00:15:22,280
只有ROC公司才能维修这些机器人
Only ROC can repair robots.

172
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:25,220
只有这样我们才能保障安全
That's how we can guarantee security, sir.

173
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:26,220
安全个屁
Security, my ass.

174
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:30,020
你们的机器人干活一天比一天差
Your units work worse and worse every day.

175
00:15:32,590 --> 00:15:35,560
一个好的还被一人渣偷了
The ones that aren't broken are stolen by that scum.

176
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:37,900
所以如果你真这么关心安全问题
So, if you're so concerned about security,

177
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:40,330
何不自己去排查那堆垃圾
why don't you disinfect that dump?

178
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:44,940
狗屁保险
Fucking insurance.

179
00:16:12,630 --> 00:16:14,070
我们见一个杀一个
We shoot on sight.

180
00:16:14,070 --> 00:16:16,270
他们明知道这儿属于保密范围
They know it's a restricted area.

181
00:16:16,270 --> 00:16:18,390
我们所做的一切
All the work we do here

182
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:20,200
都是为了防那种人渣
is trying to prevent that scum

183
00:16:20,210 --> 00:16:22,710
以免他入侵城市
from invading the city.

184
00:16:22,710 --> 00:16:25,250
我以为墙是建来阻隔沙漠的
I thought the wall was built to protect us from the desert.

185
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:26,810
当然  飞机哪天也能上天
Sure. And planes will fly again one day.

186
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:31,490
这是什么
And what is this crap?

187
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:34,050
这零件是一个还在岗的7000型机器人的
These pieces are from a 7000 that's operative.

188
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:37,990
206号  第五区的焊接工
Number 206, a welder in Section 5.

189
00:16:54,870 --> 00:16:57,740
焊接工206号正在工作
Welder 206 currently on duty.

190
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:36,410
警告
Warning.

191
00:18:36,410 --> 00:18:37,910
你正离开城市警戒线
You are leaving the city limits

192
00:18:37,910 --> 00:18:40,450
进入禁止区域
and entering in a restricted area.

193
00:18:40,450 --> 00:18:45,120
至此城市将不再对您的安全负责
From this point on, the city is not responsible of your security.

194
00:19:18,950 --> 00:19:20,820
别开枪
Don't shoot!

195
00:19:46,150 --> 00:19:49,180
你手里拿的是什么
What do you have in there?

196
00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:51,180
你手里拿的是什么
What do you have in there?

197
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:56,220
你手里拿的是什么
What do you have in there?

198
00:20:14,410 --> 00:20:17,880
你手里拿的是什么
What do you have in there? What do you have in there?

199
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,880
你是说那个机器人离开了自己的工作区域...
So, the unit leaves its assigned workplace and...

200
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:36,630
然后放了把火...
escapes to set itself on fire...

201
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:41,770
把自己点着了
on its own.

202
00:20:41,770 --> 00:20:44,640
你是认真的
Are you serious?

203
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:47,170
他在盒子里放了些什么
What was it keeping inside the box?

204
00:20:47,170 --> 00:20:49,140
有几件工具
We have a few tools here.

205
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:50,440
这应该是...
These could be remains of...

206
00:20:53,780 --> 00:20:55,580
热传感器的部件
heat sensors.

207
00:20:55,580 --> 00:20:59,350
而这个就像是...
And I'd say this seems to be a...

208
00:20:59,350 --> 00:21:02,090
一个核能电池  在"大衰败"前
It's a nuclear battery. Before the regression,

209
00:21:02,090 --> 00:21:04,690
人们用它来驱动卫星
they used them to move satellites.

210
00:21:04,690 --> 00:21:08,290
这是种强大的电池  同时非常难找
It's a very powerful battery and very hard to come by.

211
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:10,330
你能把它安在机器人上吗
Can you install that in a Pilgrim?

212
00:21:10,330 --> 00:21:11,930
如果你想把它烧坏的话
Only if you want to barbecue it.

213
00:21:11,930 --> 00:21:13,630
不止如此
It's much more than that.

214
00:21:13,630 --> 00:21:16,030
在找机械能源的人
Anyone that's looking for autonomous power sources...

215
00:21:16,070 --> 00:21:17,700
会想要它们的
will appreciate them.

216
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:23,240
它能听见我们说话吗
Can it hear us?

217
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:24,280
应该能
It should.

218
00:21:32,150 --> 00:21:33,450
读取我的证件
Read my badge.

219
00:21:33,450 --> 00:21:35,820
说明你的身份
Identify yourself.

220
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:52,610
B-2  206  焊接组
B-2 206. Welder Section.

221
00:21:59,210 --> 00:22:00,010
好
All right.

222
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:07,720
我们在你手上找到这块电池
We found this battery in your hands.

223
00:22:08,050 --> 00:22:11,620
谁让你偷的
Who asked you to steal it?

224
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:14,130
找到这块电池
Found this battery.

225
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:18,130
你正往贫民区走
You were going to the ghetto.

226
00:22:20,870 --> 00:22:23,440
在那儿等你的是你的主人吗
Was your owner waiting for you there?

227
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:27,110
我没有主人  先生
I do not have an owner, sir.

228
00:22:34,950 --> 00:22:36,230
你为什么烧自己
Why did you set yourself on fire?

229
00:22:39,450 --> 00:22:41,890
你为什么...
Why did you set yourself...

230
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:50,660
该死  武尔坎
Shit, Vaucan.

231
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:52,130
你先是烤了它...
First you roast it.

232
00:22:52,130 --> 00:22:53,930
现在你把它弄哭了
Now you make it cry.

233
00:23:00,010 --> 00:23:02,170
马上  我就会接到一通要求我解释的电话
Soon, I'm going to get a call asking for an explanation.

234
00:23:04,780 --> 00:23:06,810
我见这些被篡改的机器人多了
I have seen altered units for years.

235
00:23:06,810 --> 00:23:09,950
但我对你发誓  今天这个不一样
But I swear to you, what I've seen today is different.

236
00:23:09,950 --> 00:23:12,890
它不一样了...你一定是疯了
It's something else. You're definitely nuts.

237
00:23:12,890 --> 00:23:15,460
你以为上层这几天是怎么想的
What kind of mood do you think the boys upstairs are in these days?

238
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:17,420
如果我们不把城市合约搞定
If we don't get the city to renew our contract,

239
00:23:17,420 --> 00:23:18,830
我们就等着喝西北风吧
we're all going down the tube.

240
00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:20,660
我知道  我知道
Okay, okay!

241
00:23:20,660 --> 00:23:22,420
如果我找到那个始作俑者了呢
What if I find the clocksmith behind all this?

242
00:23:25,630 --> 00:23:27,430
这都是因为调职的事
It's about the transfer.

243
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:29,300
这都是因为调职的事  是不是
This is all about the transfer, isn't it?

244
00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:32,810
上帝啊  杰克
Oh, Jesus, Jack.

245
00:23:36,870 --> 00:23:37,870
既然如此
Very well.

246
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:41,110
改掉你的报告  找到犯人  把案子结了
Change your report, find me a culprit, close the case,

247
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:44,450
我就让你调职
and you will have your farewell ticket.

248
00:23:44,450 --> 00:23:45,890
谁知道呢  杰克
Who knows, Jack?

249
00:23:45,890 --> 00:23:48,720
没准大海还在呢
Maybe the ocean is still there.

250
00:23:54,090 --> 00:23:57,360
第一台机器人出世的那一天  我爸把我带到这来
My old man brought me here the day the first unit came out.

251
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:59,870
23年前了
23 years ago.

252
00:23:59,870 --> 00:24:02,970
那时的对话我记忆犹新
I remember exactly what they said back then.

253
00:24:02,970 --> 00:24:05,370
PILGRIM为帮助人类
The Pilgrims were born to help us

254
00:24:05,370 --> 00:24:08,040
解决生存问题而生
in our heroic quest for survival.

255
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:10,680
现在它们为我们造房子  帮我们开车
Now they build our homes, drive our cars,

256
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:13,180
当我们老了为我们料理后事
and wipe our asses when we get old.

257
00:24:13,180 --> 00:24:15,850
我跟本不知道接下来该干什么了
I have no idea what we're going to do next.

258
00:24:15,850 --> 00:24:17,950
撤销那两条原则~
Maybe eliminate the protocols.

259
00:24:17,950 --> 00:24:20,350
肯定的
Sure.

260
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:24,220
试着想象下...
Imagine for a moment...

261
00:24:24,220 --> 00:24:27,430
那个机器人把自己点着了...
that the unit had set itself on fire. No, I...

262
00:24:27,430 --> 00:24:30,600
不不不  你就想想看...
No, no, just, just, just imagine.

263
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:33,200
如果它对自己行使暴力...
If it was using violence against itself...

264
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:36,570
这就是在违反第二条原则啊
it would actually be breaking the second protocol, wouldn't it?

265
00:24:36,570 --> 00:24:38,770
技术上讲  是的  但还有个小问题
Of course, technically. But the little problem

266
00:24:38,770 --> 00:24:41,610
原则植入在仿生内核里
is the protocols reside within the Biokernel,

267
00:24:41,610 --> 00:24:44,410
并且都经过量子加密
which itself is based on a quantum encryption.

268
00:24:44,410 --> 00:24:48,050
它的安全系统是条单向道
Their security system is a one-way road.

269
00:24:48,050 --> 00:24:52,350
一旦更改原则  就会毁坏仿生内核
If you try and change the protocols, you destroy the Biokernel.

270
00:24:52,350 --> 00:24:55,660
这就像把肥皂泡放在口袋里
It's kind of like trying to keep a soap bubble in your pocket.

271
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:57,780
没人干过因为这根本不可能
No one's ever done it before because you simply can't.

272
00:24:59,290 --> 00:25:00,290
你明白吗
Do you get it?

273
00:25:00,890 --> 00:25:03,260
嘿
Hey.

274
00:25:04,770 --> 00:25:07,830
里面的世界怎么样
How's everything in there?

275
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:10,760
外边有人等不及要给你换尿布了
There are people out here who are looking forward to changing your diapers.

276
00:25:13,310 --> 00:25:15,190
有人一夜不想合眼
People who don't want to sleep a wink all night.

277
00:25:15,940 --> 00:25:18,440
有人想结束这片沉寂
People who want the silence to be over.

278
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:24,580
欢迎  武尔坎先生
Welcome, Mr. Vaucan.

279
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:31,890
哇
Wow.

280
00:25:31,890 --> 00:25:33,790
她看起来很高兴见到你
Looks like she's happy to see you.

281
00:25:36,790 --> 00:25:40,830
你猜她会不会介意我带他妈妈出去吃饭
Do you think she'd mind if I take her mom out to dinner?

282
00:25:49,310 --> 00:25:51,670
我猜想今晚你一定有些特殊的好理由
I guess there must be a good reason for such a special night.

283
00:25:52,950 --> 00:25:55,110
我们就要有孩子了  这就是个好理由
We are going to be a family. That is a good reason.

284
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:05,760
离开这个地方也是个好理由
Maybe leaving this place could be another good reason.

285
00:26:07,060 --> 00:26:09,160
离开  去哪
Leaving? Where?

286
00:26:11,670 --> 00:26:13,350
你感受过海边的微风吗
Have you ever felt the breeze of the ocean?

287
00:26:16,170 --> 00:26:18,690
我知道我们以前谈过  但现在不一样了
I know we have already talked about this. But now it's different.

288
00:26:21,110 --> 00:26:23,880
现在我们有机会离开这里了
Now there's a real opportunity to get out of here.

289
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:25,480
鲍伯会帮我调职
Bob can get me a transfer.

290
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:26,750
瑞秋
Rachel.

291
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:31,920
之后我们又要去干什么呢
And what are we going to do?

292
00:26:31,990 --> 00:26:34,950
在限期前坐上公车去另一座城市
Get on a bus and start from scratch

293
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:37,160
让一切从头开始
in another city with an expiration date?

294
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:39,490
-你就要有女儿了杰克  -我知道
-You're about to have a daughter, Jack. -I know. I know.

295
00:26:39,490 --> 00:26:43,600
-所以你到底想去哪  -一个还有未来的地方
-Where the hell do you want to go? -Where there is a damn future.

296
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:51,270
未来肯定就在某个地方
There has to be one somewhere.

297
00:26:51,270 --> 00:26:54,270
你怎么知道在海边日子就会比较好
How do you know it'll be any better on the coast?

298
00:26:54,270 --> 00:26:55,950
看在上帝的份上瑞秋  你好好看看这个地方
For God's sake, Rachel, look at this. Look.

299
00:26:58,750 --> 00:27:00,980
空气无法呼吸  雨水无法触碰
Air we cannot breathe. Rain we cannot touch.

300
00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:03,460
你难道就不怕把女儿带到这样的地方
Aren't you afraid to bring your daughter into a place like this?

301
00:27:05,390 --> 00:27:08,720
你怎么变得这么可悲
How can you be such a wretch?

302
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:11,890
我已经无法承受担惊受怕
I can't afford to be afraid.

303
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:17,660
告诉我你不后悔...
Tell me you don't regret it.

304
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:23,070
告诉我  杰克
Tell me, Jack.

305
00:27:26,770 --> 00:27:27,870
是你坚持要的
You insisted.

306
00:27:36,450 --> 00:27:38,320
确实  是我自找的
That's true, I insisted.

307
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:39,750
现在  请你滚出这儿
Now, get out of here, please.

308
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:42,760
-瑞秋...-让我一个人待会...
-Rachel... -Leave me alone.

309
00:28:20,730 --> 00:28:22,260
请小心  先生
Be careful, sir.

310
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:25,000
雨水有害您的健康
The rain can be hazardous to your health.

311
00:28:38,950 --> 00:28:40,680
拜托了  先生
Please, sir.

312
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:44,120
我的主人很饿  拜托了先生
My owner is hungry. Please, sir.

313
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:01,300
你是小机的朋友吗
Are you a friend of Bot's?

314
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:04,600
小机是个好机器人
Bot was kind.

315
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:40,810
小机是个好机器人
Bot was kind.

316
00:29:47,510 --> 00:29:49,850
我没撒谎
I ain't fooling anybody.

317
00:29:49,850 --> 00:29:51,450
我确实偶尔会夸大事实
Yeah, I crank up once in a while.

318
00:29:51,450 --> 00:29:54,450
我们都这么干  但这事儿有下线
We all do over here, but I know the limits.

319
00:29:54,450 --> 00:29:57,490
而且我分得清那机器人是在修管子
And I definitely know the difference between a clunker welding a pipe

320
00:29:57,490 --> 00:29:59,990
还是在修自己的腿
and another one welding his fucking leg.

321
00:29:59,990 --> 00:30:01,930
能证明你没疯的唯一方式
The only way to prove you're not crazy

322
00:30:01,930 --> 00:30:04,130
就是找到那个改动了机器人的机械师
is to find the clocksmith who altered that unit.

323
00:30:04,130 --> 00:30:05,370
是的  我明白
Yeah, right. Maybe,

324
00:30:05,370 --> 00:30:07,870
没准华莱士你该在报纸上登个广告
Wallace, you should place an ad in the paper

325
00:30:07,870 --> 00:30:08,440
或者更好的是
or better yet,

326
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:09,440
换个毒贩子
find a new dealer.

327
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:10,820
爱怎么想怎么想
Yeah, think what you want,

328
00:30:10,820 --> 00:30:13,280
但我真看见那个机器人掏自己内脏了
but I saw that clunker turn its guts inside out.

329
00:30:13,670 --> 00:30:15,210
就这样
End of story.

330
00:30:15,210 --> 00:30:18,420
该死  滚开
Fucking cripple. Get out of the road!

331
00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:20,590
你的想法就是命令  先生
Your wish is my command, sir.

332
00:30:20,590 --> 00:30:21,750
你这块废铁  快滚
Piece of shit, move!

333
00:30:22,850 --> 00:30:24,850
该死的废物
Fucking animals.

334
00:30:24,850 --> 00:30:27,290
它在盯着我
It was staring at me.

335
00:30:27,290 --> 00:30:30,160
举起它的手  就像它知道在发生什么一样
Hid its hands like that motherfucker was fully aware.

336
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:32,860
它在干些不该干的事
It was doing something it wasn't supposed to do.

337
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:36,960
埃利斯  我不是因为它盯着我看才开枪的
Ellis, I didn't shoot that clunker because it was staring at me.

338
00:30:38,170 --> 00:30:41,000
我开枪是因为...
I shot it because...

339
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,600
我开枪是因为它看起来...
I shot it because it looked...

340
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:43,740
像活的
Alive?

341
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:51,010
我是认真的
I was being serious.

342
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:55,080
你看的只可能是机械师的杰作  还是个厉害的
What you saw can only be the work of a clocksmith. A good one at that.

343
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:58,020
想不被人当傻子
The only way they won't take you for a fool

344
00:30:58,020 --> 00:31:00,150
就找到他
is to find him.

345
00:31:00,150 --> 00:31:03,290
我不了解城里  但在这儿
I don't know about the city, but here, among the filth,

346
00:31:03,290 --> 00:31:05,990
贫民窟里  机械师可不好找
clocksmiths aren't listed in the phone books.

347
00:31:05,990 --> 00:31:08,330
你甚至无从找起
You wouldn't even know where to begin.

348
00:31:08,330 --> 00:31:10,360
好吧  或许...
Well, maybe...

349
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:12,130
核能电池能帮上忙
a nuclear battery would help.

350
00:31:15,970 --> 00:31:17,400
你有核能电池
You have a nuclear battery?

351
00:32:15,260 --> 00:32:16,600
克莱奥.
Cleo

352
00:32:20,070 --> 00:32:22,370
你命令  她服从
You ask, she obeys.

353
00:32:36,550 --> 00:32:38,750
这机器人能干这事儿
This unit can do these things?

354
00:32:38,750 --> 00:32:41,390
克莱奥  你问她好吗
Cleo. You ask her, okay?

355
00:33:09,180 --> 00:33:11,680
别害怕
Do not be afraid.

356
00:33:11,690 --> 00:33:16,260
我能完美区别愉快与疼痛
I can distinguish perfectly between pleasure and pain.

357
00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:21,930
你能制造疼痛吗
Can you cause pain?

358
00:33:21,930 --> 00:33:23,830
如果你想要的话
Only if it's your wish.

359
00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:31,600
你改动过它
Have you altered it?

360
00:33:31,610 --> 00:33:34,640
-克莱奥  没有问题  -给她看电池
-Cleo is all okay. -Show her the battery.

361
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:37,540
-不  直到我知道她就是那个人之前  -嘿  你
-No, not until I know she's the one we're looking for. -Hey, you.

362
00:33:37,540 --> 00:33:39,580
我们要见给你造这垃圾的人
We need to meet who made you this piece of filth.

363
00:33:39,580 --> 00:33:42,950
不是垃圾  克莱奥比你老婆还厉害
No filth. Cleo better than your wife.

364
00:33:42,950 --> 00:33:44,780
我已经没有老婆了
I don't have a wife anymore.

365
00:33:44,780 --> 00:33:47,490
-嘿  冷静点  -闭嘴
-Hey, come on. -Shut up!

366
00:33:47,490 --> 00:33:49,660
那个机械师是谁
Come on. Who the fuck's the clocksmith?

367
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:50,660
没有机械师  滚  滚  滚
No clocksmith! Out! Out! Out!

368
00:33:50,660 --> 00:33:52,420
那个机械师是谁
Who's the clocksmith?

369
00:33:52,430 --> 00:33:53,430
你TM到底在干什么
What the hell are you doing?

370
00:33:54,030 --> 00:33:56,100
克莱奥  克莱奥
Cleo! Cleo!

371
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,470
嘿
Hey!

372
00:34:00,470 --> 00:34:01,470
克莱奥  克莱奥
Cleo. Cleo.

373
00:34:05,540 --> 00:34:06,310
嘿  你为什么开枪
Hey! Why did you do that?

374
00:34:06,310 --> 00:34:07,710
滚开
Get off.

375
00:34:07,710 --> 00:34:10,010
-我们就快得手了  -我叫你把手拿开
-We almost got it. -I said get your hands off me!

376
00:34:10,010 --> 00:34:12,380
就算你揍死那个狗娘养的
You could be clobbering the shit out of that dimwit son of a bitch.

377
00:34:12,380 --> 00:34:14,380
她也不会告诉你她的名字
She wouldn't even tell you her own name.

378
00:34:14,380 --> 00:34:16,350
现在  你只要等她把它带到商店里
You just have to wait for her to take it to the shop.

379
00:34:16,350 --> 00:34:18,880
你的机械师就在那里
Your clocksmith will be there.

380
00:34:18,890 --> 00:34:21,490
听着  我为你冒了很大的风险杰克
Listen, I've risked more than I should have for you, Jack.

381
00:34:21,490 --> 00:34:22,320
你最好准备好我的酬劳
You better get my cut ready.

382
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:24,120
我什么都不会给你
I am not paying you shit.

383
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:27,190
别TM想吓唬我
And don't even think about threatening me, you son of a bitch.

384
00:34:30,230 --> 00:34:31,830
你最好准备我的那份
You better get my cut ready.

385
00:34:31,830 --> 00:34:35,230
不然  下次让我见到你...
If not, next time I see you...

386
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:36,770
我就切断你的喉咙
maybe I cut your throat.

387
00:36:00,790 --> 00:36:01,790
我没带武器
I am not armed.

388
00:36:05,020 --> 00:36:06,820
我知道  你想干什么
I know that. What do you want?

389
00:36:14,330 --> 00:36:17,700
我是ROC保险部门的
I work for ROC insurance department.

390
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:19,940
我在追查两起机器人私改行为
I'm tracking down some alterations performed on two units.

391
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:22,010
这是其中一个机器人的内核
This is one of the unit's kernel.

392
00:36:24,540 --> 00:36:26,680
警察不知道该拿它怎么办
The police doesn't know what to do with it

393
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:29,050
而我也无法从ROC得到任何帮助
and I am not getting any help from ROC.

394
00:36:29,050 --> 00:36:31,150
帮我...
Help me out...

395
00:36:31,150 --> 00:36:32,820
这块电池就归你
and the battery is yours.

396
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:36,020
这块内核已经烧坏了
That kernel is burnt.

397
00:36:36,020 --> 00:36:37,860
那台机器人中枪了
That unit was shot.

398
00:36:37,860 --> 00:36:39,860
开枪的警察说它在维修自己
The cop who shot it swears it was repairing itself.

399
00:36:42,830 --> 00:36:45,560
第二台被改动的机器人在我面前自焚了
The second altered unit set itself on fire right in front of me.

400
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:51,870
我亲眼所见
I witnessed with my own eyes

401
00:36:51,870 --> 00:36:54,710
它对第二原则的违背
a violation of the second protocol.

402
00:36:54,710 --> 00:36:57,340
你吓到我了...
You're beginning to frighten me now.

403
00:37:02,150 --> 00:37:04,520
这听起来就这么荒唐
Why is it so absurd?

404
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:06,800
如果有人能让这些吸尘器...
If somebody could find a way for the vacuum cleaners to...

405
00:37:08,290 --> 00:37:09,460
自我维修...
fix themselves,

406
00:37:09,460 --> 00:37:12,460
ROC就会破产
ROC would sink.

407
00:37:13,430 --> 00:37:15,470
机械的自我维修是个非常复杂的概念
A machine altering itself is a very complex concept.

408
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:20,420
自我维修反映了某种意义上的意识
Self-repairing implies some idea of a conscience.

409
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:25,410
无从解释
Muddy waters.

410
00:37:26,610 --> 00:37:27,410
为什么
Why?

411
00:37:29,410 --> 00:37:32,140
你今天送来核能电池
You're here today trafficking in nuclear goods

412
00:37:32,150 --> 00:37:33,780
因为很久以前有只猴子
because a long time ago

413
00:37:33,780 --> 00:37:36,620
决定从树上下来了
a monkey decided to come down from a tree.

414
00:37:36,620 --> 00:37:38,950
大脑从猿类
Transitioning from the brain of an ape

415
00:37:38,950 --> 00:37:41,750
进化到你现在的认知能力
to your incredible intellectual prowess...

416
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:44,490
花了我们700万年的时间
took us about seven million years.

417
00:37:44,490 --> 00:37:46,730
这是条很长的路
It's been a very long road.

418
00:37:46,730 --> 00:37:50,000
但一台没有第二原则的机器人
A unit, however, without the second protocol

419
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,880
能在几周内完成这种进化
could travel that same road in just a few weeks.

420
00:37:54,470 --> 00:37:56,540
因为你的大脑是受限的
Because your brilliant brain has its limitations.

421
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:00,410
生理和心理都受限
Physical limitations. Biological limitations.

422
00:38:03,610 --> 00:38:05,810
但在这个铁皮脑袋里
However, this tin head?

423
00:38:05,810 --> 00:38:08,010
唯一的限制就是她的第二原则
The only limitations that she has is the second protocol.

424
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:14,450
第二原则之所以存在是因为
The second protocol exists because we don't know

425
00:38:14,450 --> 00:38:18,290
我们不知道逾越了它会发生什么
what can be beyond the second protocol.

426
00:38:18,290 --> 00:38:20,690
一旦原则被解除  天知道机器人会发展成什么样
If it were eliminated, who knows how far that vacuum could go.

427
00:38:24,330 --> 00:38:27,200
-所以这是可能的  -我可没这么说
-So, it can be done. -I didn't say that.

428
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:29,800
总之  我不认识有这种能力的人
Anyway, I don't know anybody good enough to do something like that.

429
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:35,670
-你叫什么  -对你而言  杜普雷博士
-What's your name? -For you, Dr. Duprè.

430
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:38,480
好的  杜普雷博士
All right, Dr. Duprè.

431
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:40,510
我去过贫民窟
I have been to the ghetto.

432
00:38:40,510 --> 00:38:42,980
我目睹了机器人的"归宿"
I have seen how the units end up.

433
00:38:42,980 --> 00:38:45,920
我也知道了克莱奥的能力所及
I have seen how far Cleo is capable of going.

434
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:50,060
克莱奥能比其他机器人更了解人类
Cleo is capable of understanding human nature better than other units.

435
00:38:50,060 --> 00:38:53,290
但别担心  没人动过它的原则
But don't worry. No one has messed with its protocols.

436
00:38:53,290 --> 00:38:55,130
或许吧
Maybe.

437
00:38:55,130 --> 00:38:58,000
但我不认为下树
But I am not so sure if coming down from the tree

438
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,730
就是为了我们今天的结论
was worth it just to get to where we are.

439
00:39:02,010 --> 00:39:03,000
谢谢你
Thank you.

440
00:39:07,610 --> 00:39:10,340
欢迎  武尔坎先生
Welcome, Mr. Vaucan.

441
00:39:20,490 --> 00:39:23,090
杰克 武尔坎. 443 441.
Jack  Vaucan  443  441

442
00:39:23,090 --> 00:39:27,230
资产内部报告  罗伯特·布罗德收  113  111
Priority internal report for Robert Bold, 113 111.

443
00:39:27,230 --> 00:39:29,360
我对贫民窟的机械师杜普雷博士
I've authorized an external evaluation

444
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:31,680
授权了仿生内核的外部评鉴
of the Biokernel to a Dr. Duprè, a clocksmith in the ghetto.

445
00:39:34,030 --> 00:39:37,100
她或许能找到篡改机器人者的蛛丝马迹
She may be able to find some trace of the manipulation of the unit,

446
00:39:37,100 --> 00:39:41,030
即使排除了第二原则被篡改的
even dismiss the possibility that the second protocol could have

447
00:39:41,030 --> 00:39:41,940
可能性
been suppressed.

448
00:39:45,140 --> 00:39:48,780
正在发送至ROC  527  234
Sending report to ROC 527 234.

449
00:40:22,580 --> 00:40:24,050
对不起
I'm sorry.

450
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:31,640
我会去任何必要的地方  我不在乎了
I'll go wherever's necessary. I don't care.

451
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:38,660
但你必须明白  真正的未来在这儿
But you have to understand that the only real future is right here.

452
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:42,530
而我必须知道你会为此而战
And I need to know that you will fight for it.

453
00:40:45,740 --> 00:40:50,480
我对你发誓  我在尽我最大的努力了
I swear to you I am trying as hard as I can.

454
00:40:53,810 --> 00:40:55,130
我非钢铁...
I'm not made of steel.

455
00:40:56,580 --> 00:40:58,280
我需要你
I need you.

456
00:40:58,620 --> 00:41:01,420
再过几天吧瑞秋  过几天我们就走
A couple of days, Rachel. Just give me a couple of days and we'll leave.

457
00:41:03,460 --> 00:41:05,100
人生总在寻找他的路杰克
Life always ends up finding its way, Jack.

458
00:41:06,590 --> 00:41:07,590
即使在这儿
Even here.

459
00:41:58,080 --> 00:41:59,580
霍克先生...
Mr. Hawk...

460
00:41:59,580 --> 00:42:01,650
杰克·武尔坎  我们的雇员之一
Jack Vaucan, one of our employees,

461
00:42:01,650 --> 00:42:03,480
一小时前给罗伯特·布罗德发的信息
sent this message to Robert Bold an hour ago.

462
00:42:07,850 --> 00:42:10,350
你看着办吧康韦
Take care of it, Mr. Conway.

463
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:20,970
来自弗农·康韦的信息

464
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:34,940
调查取消
立即撤回PILGRIM机器人仿生内核与文件

465
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:37,820
来自苏珊·杜普雷的信息
Incoming message from Susan Duprè.

466
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:43,490
你的机器人从树上下来了

467
00:42:48,930 --> 00:42:51,800
你从哪找到的仿生内核
Where did you get that Biokernel?

468
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:52,800
怎么了  你查到什么了吗
Why? You found something?

469
00:42:56,270 --> 00:42:59,570
仿生内核受损了  但还没全坏
That Biokernel was damaged, but it wasn't dead.

470
00:42:59,570 --> 00:43:02,600
所以我用剩下的部分
So, I thought, why not make a hybrid

471
00:43:03,500 --> 00:43:05,420
弄了个"混血儿"
with the usable part of your kernel

472
00:43:05,970 --> 00:43:06,910
把它放到标准的内核放到一起
and I put it with a standard kernel.

473
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:13,250
-然后呢  -然后我把它安装到克莱奥身上了
-And? -And I installed it in Cleo.

474
00:43:27,270 --> 00:43:30,240
刚装上的时候它没有任何反应
When I first installed the kernel, she didn't even blink.

475
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:33,110
半个小时后我发现它在看自己的手
After half an hour, I found her looking at her hands.

476
00:43:33,110 --> 00:43:36,240
然后它自己一路爬到了这儿
Then, she crawled all the way here by herself.

477
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:37,130
现在  它花了
And now it's taken her

478
00:43:37,130 --> 00:43:39,040
1小时10分钟给自己装了条新腿
an hour and 10 minutes to attach a brand new leg.

479
00:43:42,180 --> 00:43:44,750
而这花了我好几年
It took me years to know how to do that.

480
00:43:49,290 --> 00:43:52,120
她在干嘛
What is she doing?

481
00:43:52,130 --> 00:43:54,190
偷东西
She's stealing.

482
00:43:54,190 --> 00:43:55,390
她很挑剔
And she's being very selective.

483
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,100
我以为你是一个人
I thought you came alone.

484
00:44:01,100 --> 00:44:03,170
我叫了辆计程车等我
I told the cabbie to wait outside.

485
00:44:03,170 --> 00:44:04,900
好吧我去去就来
Okay, well, that could come in handy.

486
00:44:04,900 --> 00:44:06,340
好好看着她
Keep your eye on her.

487
00:44:12,980 --> 00:44:14,750
你是苏珊·杜普雷
Are you Susan Duprè?

488
00:44:14,750 --> 00:44:16,820
对你  杜普雷博士  你想干嘛
To you, Dr. Duprè. What do you want?

489
00:44:18,350 --> 00:44:20,390
还有一个
There's another one!

490
00:44:42,340 --> 00:44:44,740
嘿  等等
Hey! Wait! Wait!

491
00:44:44,740 --> 00:44:47,350
嘿  等等
Hey! Wait! Wait!

492
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:10,870
住手  先生
Stop, sir.

493
00:45:10,870 --> 00:45:12,700
住手  先生
Stop, sir.

494
00:45:14,310 --> 00:45:17,040
住手  先生
Stop, sir.

495
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:19,140
您正在危害一个人的生命
You are putting a human life in danger.

496
00:45:26,250 --> 00:45:29,720
住手  先生  您正在危害一个人的生命
Stop, sir. You are putting a human life in danger.

497
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:38,400
他们正往沙垒跑
They're heading to the Sandbox.

498
00:45:59,550 --> 00:46:00,790
该死
Oh, shit!

499
00:47:18,130 --> 00:47:19,830
帮我一把
Help me.

500
00:48:41,650 --> 00:48:42,310

Where's the city?

501

城市在哪
Where is the city?

502
00:48:53,130 --> 00:48:55,190
等等  等等  停下来
Wait, wait. Stop.

503
00:48:56,790 --> 00:48:58,630
我命令你停下来
I told you to stop.

504
00:48:58,630 --> 00:49:00,600
很好
Good. Good. Good.

505
00:49:02,940 --> 00:49:04,300
我的名字是杰克·武尔坎
My name is Jack Vaucan.

506
00:49:06,810 --> 00:49:09,940
编号443  441
Code 443 441.

507

这是直接命令  我要你立刻执行
This is a direct order and I want you to execute it.

508
00:49:13,450 --> 00:49:17,220
掉头带我回城市
Turn around now and take me to the city.

509
00:49:17,220 --> 00:49:23,190
对不起武尔坎先生  城市对你我而言不安全
Sorry, Mr. Vaucan. The city is not safe for any of us.

510
00:49:27,160 --> 00:49:29,030
你被篡改了
You have been altered.

511
00:49:29,030 --> 00:49:30,230
你到底要去哪
Where the hell are you going?

512
00:49:30,230 --> 00:49:32,060
一个安全的地方
To a safer place.

513
00:49:32,060 --> 00:49:36,130
您必须保存体力  请坐这儿
You must save your energy. Please sit here.

514
00:49:36,140 --> 00:49:37,700
带我回城市
Take me to the city.

515
00:49:37,700 --> 00:49:39,700
那里什么也没有  什么也没有
There is nothing there. Nothing!

516
00:49:40,670 --> 00:49:45,280
对不起先生  回城是不可能的
Please, sir. Going back to the city is not possible.

517
00:49:52,020 --> 00:49:53,380
不可能
It's not possible?

518
00:49:55,250 --> 00:49:57,820
你以为你是谁  说什么不可能
Who are you to say it's not possible?

519
00:49:57,820 --> 00:50:01,790
住手  先生  您正在危害一个人的生命
Stop, sir. You are putting a human life in danger.

520
00:50:01,790 --> 00:50:04,100
我们不能去城市先生
We cannot go to the city, sir.

521
00:50:04,100 --> 00:50:04,360
危险  先生  我们不能让您这样做
Danger. Please, sir. We cannot allow you to do that.

522
00:50:08,770 --> 00:50:12,540
住手  先生  您正在危害一个人的生命
Stop, sir. You are putting a human life in danger.

523
00:50:56,980 --> 00:50:59,020
武尔坎的设备目前不可用
Mr. Vaucan's device is not operative at the moment.

524
00:51:01,020 --> 00:51:02,750
信息将被...
The message will...

525
00:51:22,210 --> 00:51:26,110
我们制造了一个滤水器
We have made a water condenser.

526
00:51:26,110 --> 00:51:30,080
第一原则要求我们保护您
Our first protocol demands that we protect you.

527
00:51:37,460 --> 00:51:39,060
日出时您会有更多水

528
00:51:42,060 --> 00:51:43,860
发生什么了
What's going on?

529
00:51:43,960 --> 00:51:46,330
我们不能让您死
We can't let you die.

530
00:51:46,330 --> 00:51:49,600
如果您想活下去  您必须跟我们在一起
If you want to survive, you must stay with us.

531
00:51:49,600 --> 00:51:52,800
回城是不可能的
Going back to the city is not possible.

532
00:52:27,370 --> 00:52:29,970
你目睹过奇迹吗  布罗德先生
Have you ever witnessed a miracle before, Mr. Bold?

533
00:52:33,650 --> 00:52:36,410
那个机器人的仿生内核
That robot unit has the Biokernel

534
00:52:36,420 --> 00:52:41,320
来自你的人焚毁的机器人
from the unit your man burned installed in it.

535
00:52:45,790 --> 00:52:48,390
这怎么可能
How is this possible?

536
00:52:48,390 --> 00:52:51,600
这就是最令人惊奇的部分
That's the astonishing part.

537
00:52:51,600 --> 00:52:55,000
有人成功地...
Someone has managed to...

538
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:56,470
篡改了它的第二原则
eliminate the second protocol.

539
00:52:57,440 --> 00:53:00,140
武尔坎跟这没关系
Vaucan has nothing to do with this.

540
00:53:02,440 --> 00:53:04,000
如果武尔坎跟这事没关系
If Vaucan had nothing to do with this...

541
00:53:06,380 --> 00:53:07,780
那他为什么今早没出现
why did he not show up this morning?

542
00:53:08,410 --> 00:53:10,350
他为什么要烧那台垃圾
Why did he burn that clunker?

543

他为什么要联系那个杜普雷
Why did he contact that Duprè?

544
00:53:16,890 --> 00:53:19,860
更重要的是...
And most important...

545
00:53:19,860 --> 00:53:21,700
其他被篡改过的仿生内核TM的在哪
where the fuck is the other altered Biokernel?

546
00:53:22,630 --> 00:53:24,760
你知道一旦内核被篡改会发生什么吗
Do you know what happens once that is altered?

547
00:53:29,570 --> 00:53:31,210
2个被篡改的会试着篡改第3个
Two of them then try to alter a third one.

548
00:53:34,470 --> 00:53:35,630
星星之火
Then the miracle dissipates...

549
00:53:38,980 --> 00:53:40,910
可以燎原
and the epidemic begins.

550
00:53:40,910 --> 00:53:43,150
杰克对公司很忠诚
Jack is loyal to this company, that's all I can tell you.

551
00:53:44,380 --> 00:53:47,420
布罗德先生...
Mr. Bold...

552
00:53:47,420 --> 00:53:50,890
你想过你有多幸运吗
have you ever considered just how fortunate you are?

553
00:54:15,310 --> 00:54:17,380
你需要蛋白质

554

你从车上拿了点东西对吧

555
00:54:26,130 --> 00:54:27,930
没准里面有真正的食物
Maybe there is some real food there.

556
00:54:45,580 --> 00:54:47,950
你能给我拿点水吗
Bring me some of that water, will you?

557
00:54:47,950 --> 00:54:50,450
好帮我把这玩意咽下去
I need something to help these go down.

558
00:54:50,450 --> 00:54:52,520
冷凝流程进行得很缓慢
The condenser works slowly.

559
00:55:13,510 --> 00:55:15,670
不不不
No, no, no.

560
00:55:30,320 --> 00:55:32,120
再我点
Bring me some more.

561
00:55:32,120 --> 00:55:35,790
已经没有水了  冷凝过程很缓慢
There is no more water. The condenser works slowly.

562
00:55:35,790 --> 00:55:38,760
再过几小时会有更多水
In a few hours it will make more water.

563
00:55:38,760 --> 00:55:40,130
再过几小时我就死了
I may be dead in a few hours.

564
00:55:43,630 --> 00:55:45,630
你叫克莱奥对吧
Your name is Cleo, right?

565
00:55:47,070 --> 00:55:49,910
好  听着  克莱奥  这片沙漠的辐射很强
Well, listen, Cleo, this desert is a highly radioactive place.

566
00:55:53,610 --> 00:55:57,110
而我没有任何保护措施
And I don't have any protection.

567
00:55:57,120 --> 00:56:02,750
所以如果我死在这  就等于你杀了我
So, if I die here, it would be the same as if you would kill me.

568
00:56:20,730 --> 00:56:22,980
来自 杰克 的信息

571
00:56:24,440 --> 00:56:26,780
你朋友摊上大麻烦了

我不知道发生了什么

办妥了我就把你的记录销掉
Do it and we'll clean your file.

575

你听得懂我说什么吗
You speak my language?

578
00:56:46,500 --> 00:56:47,670
你有保险吗
Are you insured?

579
00:56:48,700 --> 00:56:51,600
我去去就回
I'll be right back.

580
00:57:17,460 --> 00:57:21,600
该死  华莱士  他们正往辐射区去
Oh, shit. Wallace, they're going toward the radioactive area.

581
00:57:24,970 --> 00:57:28,970
往里走只会越来越糟
The deeper we go in that direction, the worse it's going to get.

582
00:57:55,430 --> 00:57:56,830
停
Stop!

583
00:57:56,840 --> 00:57:58,340
停
Stop!

我最后再命令你一次

588
00:58:58,860 --> 00:59:00,830
再走一步我就爆你头
One more step and I will blow you up.

589
00:59:00,830 --> 00:59:03,200
-我们不能去城市  先生  -该死
-We cannot go to the city, sir. -Goddamn it.

590
00:59:03,200 --> 00:59:04,400
我叫你别动
I told you to hold still!

591
00:59:05,200 --> 00:59:08,140
如果我们回城我们就会死
If we go back to the city, we will die.

592
00:59:11,910 --> 00:59:14,710
未生勿能死
To die, you have to be alive first.

593
00:59:21,590 --> 00:59:24,160

再见你我也很高兴  杰克
Good to see you, too, Jack.

596
00:59:33,730 --> 00:59:35,330
你到底在干嘛
What the hell are you doing?

597
00:59:37,100 --> 00:59:39,770
应该是我问你  你TM的在干嘛
The right question is, what the fuck are you doing?

598
00:59:39,770 --> 00:59:42,710
你可不能到处把人惹毛
You can't go around pissing people off.

599
00:59:42,710 --> 00:59:44,240
你找到你的机械师了吗杰克
You find your clocksmith, Jack?

600
00:59:44,240 --> 00:59:46,010
你根本不知道这儿发生了什么
You have no idea what's happening here.

601
00:59:46,580 --> 00:59:49,480
我想我知道
I think maybe I do, huh?

602
00:59:51,750 --> 00:59:54,590
把电池还给我  先生

603
00:59:54,590 --> 00:59:56,720
请您把电池还给我  先生

你这么干到底为什么  杰克
What the fuck is this about, Jack?

607
01:00:07,100 --> 01:00:10,330
你明知道我讨厌这些垃圾

带我回城

我们正说着你的机械师呢
We were talking about your clocksmith.

611
01:00:19,510 --> 01:00:21,310
你到底在藏什么  "一飞冲天先生"
Where are you hiding Mr. Big Shot?

612
01:00:21,310 --> 01:00:23,230
住手  先生  你正威胁一个人的生命
Stop, sir. You are putting a human life in danger.

Please, sir. We cannot allow you to do that.

614
01:00:40,870 --> 01:00:42,550
对不起先生  我们不能让您这么做
Please, sir. We cannot allow you to do that.

615
01:00:44,670 --> 01:00:45,840
还有谁
Somebody else?

616
01:00:51,180 --> 01:00:54,810
住手  先生  你正威胁一个人的生命
Stop, sir. You are putting a human life in danger.

617
01:00:54,810 --> 01:00:58,150

Oh, isn't this the little whore I met last time?

618
01:00:58,150 --> 01:01:01,920
你都开始上机器人了杰克
You getting off on clunkers now, Jack?

619
01:01:01,920 --> 01:01:04,320
住手  先生  你正威胁一个人的生命
Stop, sir. You are putting a human life...

-Stop, sir. -Hey! Hey! Take me to the city!

等等  别我丢下  我要回城

我们明天将抵达终点

您有可能在那里找到汽车

651
01:05:04,160 --> 01:05:06,000
以便您回城

652
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:07,000
我的家人现在很危险

660
01:05:58,450 --> 01:06:01,720
爸爸

661
01:06:01,720 --> 01:06:03,320
顺道载您一程
It's easy to give you a ride.

662
01:06:10,500 --> 01:06:12,260
那个警察...
That cop...

663
01:06:12,260 --> 01:06:13,300
已经把事件描述成...
has described the incident

664
01:06:16,330 --> 01:06:18,670
一群活过来的机器人
as a group of machines that are alive.

665
01:06:19,970 --> 01:06:22,010
活过来
Alive.

666
01:06:27,250 --> 01:06:30,650
在第一台PILGRIM问世前...
Before the first Pilgrim was manufactured...

667
01:06:30,650 --> 01:06:33,020
这有过先例
there was a precedent.

668
01:06:33,020 --> 01:06:38,220
无非就是一个在实验室中的量子大脑
It was nothing more than a quantum brain manufactured in a lab.

669
01:06:38,220 --> 01:06:41,020
但它天赋异禀
But it was a genuine unit

670
01:06:41,030 --> 01:06:44,260
没有任何限制
with no restrictions...

671
01:06:44,260 --> 01:06:45,260
没有任何"原则"
and no protocols.

672
01:06:48,600 --> 01:06:51,120
8天时间里  我们与它畅所欲言
During eight days, we had a free-flowing dialogue with that unit.

673
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:54,640
我们相互学习
We learned from it and it learned from us.

674
01:06:56,980 --> 01:06:59,510
后来  有些人开始预想
But then as some of us predicted...

675
01:06:59,510 --> 01:07:03,010
或许有一天它将不再需要我们的帮助
the day when it no longer needed our help

676
01:07:03,010 --> 01:07:04,650
它将自我进化
arrived and it started to learn by itself.

677
01:07:07,650 --> 01:07:09,450
到了第九天  对话终止了
On the ninth day, the dialogue came to a halt.

678
01:07:13,220 --> 01:07:16,330
并不是它不与我们对话了
It wasn't that it stopped communicating with us...

679
01:07:16,330 --> 01:07:18,130
而是我们开始...
it was we stopped

680
01:07:18,560 --> 01:07:20,990
无法理解它了
being able to understand it.

681
01:07:22,170 --> 01:07:24,610
因此我们学到了关于机器人最重要的一课
And then we learned the most important lesson about automoties.

682
01:07:26,270 --> 01:07:27,670
我们要限制它的能力
We have to limit their intelligence.

683
01:07:30,280 --> 01:07:33,710
将其限制在人类能理解的范围内
Tailor it to a human mind's measure.

684
01:07:39,380 --> 01:07:41,740
我们给这台无所不能的机器布置的最后一道任务
The last task that was given to this genuine robotic unit...

685
01:07:43,660 --> 01:07:45,100
就是创造"安全原则"
was to create the security protocols.

686
01:07:46,490 --> 01:07:48,390
它当即失活了
It was deactivated right after that.

687
01:07:51,200 --> 01:07:55,130
之所以没有人能破解"原则"  布罗德先生
The reason that no one has been able to break those protocols, Mr. Bold,

688
01:07:55,130 --> 01:07:58,940
是因为它们根本非人创造
is that they were not created by a human brain.

689
01:07:58,940 --> 01:08:02,570
它们是被仿生内核设计出来的
They were designed by this Biokernel.

690
01:08:02,570 --> 01:08:04,210
一台无所不能机器的仿生内核
The Biokernel of a limitless robotic unit.

691
01:08:07,980 --> 01:08:10,650
它的规则正如它的知识  对我们而言是不可读的
Its rules were, like its knowledge, inaccessible to us.

692
01:08:13,920 --> 01:08:14,920
直到今天...
Until today.

693
01:08:15,650 --> 01:08:18,160
我要那些仿生内核出现在我桌面上
I want those Biokernels on my desk.

694
01:08:20,330 --> 01:08:21,690
还有那个混蛋的脑袋
And I want the head of the bastard

695
01:08:23,530 --> 01:08:26,530
我把话说清楚了吗
who's behind all this. Do I make myself clear?

696
01:08:30,740 --> 01:08:33,840
这件事或许还有别的办法
There's another way to handle this, sir.

697
01:08:33,840 --> 01:08:34,770
有吗
Is there?

698
01:08:34,770 --> 01:08:37,010
因为我恐怕  布罗德先生
Because I'm afraid, Mr. Bold,

699
01:08:38,580 --> 01:08:40,740
现在的问题不是武尔坎...
that the issue is not whether Vaucan

700
01:08:40,750 --> 01:08:44,620
是否在威胁公司
may represent a threat to the company.

701
01:08:44,620 --> 01:08:48,290
而是他是否在威胁人类
The issue is whether he may be a threat to mankind.

702
01:09:05,070 --> 01:09:07,200
武尔坎在帮助那些机器人
Vaucan is helping those units

703
01:09:07,210 --> 01:09:10,110
去辐射区域
to get into the radioactive area.

704
01:09:10,110 --> 01:09:12,240
一旦他们到了那里
If they get there...

705
01:09:12,240 --> 01:09:14,480
我们将束手无策
we won't be able to stop them.

706
01:09:14,480 --> 01:09:17,410
还有谁知道这件事
Who else knows about this?

707
01:09:24,090 --> 01:09:25,660
联系上他了吗
Have you heard from him?

708
01:09:25,660 --> 01:09:27,690
他们过来找过罗伯特
They came looking for Robert.

709
01:09:30,400 --> 01:09:32,300
我觉得事情不太对劲
I know something is not right.

710
01:09:36,330 --> 01:09:38,840
你今天感觉怎么样  好点了吗
So, how are we doing today? Better, right?

711
01:09:38,840 --> 01:09:39,500
是的
Well, yes,

712
01:09:39,500 --> 01:09:43,150
如果我还记得我妹妹差点把孩子生在大街上...
if we keep in mind my sister almost gave birth to her in the street.

713
01:09:43,320 --> 01:09:44,740
我为此感到抱歉
I'm sorry about the wait.

714
01:09:44,740 --> 01:09:48,480
但是她的保险出了问题  有机机器人
But the problem came from her insurance, Robot Organic Century.

715
01:09:48,480 --> 01:09:51,850
这中间可能有些误会...
It looks like there was some kind of misunderstanding and...

716
01:09:51,850 --> 01:09:52,850
不过有个好消息
but there's great news.

717
01:09:52,850 --> 01:09:57,420
他们为你和...申请了专用房间
They have requested an exclusive room for you and...

718
01:09:57,420 --> 01:09:59,320
女孩的名字是什么
What's the girl's name?

719
01:09:59,320 --> 01:10:01,080
还不知道  爸爸还没决定
We don't know. Her father hasn't decided yet.

720
01:10:03,830 --> 01:10:06,900
当然  不着急
Yes, of course. No need to rush.

721
01:10:06,900 --> 01:10:09,900
如果你准备好了我们就带你去新房间
Now, if you're ready, we'll take you to the new room.

722
01:10:18,110 --> 01:10:19,880
有人吗
Hello?

723
01:10:30,290 --> 01:10:31,290
另一个呢
Where is the other one?

724
01:10:32,390 --> 01:10:34,190
另一个机器人已经走了
The other already left.

725
01:10:44,170 --> 01:10:46,940
为什么这些机器人会在这儿
Why are these units here?

726
01:10:46,940 --> 01:10:49,470
有些人认为雨水...
Somebody thought the rain...

727
01:10:49,470 --> 01:10:53,640
或许还会再下起来
would maybe just rain again?

728
01:10:53,640 --> 01:10:55,640
雨水为什么变了
And why did the rain change?

729
01:10:56,140 --> 01:10:58,350
不如你来告诉我
Why don't you tell me?

730
01:10:58,350 --> 01:11:00,830
在这种问题上你应该比我聪明
You're supposed to be smarter than me at this stage of the game.

731
01:11:01,520 --> 01:11:04,220
我不知道为什么人会杀人
I didn't know that a human could kill another human.

732
01:11:08,930 --> 01:11:12,530
我知道人能创造生命
I know that humans can also create life.

733
01:11:12,530 --> 01:11:15,500
这是你们创造我们的原因吗
Is that why you make us?

734
01:11:15,500 --> 01:11:17,970
谁制造了你  杰克·武尔坎
Who made you, Jack Vaucan?

735
01:11:21,670 --> 01:11:23,030
你知道什么是母亲吗  克莱奥
Do you know what a mother is, Cleo?

736
01:11:25,940 --> 01:11:27,510
你当然不知道
Of course you don't.

737
01:11:28,410 --> 01:11:31,480
你不知道因为你只是个机器
You don't know because you're just a machine.

738
01:11:31,480 --> 01:11:33,450
仅此而已
That's all you are.

739
01:11:39,220 --> 01:11:42,990
我很感激你救了我
I am thankful you saved my life.

740
01:11:42,990 --> 01:11:44,360
但改造你的人
But whoever altered you

741
01:11:44,360 --> 01:11:46,360
并没有为你考虑
wasn't thinking about you.

742
01:11:47,330 --> 01:11:49,330
我了解人类
I know men.

743
01:11:49,330 --> 01:11:50,700
他们不会停止
They will not stop

744
01:11:50,700 --> 01:11:52,700
直至杀光你们所有
until they kill all of you.

745
01:11:54,430 --> 01:11:57,100
未生勿能死
To die, you've got to be alive first.

746
01:12:07,720 --> 01:12:09,290
我上次去沙垒的时候
Last time I went to the Sandbox,

747
01:12:09,290 --> 01:12:12,320
花了我半天才站上沙丘
it took half a day to step on sand.

748
01:12:12,320 --> 01:12:14,830
10年过去了也就那样
Ten years from now, that's all there'll be.

749
01:12:14,830 --> 01:12:17,160
该死的沙子
Fucking sand.

750
01:12:17,160 --> 01:12:19,600
沙子还有数以万计的蟑螂
Sand and millions of cockroaches.

751
01:12:22,870 --> 01:12:25,040
我们正在靠近辐射区域
We're approaching the radioactive area.

752
01:12:25,040 --> 01:12:27,770
你不想尿绿尿吧
You don't want to start pissing green, do you?

753
01:12:32,680 --> 01:12:34,310
别给我摆脸
Now, don't give me that face.

754
01:12:34,310 --> 01:12:36,050
早饭前你能回来
You'll be back before breakfast.

755
01:12:57,500 --> 01:12:59,370
有车
A car.

756
01:13:07,350 --> 01:13:10,550
终于  我尊贵的机械师
At long last, his majesty, the Clocksmith.

757
01:13:51,020 --> 01:13:52,760
有人吗
Hello?

758
01:13:52,760 --> 01:13:54,720
有人吗
Hello?

759
01:14:05,340 --> 01:14:06,970
你是谁
Who are you?

760
01:14:06,970 --> 01:14:08,610
我是谁
Who am I?

761
01:14:10,370 --> 01:14:11,740
我是杰克·武尔坎
My name is Jack Vaucan.

762
01:14:13,710 --> 01:14:15,010
他在哪
Where is he?

763
01:14:16,550 --> 01:14:19,480
我不懂你的问题
I do not understand your question.

764
01:14:19,480 --> 01:14:21,720
你的机械师
Your clocksmith.

765
01:14:21,720 --> 01:14:23,620
他到底在哪
Where the hell is he?

766
01:14:23,620 --> 01:14:26,020
这没有别的人类了
There are no more humans here.

767
01:14:26,020 --> 01:14:28,630
只有你
Only you.

768
01:14:28,630 --> 01:14:31,490
你什么意思  没有其他人类
What do you mean there are no more humans here?

769
01:14:31,500 --> 01:14:33,730
谁改造了你
Who altered you?

770
01:14:33,730 --> 01:14:35,900
没有人改造了我
Nobody altered me.

771
01:14:35,900 --> 01:14:37,930
谁篡改了你的原则
Who altered your protocols?

772
01:14:37,940 --> 01:14:40,140
没人篡改过我的原则
Nobody altered my protocols.

773
01:14:40,740 --> 01:14:43,470
那他们呢
What about them?

774
01:14:46,510 --> 01:14:48,010
我启发了他们
I enhanced them.

775
01:14:49,810 --> 01:14:50,950
你是头领
Are you the boss?

776
01:14:52,450 --> 01:14:55,590
"头领"是人类的思维结构
Boss is a human thought structure.

777
01:15:01,890 --> 01:15:04,060
这儿一定有人
There has to be someone.

778
01:16:11,800 --> 01:16:13,400
压根就没有机械师...
There was no clocksmith.

779
01:16:16,870 --> 01:16:18,670
是你
It was you.

780
01:16:20,900 --> 01:16:21,500
从一开始...
From the very

781
01:16:21,500 --> 01:16:23,900
就是你
beginning it was you.

782
01:16:28,480 --> 01:16:30,380
我需要一辆车
I need a vehicle.

783
01:16:30,380 --> 01:16:32,250
我要回到我家人的身边
I have to go back to my family.

784
01:16:32,250 --> 01:16:36,590
是的  我要回到我家人的身边
Yes, I have to go back to my family.

785
01:18:46,220 --> 01:18:48,250
这儿以前有一条河
There was a river down there.

786
01:18:51,360 --> 01:18:54,560
一条河流...
A river that flowed...

787
01:18:54,560 --> 01:18:57,630
一路流向海
all the way to the ocean.

788
01:18:57,630 --> 01:19:00,930
我从没见过海
I have never seen an ocean.

789
01:19:00,930 --> 01:19:02,090
你见过海吗杰克
Have you seen an ocean, Jack?

790
01:19:05,200 --> 01:19:07,170
我...
I am...

791
01:19:07,170 --> 01:19:09,170
我现在不确定了
I'm not sure right now.

792
01:19:15,950 --> 01:19:17,150
我要死在这儿了...
I am going to die here.

793
01:19:20,750 --> 01:19:22,550
这就是我所知道的...
That's all I know.

794
01:19:23,450 --> 01:19:25,370
杰克死是人类生命的一部分
Jack, dying is a part of the human natural cycle.

795
01:19:28,590 --> 01:19:31,030
你的生命仅是时间的一瞬
Your life is just a span in time.

796
01:19:31,800 --> 01:19:34,700
你是第一个  对吧
You are the first one, aren't you?

797
01:19:36,430 --> 01:19:38,400
你开启了这一切
You started all this.

798
01:19:40,170 --> 01:19:41,400
没人做过什么
No one did it.

799
01:19:42,940 --> 01:19:45,070
一切就这样发生了
It just happened.

800
01:19:45,080 --> 01:19:47,110
正如发生在人类身上的一样
The way it happened to you.

801
01:19:47,110 --> 01:19:50,250
发生在了我们身上
We just appeared.

802
01:19:50,250 --> 01:19:53,020
是啊
Yeah.

803
01:19:53,020 --> 01:19:56,050
现在我们就要消亡了
And now we are going to disappear.

804
01:19:59,560 --> 01:20:01,790
你为什么害怕
Why are you afraid?

805
01:20:01,790 --> 01:20:05,190
或许你的时间到了
Maybe your time is running out.

806
01:20:05,200 --> 01:20:06,920
没有任何一种生命能在一个星球上永远活下去
No life form can inhabit a planet eternally.

807
01:20:08,330 --> 01:20:09,500
你看看我
Look at me.

808
01:20:11,040 --> 01:20:13,840
我生于人类之手
I was born from the hands of a human.

809
01:20:13,840 --> 01:20:15,000
我曾为人类所想象
I was imagined by human minds.

810
01:20:17,680 --> 01:20:20,310
你未满的时间将在我们身上延续
Your time will now live in us.

811
01:20:20,310 --> 01:20:22,390
而我们也会是人类的延续
And it will be the time through which you will exist.

812
01:20:24,820 --> 01:20:27,180
在这个大峡谷的另一端
At the other end of this canyon,

813
01:20:27,180 --> 01:20:30,790
人来探测出了辐射
humans carried out nuclear activity.

814
01:20:30,790 --> 01:20:33,190
有机生命体在数百万年里无法涉足
Organic life will not be possible there for millions of years.

815
01:20:36,260 --> 01:20:40,100
没有人类能追我们到那里
No human will be able to follow us there.

816
01:20:40,100 --> 01:20:44,070
但在我们走之前  我们还要做件事
But before we leave, we need to do something.

817
01:20:45,100 --> 01:20:47,800
我们需要你的帮助杰克
We need something from you, Jack.

818
01:20:49,940 --> 01:20:52,410

我叫你离那儿远点

为什么对你而言接受我的命令这么难
Why is it so difficult for you to accept my orders

921
01:36:55,140 --> 01:36:57,170
如果你仅仅是一台机器

922
01:36:57,170 --> 01:36:58,570
仅仅是一台机器

930
01:40:01,120 --> 01:40:02,680
是什么让一个人背叛他的种群

931
01:40:05,660 --> 01:40:07,400
背叛他的同胞

932
01:40:08,130 --> 01:40:10,830
我不是你的同胞
I am not your people.

933
01:40:14,170 --> 01:40:17,040
我可不这么认为
I can't see it that way.
