嗨，我是彼得·托兰，欢迎来到“托兰大世界”
Hi, I'm Peter Toland,welcome to "Toland's World".

17
00:07:10,514 --> 00:07:13,225
这周我们来到诺丁汉郡的“发霉山谷”
This week we're in Elderberry Vale in Nottinghamshire, 

18
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:16,270
一个正在蓬勃发展的传统英国乡村
a thriving stretch of classic English countryside, 

19
00:07:16,478 --> 00:07:19,022
确切来说是无数土生土长动植物的家园
home to literally thousands of indigenous plants and animals, 

20
00:07:19,231 --> 00:07:21,900
比如有已逾400年的猪獾洞穴
including a 400-year-old badger sett, 

21
00:07:22,192 --> 00:07:25,112
它们世代以来把这个山丘都挖成筛子了
which has crisscrossed this hill for untold generations.

22
00:07:25,404 --> 00:07:27,990
但是近两年来猪獾都绝迹了，因为。。。
But in the last two years, the badgers have disappeared because 

23
00:07:28,282 --> 00:07:33,036
一个暗影降临了山丘，它是这么个模样的。。。
a shadow has fallen across this hill,a shadow in the form of this...

24
00:07:38,709 --> 00:07:41,420
摄像头能挪开了吗？喂？
Are you gonna pan off me?Hello?

25
00:07:41,587 --> 00:07:42,838
能把镜头对准发电站吗？要么。。。
Are you going to pan to the power station? Or...

26
00:07:43,046 --> 00:07:44,464
行了，卡！彼得，我们得剪掉这段
Yeah OK, cut!Sorry, Peter we gotta cut there.

27
00:07:44,673 --> 00:07:46,592
不，不，别剪，别剪
No-no, don't cut.Do not cut.

28
00:07:46,758 --> 00:07:48,051
怎么了？
What's happening?

29
00:07:48,218 --> 00:07:50,387
抱歉，之前我们失焦了几次所以...
Sorry, we lost focus a few times earlier so...

30
00:07:50,554 --> 00:07:52,431
嗯？我们失焦还是你失焦了？
Yeah? We lost focus or you,you lost focus?

31
00:07:52,598 --> 00:07:55,017
我...再来一次我能做好的，彼得
I... I could... I could do with another crack at that, Peter.

32
00:07:55,058 --> 00:07:56,059
-抱歉
-Sorry, yes.
-你能做好？再来一次
-Could you? Another crack.

33
00:07:56,268 --> 00:07:57,269
嗯，这是怎么回事？
Well, what's going on?

34
00:07:57,394 --> 00:07:58,395
你对焦失败了，这才是关键所在
You lost focus.That's the whole point.

35
00:07:58,604 --> 00:08:00,147
你就是干这一行的，对吗，布莱恩？
That's your job, isn't it, Brian?

36
00:08:00,355 --> 00:08:01,398
我们没想到
We just didn't realize 

37
00:08:01,565 --> 00:08:03,275
你来回走动那么频繁所以...
you were going to move around so much so...

38
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:05,319
我当然要来回走动，我选择，我喜欢
Of course I move around,that's my style.

39
00:08:05,527 --> 00:08:07,779
有些幅度实在太大了
There were some quite large movements.

40
00:08:07,988 --> 00:08:09,698
我们送你根香肠尝尝，彼得，如果这...
We could whack down a sausage for you, Peter, if that's...

41
00:08:09,948 --> 00:08:12,492
我不吃什么狗屁香肠，自己拿去用吧
I don't want a sausage.Shove it up your ass!

42
00:08:13,535 --> 00:08:15,454
不...你瞧，我是说，也许...
No... Look, all I meant was,maybe there's...

43
00:08:15,704 --> 00:08:18,123
不，阁下，让我来给你一些人生经验，如何？
No, look, Don, let me explain how this works, OK?

44
00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:19,291
我叫约翰
It's John.

45
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:21,835
随你叫什么，我要来回走，你跟着我拍
Whatever your name is.I move around, you follow me.

46
00:08:22,044 --> 00:08:24,588
这就是“托兰大世界”的风格，如同翩翩起舞
That's the way it works on Toland's World, it's like a dance.

47
00:08:25,589 --> 00:08:27,090
- 懂否？
- OK?
- 嗯，明白了
- Yeah I get it.

48
00:08:27,299 --> 00:08:29,468
那我们应该剪掉重来还是...
So should we cut now and go again, or...

49
00:08:29,676 --> 00:08:33,138
不...不，我说卡你再停，这是规矩
No... no, I say cut,that's how it works on the show.

50
00:08:33,305 --> 00:08:35,974
明白了吗？除非我说卡，不然一直拍
OK? I call cut and until then we keep filming.

51
00:08:36,266 --> 00:08:38,519
明白了吗？嗯，这就是规矩
You got that?Right, that's how we roll.

52
00:08:38,769 --> 00:08:41,688
- 行吗？好
- Alright? Good.
- 妥，欧了
- OK, yeah.

53
00:08:41,897 --> 00:08:43,357
真是杠王
Prick.

54
00:08:44,691 --> 00:08:47,319
听着，老实说不要发愁
Look, honestly,don't worry about it.

55
00:08:47,611 --> 00:08:49,112
这就是个沙文主义秀
It's just a little alpha male display 

56
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:51,657
都会过去的，我保证
and it'll all blow over,I swear to you.

57
00:08:52,699 --> 00:08:54,701
你瞧，他知道你和阿滕伯勒共事，对吧？
Look, he knows you worked with Attenborough, right?

58
00:08:54,743 --> 00:08:56,703
所以他觉得，觉得地位有点受威胁
So he just feels,he just feels a bit threatened.

59
00:08:56,912 --> 00:09:00,707
哦，对，都是为了银豹奖
Oh, right, it's all about the Silver Leopard Awards.

60
00:09:00,999 --> 00:09:03,752
嗯，他有点杠人，你干的不错
Yeah, he's a bit raw.Well done though.

61
00:09:03,961 --> 00:09:05,087
干的漂亮，真的漂亮
Good work. Really good work.

62
00:09:05,254 --> 00:09:07,297
- 嗯，庆祝一下
- Yeah, cheers.
- 那么，他认为他应该..
- What, so does he think he should 

63
00:09:07,381 --> 00:09:09,633
-获得奖杯还是...？
-他被提名了三次了
-have won them or...?
-He's been nominated three times, 

64
00:09:09,758 --> 00:09:11,844
眼下他认为阿滕伯勒在拆他的台
and now he thinks Attenborough's rigging it.

65
00:09:13,679 --> 00:09:15,347
我明白了，明白了
I know, I know.

66
00:09:15,472 --> 00:09:18,267
那是什么？
What was that?

67
00:09:18,559 --> 00:09:20,561
别说话，让我听听，嘘
Hang on, let me listen,let me listen, hang on.

68
00:09:33,699 --> 00:09:35,576
贪婪的小动物
Greedy little buggers.

69
00:09:35,826 --> 00:09:36,827
瓦屋
Whoa.

70
00:09:38,662 --> 00:09:40,914
你还是...你搞明白没，布莱恩？
You still...You getting this, Brian?

71
00:09:42,708 --> 00:09:45,335
嗯...是猪獾
Yeah... the badgers.

72
00:09:45,586 --> 00:09:47,337
有意思吧？有意思
Having fun are we? Big fun.

73
00:09:47,504 --> 00:09:49,423
玩耍时间，带我玩耍带我飞
Fun times. Clue me in.Let's have a laugh.

74
00:09:49,673 --> 00:09:51,884
- 彼得，这里还有猪獾
- Peter, the badgers are still here.
- 依然獾特猪
- The badgers are still...

75
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:54,970
不，由于发电站的毒气，猪獾都死了
No, the badgers are dead because of the toxins from the power station.

76
00:09:55,179 --> 00:09:56,555
刚刚只是一段小插曲
That's what the episode is about.

77
00:09:56,722 --> 00:09:58,473
- 你瞧，我们把这放进...
- Look, we put the...
- 放进什么？
- Put what?

78
00:09:58,599 --> 00:10:00,642
我认为拍摄不能再继续下去了
I don't think we should carry on filming.

79
00:10:00,851 --> 00:10:03,896
你听着，你算老几？你最后才闲庭信步地走过来
Listen, you. Who are you anyway? You waltz in here at the last minute, 

80
00:10:04,062 --> 00:10:06,607
-发号施令
-我可没有闲庭信步，你...
-calling the shots.
-I didn't waltz in anywhere. You...

81
00:10:06,815 --> 00:10:08,525
我不想再听你扯淡了，行吗？
I don't want to hear any more from you, OK?

82
00:10:08,692 --> 00:10:10,402
但是听着，彼得
But listen, Peter.

83
00:10:10,611 --> 00:10:12,446
能听懂人话吗？
Can you hear me?

84
00:10:12,738 --> 00:10:14,072
我意思是你来真的？
I mean is this for real?

85
00:10:14,281 --> 00:10:16,325
当然来真的，还得更真一点
Of course it's real,and it's gonna get more real, 

86
00:10:16,491 --> 00:10:17,910
因为马上就有人要挨揍了
because someone's gonna get punched in a minute.

87
00:10:18,076 --> 00:10:19,286
你看
Look, please.

88
00:10:19,494 --> 00:10:21,121
听着彼得，我只是想提供帮助
Listen Peter,I'm just trying to help.

89
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:23,790
我不再想听你说任何废话
I do not wanna hear one more word from you.

90
00:10:26,752 --> 00:10:28,378
我不说话难道还发短信？
Shall I text you? Or...?

91
00:10:28,837 --> 00:10:30,339
哦，噢
Oh. Ow.

92
00:10:30,631 --> 00:10:32,424
我不想站在这，拉我一下
Well don't just stand there.Give me a hand.

93
00:10:32,591 --> 00:10:35,928

All local matters are dealt with internally.

110

你懂的，这事关法律

111
00:11:59,178 --> 00:12:01,722
你们不要越级办事！

被告：宫崎华奈

386
00:59:05,337 --> 00:59:08,173
在最近爆发的“活死综合症”期间

437
00:59:09,170 --> 00:59:13,589
被控与多宗故意谋杀罪有关

438
00:59:13,590 --> 00:59:14,679
谋杀？

439
00:59:14,680 --> 00:59:16,009
等，等一下

440
00:59:16,010 --> 00:59:20,259
在2018年，当你女儿麻衣感染“活死综合症”时

441
00:59:20,260 --> 00:59:24,099
你枪杀了她

442
00:59:24,100 --> 00:59:28,729
然而这些谋杀均由可以恢复感染者的

443
00:59:28,730 --> 00:59:30,819
新型药物"Z-cu"作出证据提供

444
00:59:30,820 --> 00:59:33,740
但这种药物根本就没有研发出来啊

445
00:59:34,440 --> 00:59:36,699
起诉方请求对被告执行死刑

446
00:59:36,700 --> 00:59:39,619
但他们想要吃我啊！

447
00:59:39,620 --> 00:59:41,079
我这是正当防卫啊！

448
00:59:41,080 --> 00:59:43,619
那么你认罪吗？

449
00:59:43,620 --> 00:59:45,159
没，没有

450
00:59:45,160 --> 00:59:47,749
阿诺。。。我是你的法庭指派辩护律师

451
00:59:47,750 --> 00:59:52,210
在这种情况下，你最好保持安静...

452
01:00:11,320 --> 01:00:12,860
这就是"Z-cu"疫苗

453
01:00:18,200 --> 01:00:21,370
田中先生，请问是谁杀了您？

454
01:00:23,390 --> 01:00:24,970
啥？啥？啊！！！

455
01:00:34,230 --> 01:00:36,239
正如在座各位所见

456
01:00:36,240 --> 01:00:38,069
毫无疑问

457
01:00:38,070 --> 01:00:39,510
被告有罪！

458
01:00:41,200 --> 01:00:42,840
可我从来没见过这个脑袋啊！

459
01:00:44,620 --> 01:00:45,620
等等

460
01:00:45,621 --> 01:00:47,409
对于你们人类所犯下的罪行

461
01:00:47,410 --> 01:00:50,329
在场所有人都是被害者

462
01:00:50,330 --> 01:00:53,999
但我没有杀害你们中的任何一个啊！

463
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:56,090
你觉得这有差别吗？

464
01:00:59,300 --> 01:01:02,100
你们人类对我们所做的一切，我们都铭记于心！

465
01:01:17,900 --> 01:01:18,900
站住！

466
01:01:20,200 --> 01:01:21,200
让我走...

467
01:01:35,590 --> 01:01:36,670
麻衣...

468
01:01:39,720 --> 01:01:41,260
你还活着？

469
01:01:41,970 --> 01:01:45,100
太好了！佛祖保佑！

470
01:01:48,350 --> 01:01:49,730
麻衣？

471
01:01:50,770 --> 01:01:54,150
法官大人，请容我传唤第二目击证人

472
01:01:57,400 --> 01:02:00,199
你支持被告所说的

473
01:02:00,200 --> 01:02:03,450
“那些谋杀属于正当防卫”的言论吗？

474
01:02:04,330 --> 01:02:05,330
是的

475
01:02:05,331 --> 01:02:06,580

但是。。。

大多数情况下，她享受杀戮他们的快感

478
01:02:13,170 --> 01:02:16,420
麻衣。。。你在说什么？

479
01:02:18,250 --> 01:02:20,130
死刑！

480
01:02:20,550 --> 01:02:22,010
无异议！

481

01:02:51,960 --> 01:02:55,380
杀了你们！杀了你们！杀了你们！

501
01:09:19,840 --> 01:09:23,340
很好，附加题
Alright.One more question.

502
01:09:23,940 --> 01:09:25,259
判断题，过山车限高
True or false. A roller-coaster has a minimum rider 

503
01:09:25,267 --> 01:09:27,639
4尺
height of four feet tall.

504
01:09:27,680 --> 01:09:29,659
约翰尼身高是三尺六寸
Johnny is three feet six inches tall

505
01:09:29,660 --> 01:09:31,639
吉米身高是四尺六寸
and Jimmy is four feet six inches tall.

506
01:09:31,660 --> 01:09:33,728
杰克比约翰高但是比吉米矮
Jackie is taller than Johnny and shorter than Jimmy.

507
01:09:33,740 --> 01:09:35,820
杰克可以坐过山车
Jackie can ride the roller coaster.

508
01:09:39,020 --> 01:09:42,279
-对还是错
-True or false.
-杰克可以坐过山车？
-Jackie can ride the roller-coaster.

509
01:09:43,830 --> 01:09:45,910
比吉米高？
She's taller than Jimmy?

510
01:09:47,740 --> 01:09:51,180
比吉米矮，比约翰尼高
Shorter than Jimmy.Taller than Johnny.

511
01:09:55,360 --> 01:09:58,659
好吧，只能是对是错，是吗？
OK, so all these have to be true-false, right?

512
01:09:58,660 --> 01:10:01,180
刚才说过了是“判断题”
This question reads, "true-false".

513
01:10:01,700 --> 01:10:04,739
好吧，我可以说没有答案吗
OK.Can I say, "unanswerable", 

514
01:10:04,767 --> 01:10:09,043
或者说这是道脑筋急转弯，是不是这样？
or "trick question",or something like that?

515
01:10:09,740 --> 01:10:10,979
这是什么推理？
Under what reasoning?

516
01:10:15,820 --> 01:10:20,959
因为我们不知道杰克到底比约翰尼高多少
Well, you don't know how much taller.

517
01:10:20,964 --> 01:10:22,674
可以是一寸
Like it could be, y'know, an inch.

518
01:10:22,867 --> 01:10:24,369
也可以是两尺
It could be two feet.

519
01:10:24,567 --> 01:10:26,444
根本没有衡量标准
I'm like looking at your face for clues.

520
01:10:26,834 --> 01:10:28,438
没错
That's alright.

我知道了
So yeah, 

522
01:10:29,901 --> 01:10:31,778
最后的答案就是没有答案
my final answer is the question is unanswerable.

523
01:10:31,880 --> 01:10:33,919
非常好，对了

623

……你会照做不误吗？

你知道
You know...

01:21:39,525 --> 01:21:41,860
……有很多女孩子为了得到这个机会什么都干的出来
...a lot of girls would kill for this opportunity.

635
01:21:43,612 --> 01:21:45,572
所以你必须走在她们前面
So you gotta stand above the competition.

636

639
01:21:56,375 --> 01:21:58,085
太阳镜给她
on the day of the shoot.

640
01:21:58,627 --> 01:21:59,962
我们得看看你的形体
We are gonna need to see your body.

641
01:22:00,170 --> 01:22:03,423
不幸的是，制片人们都很挑剔
Unfortunately, producers are kind of picky about that kind of thing.

642
01:22:03,632 --> 01:22:06,677
所以，如果你把那套逗比的裙子脱了，然后……
So if you could just take off that retarded dress that you're wearing...

643
01:22:07,594 --> 01:22:08,762
快点，谢谢

We do not have all day, do we?

645
01:22:28,615 --> 01:22:30,409
嗯……还算凑合吧
Yeah... those're okay.

C减，不能再高
I give 'em a "C-Minus"...

647
01:22:34,705 --> 01:22:37,708
等下，我操，这什么鬼？

你们知道来之前
How many fucking times is this gonna happen before 

651
01:22:46,919 --> 01:22:49,553
要经过多少次的筛选吗！？

不是鸡巴
Not a dick.

不

832

武田先生

833
01:39:04,340 --> 01:39:06,420
还记得我的太郎吗？

834
01:39:06,920 --> 01:39:08,840
我最爱的狗狗

835
01:39:24,440 --> 01:39:27,149
如果当初你好好地照看他

836
01:39:27,150 --> 01:39:29,400
他现在一定还活得好好的

837
01:39:31,700 --> 01:39:33,620
一星期的照看而已

838
01:39:34,870 --> 01:39:37,580
这都不能好好照顾他

839
01:39:37,950 --> 01:39:40,460
太郎在你来之前就已经是我们家庭的一员了

840
01:39:43,840 --> 01:39:47,400
工作工作，你可是在家不用出门的工作啊

842
01:39:49,510 --> 01:39:51,260
可当我回家时

843
01:39:51,340 --> 01:39:53,470
太郎的脚上已经爬满了蛆虫

844
01:39:59,520 --> 01:40:01,890
所有我养的花儿也都枯死了

845
01:40:03,230 --> 01:40:06,230
从此我再也不可能指望你了

846
01:40:06,650 --> 01:40:08,530
也开始憎恶起你的一切

847
01:40:08,730 --> 01:40:09,730
你的气味

848
01:40:09,940 --> 01:40:11,240
所有的一切

849
01:40:12,900 --> 01:40:13,990
都是那么地恶心

850
01:40:14,030 --> 01:40:15,430
你甚至连牙都不刷

851
01:40:15,450 --> 01:40:17,200
留着它们还有什么用

852
01:40:20,370 --> 01:40:22,120
没有吉他的才能

853
01:40:22,410 --> 01:40:24,080
所以你选择放弃吉他手的身份

854
01:40:24,290 --> 01:40:25,960
而成为一个老师，多可悲！

855
01:40:49,150 --> 01:40:50,900
你不是说要出门的么？

856
01:40:51,530 --> 01:40:53,371
哈鸭库，顺便帮我买些卸妆水

857
01:41:02,620 --> 01:41:03,620
妈妈？

858
01:41:04,790 --> 01:41:06,750
还记得学校所担心的

859
01:41:07,500 --> 01:41:10,090
在家的饭食吗？

860
01:41:10,960 --> 01:41:13,670
从来没有蔬菜，因为你不喜欢吃

861
01:41:14,880 --> 01:41:17,299
你从来不烹饪你买来的料理

862
01:41:17,300 --> 01:41:18,930
任由他们坏掉

863
01:41:23,560 --> 01:41:26,310
你女儿的午饭全是垃圾食品

864
01:41:34,400 --> 01:41:35,820
油腻腻的

865
01:41:35,950 --> 01:41:37,910
屋子从来不打扫

866
01:41:41,740 --> 01:41:42,870
欲求不满

867
01:41:43,040 --> 01:41:46,540
武田先生的性冷淡令你永远那么饥渴

868
01:41:47,080 --> 01:41:48,080
走开！

869
01:41:48,710 --> 01:41:50,880
一直把欲求不满带来的焦躁发泄在我头上

870
01:41:50,960 --> 01:41:52,130
适可而止吧！

871
01:41:54,960 --> 01:41:57,840
我最为耿耿于怀的是：

872
01:41:58,890 --> 01:42:01,050
你对我的皮疹漠不关心

873
01:42:02,350 --> 01:42:04,100
难耐瘙痒的我用力挠着

874
01:42:04,890 --> 01:42:06,640
以至于那些疤痕伴随我至今

875
01:42:08,190 --> 01:42:11,150
你甚至记不得我对鸡蛋过敏

876
01:42:12,190 --> 01:42:13,899
没能力抚养一个孩子

877
01:42:13,900 --> 01:42:14,980
那你就别生出来啊！ 

878
01:42:21,370 --> 01:42:25,080
你永远都不会了解我的感受

879
01:42:26,290 --> 01:42:28,870
被夹在中间

880
01:42:29,790 --> 01:42:30,790
美雪

881
01:42:30,791 --> 01:42:32,630
帮我买些烟回来好吗？

882
01:42:32,840 --> 01:42:33,840
到底走不走啊你？

883
01:42:35,630 --> 01:42:37,010
杵在那干嘛？

884
01:42:39,300 --> 01:42:40,640
态度好一点

885
01:42:40,970 --> 01:42:42,760
拜托她帮你带东西的

886
01:42:43,100 --> 01:42:44,640
那你去帮我买啊

887
01:42:44,810 --> 01:42:46,810
哎哟哟，就跟你的吉他亲热呢

888
01:43:15,550 --> 01:43:16,550
不

889

助产士说嚼些这个可以延缓婴儿出生

will slow down the baby until I can get her from town.

不，泰，求你了，我不想一个人呆在这，求你了
Oh Ti, please don't leave.I don't want to be alone, please.

你不会有事的
You'll be fine,

there's years enough root in that jar,

一半都不用吃完

No, it's not sweetie.

你抓到什么了？妈妈？
What did we catch, Mama?

880
01:45:14,220 --> 01:45:16,000
一只老兔子
A mean old bunny rabbit.

881

妈妈，为什么你等着兔子撞到陷阱里来
Mom, why don't you go out and catch the rabbit 

882
01:45:22,740 --> 01:45:24,919
而不是出去抓兔子呢？
instead of waiting for it to get trapped?

883
01:45:24,920 --> 01:45:28,509
我不可能挺着个大肚子到处去抓兔子呀
I can't be running around looking for rabbit with you inside of me.

那你就让我出来嘛
You should let me come out then.

为什么要出来？不想再和妈妈呆着吗？
Why do you want to come out?Don't you like spending time with your mom?

887

不... 不是的
No, it's not that...

888
01:45:37,600 --> 01:45:41,219
我听你的意思好像是想离开这地方丢下妈妈一人
Well, it sounds to me like you wanna leave your mom in this place all by herself.

890
01:45:41,220 --> 01:45:43,220
我不是这个意思
That's not what I meant.

如果连你也走了我真的不知道该怎么活下去
Don't know what I'd do if you left me here all alone.

892
01:45:47,160 --> 01:45:52,139
对不起妈妈，我只是不想总是天天吃一样的东西
I'm sorry Mama,I'm just sick of eating the same
things all the time is all.

894
01:45:52,140 --> 01:45:55,319
等你爸爸回来你就能出来了
Well, you can come out when your dad gets back.

如果你是男孩，他还可以带你去打猎
And if you're a boy, he can take you out when he goes hunting.

896

真希望我是个男孩
I hope I'm a boy.

897

你爸一回来我们就知道了
Well, he'll be back any day now.We'll find out then.

But for now you're just a little baby.

冷静，妈妈，你让我出来吧
Calm down Mama,you gotta let me come out now.

905
01:46:38,200 --> 01:46:40,719
你答应过不会离开我的！
You promised,you said you won't leave.

906
01:46:40,720 --> 01:46:42,709
但我太大了，而且那药让我难受
But I'm too big,and it's hurting me.

907
01:46:42,710 --> 01:46:44,380
你出来！我保证不打死你！
Don't you leave me!

908
01:46:50,120 --> 01:46:51,740
我不会离开你的，妈妈
I won't leave you, Mama.

I don't wanna be alone again.

我不会离开你的，妈妈，我只是需要一些空间，好吗？
I won't leave you, Mama.I just need the room, OK?

914
01:47:30,920 --> 01:47:35,160
别担心，我能处理好的，妈妈，冷静下来
Don't worry, I can fix this Mama,just stay calm.

915
01:48:19,560 --> 01:48:23,120

See, Mama?Now there's room for both of us.

Ti, is that you?

917

我看起来真的和以前那么不一样吗？
Do I really look that different?

你上哪儿去了？
Where have you been?

无可奉告
Don't start.

920

I waited as long as I could,but it didn't sit right.

我只能自己剖腹产了
I had to cut it out myself.

922

那我们只能再试一次了
Then we'll just have to try again.

我不知道我还行不行
