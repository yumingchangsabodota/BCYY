Two weeks? You've barely known me for two weeks.

191
00:18:13,959 --> 00:18:16,862
你这该死的骗子 你就像其他人一样!
You fucking liar, you're just like everyone else!

192
00:18:16,928 --> 00:18:18,797
你为什么要接受我的好友请求?
Why did you accept my friend request?

193
00:18:18,864 --> 00:18:20,966
- 你不用一定要接受的 - 快点放开我啊!
- You didn't have to do that! - Get the fuck off me!

194
00:18:21,032 --> 00:18:22,901
你知道孤独是什么的感觉吗?
Do you have any idea what it feels to be alone?

195
00:18:22,968 --> 00:18:26,204

- Completely alone.. - Get off me, you freak!

196
00:18:40,485 --> 00:18:42,520
罗拉 你没有做错什么
Laura, you didn't do anything wrong.

197
00:18:42,588 --> 00:18:44,756
那女生根本就有问题
This chick is just damaged.

198
00:18:45,824 --> 00:18:47,793
泰勒 你当时不在那里
You weren't there, Tyler.

199

这不是你的错
It's not your fault.

200

亲爱的 我真的很抱歉

但我真的要回去继续解剖死人了
I gotta get back to cutting up dead people.

202
00:18:55,934 --> 00:18:57,202
好吧

203
00:19:01,239 --> 00:19:02,808
她想跟我视像通话 我应该怎么做?
She's tryin' to face-chat me. What do I do?

204
00:19:02,874 --> 00:19:05,911
不要接听! 我说真的!
Don't take the call. Seriously.

205
00:19:05,977 --> 00:19:08,313
好吧 我晚点再跟你说

206
00:19:08,379 --> 00:19:10,315

Hmm.

209
00:22:30,748 --> 00:22:32,117
你还好吗?
Are you okay?

210
00:22:37,355 --> 00:22:39,224
快回去睡觉吧
Go to bed.

211
00:22:58,776 --> 00:23:01,279
下课后我再告诉你整件事...
let me after class to tell you a story..

212
00:23:03,581 --> 00:23:06,117
请安静 各位 请注意
Please. Everyone, please.

213
00:23:12,123 --> 00:23:13,859
很遗憾我有责任要在这里
it's my unfortunate responsibility

214
00:23:13,925 --> 00:23:16,627
告诉大家一个可怕的消息
to share with you some terrible news.

215
00:23:16,694 --> 00:23:19,497
似乎就在上周末我们的同学
It seems that over the weekend your fellow student

216
00:23:19,564 --> 00:23:21,532
玛丽娜·米尔斯自杀了
Marina Mills committed suicide.

217
00:23:33,478 --> 00:23:36,181
你还好吗?
How'd it go?

218
00:23:36,247 --> 00:23:37,348
无事
Fine.

219
00:23:38,850 --> 00:23:40,385
我刚刚跟学校说了她近乎
I just told them she was stalking me.

220
00:23:40,451 --> 00:23:42,287
疯狂地缠绕我的事
Kind of like crazy.

221
00:23:42,353 --> 00:23:45,090
嘿 别将这件事怪责自己
Hey, don't beat yourself up about it.

222
00:23:45,156 --> 00:23:47,425
那个女孩完全是个怪胎
That girl was completely nuts.

223
00:23:47,492 --> 00:23:48,693
她只是需要人帮助去度过
She needed help though.

224
00:23:48,759 --> 00:23:51,129
嗯 非常严重的帮助
Yeah, like serious help.

225
00:23:51,196 --> 00:23:53,965
在二年级时绝不能错过心理学课
Never miss sophomore in psych 201.

226
00:23:54,032 --> 00:23:55,433
向好的一面想
Look on the bright side.

227
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:58,269
也许我们班可以为她举行一个葬礼
might be able to get out of class for the funeral.

228
00:23:58,336 --> 00:24:01,006
不 不 不 没有葬礼 根本没有尸体
No-no-no, there's not gonna be a funeral. There's no body.

229
00:24:01,072 --> 00:24:02,740
你是什么意思?
What do you mean?

230
00:24:02,807 --> 00:24:05,576
呃 警方今天早上来过我的宿舍
Uh, um, cops were at my dorm this morning

231
00:24:05,643 --> 00:24:09,147
他们不知道她在那里自杀 至少不在宿舍里
and, and they don't know where she did it, but it wasn't there.

232
00:24:09,214 --> 00:24:12,683
呃 事实上她自从上周末以来就一直没有用过她的房卡
Uh, actually, she hasn't swiped her keycard since last weekend.

233
00:24:12,750 --> 00:24:15,220
而这点不是最奇怪的地方 最令我感到奇怪的是
and that's not what freaks me out, what freaks me out

234
00:24:15,286 --> 00:24:18,289
警方根本不知道这个女孩的背景
is that they don't know who this girl even was.

235
00:24:18,356 --> 00:24:20,491
她 呃 联络数据 她的社保号码
Her, uh, contact info, her social security

236
00:24:20,558 --> 00:24:23,228
在整个学校的数据库中被删除
it's all been deleted from the school database.

237
00:24:23,294 --> 00:24:25,897
警方连她的名字玛丽娜·米尔斯是否她的真名也不知道
They don't even think that Marina mills was her real name.

238
00:24:27,032 --> 00:24:29,367
呃 你说真的吗?
uh, are you serious?

239
00:25:47,478 --> 00:25:50,081
- 我的天啊 - 怎么了?
- Oh, my god. - What's going on?

240
00:25:52,917 --> 00:25:55,620
为什么你要看这个?
Why are you watching this?

241
00:25:55,686 --> 00:25:58,123
- 是谁传送这鬼东西给你的? - 她
- Who sent you this crap? - She did.

242
00:25:58,189 --> 00:26:00,458
- 她死了 - 我知道
- she's dead. - I know.

243
00:26:23,781 --> 00:26:26,417
好了 你会有六十分钟的时间
Again, you'll have 60 minutes.

244
00:26:26,484 --> 00:26:30,388
这是一个真实的案例研究 一个具有挑战性的
This is an actual case study. A challenging one.

245
00:26:51,209 --> 00:26:52,677
我的天啊
Oh, my god.

246
00:26:58,049 --> 00:27:00,218
天啊
God.

247
00:27:00,285 --> 00:27:01,719
这是那段影片吗?
Is that the video?

248
00:27:01,786 --> 00:27:04,021
我以为你说在你的讯息里 你发布了?
I thought you said it was in your messages. You posted it?

249
00:27:04,089 --> 00:27:06,257
不 不 有人发布了 不是我
No, no, someone did. I didn't.

250
00:27:07,458 --> 00:27:10,461
而且标签了我所有的朋友
And they tagged all my friends.

251
00:27:15,133 --> 00:27:17,402
伍德森小姐 不要使用手提电脑
Laptops away, miss woodson.

252
00:27:19,036 --> 00:27:23,374
为什么他们会以为是我做的 我 我绝对不会这样做的
Why would they think I did that? I would, I would never do that.

253
00:27:23,441 --> 00:27:25,009
你有没有尝试换密码?
Did you try changing your password?

254
00:27:25,076 --> 00:27:27,445
有 有啊 我尝试了一切
Yes, yes, I've tried everything.

255
00:27:32,283 --> 00:27:34,152
她不断会回到我的好友清单中
She's even back in my friend's list.

256
00:27:34,219 --> 00:27:36,354
解除那个死婊子的好友关系
Unfriend that dead bitch.

257
00:27:41,759 --> 00:27:44,195
我解除不了
I can't.

258
00:27:44,262 --> 00:27:45,996
所以伍德森小姐 根据你说的情况
So according to you, miss woodson, this video

259
00:27:46,063 --> 00:27:49,267
这影片今天早上就神奇地出现在你的主页上?
just magically appeared on your timeline this morning?

260
00:27:49,334 --> 00:27:52,437
- 我说得正确吗? - 为什么我要发出去?
- Do I have that right? - Why would I do this?

261
00:27:54,739 --> 00:27:58,776
一定是有某种原因令那个女孩会烧掉你的画像
There must be some reason this girl burned that picture of you.

262
00:27:58,843 --> 00:28:02,413
听着 罗拉 我们知道你是一个好学生
Look, Laura, we know that you're a great student

263
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:05,483
但有很多学生都投诉你骚扰玛丽娜
but multiple students reported you harassing Marina.

264
00:28:05,550 --> 00:28:08,686
不! 她才是那个骚扰我的人
No, she was the one harassing me.

265
00:28:10,755 --> 00:28:12,157
她沉迷着我
She was obsessed with me.

266
00:28:12,223 --> 00:28:13,924
罗拉 没有人说玛丽娜的死
Laura, no one's saying it's your fault

267
00:28:13,991 --> 00:28:15,493
是你的错
that Marina took her life.

268

我连我的账号也无法删除
I can't even delete my account.

276
00:28:38,283 --> 00:28:40,017
就像我说的一样 这里不是客户中心
Like I said, this isn't a call center.

277
00:28:40,084 --> 00:28:43,087
好吧 那为什么我不能解除和一个死去的女孩的好友关系?

I'm afraid they'll just tell you the same thing.

283
00:28:59,737 --> 00:29:01,739
接下来怎么办?

高比 我知道你就在这里 我可以听到你在玩游戏
Kobe, I know you're in there. I can hear your stupid game.

她在自己的手提电脑前点燃自己然后上吊自杀
She burned and hung herself in front of her laptop.

他只是个朋友 你知道的
He's just a friend, you know that.

It's called cyberstalking for a reason.

317
00:31:33,591 --> 00:31:36,361

呃 类似饼干

白白肥肥的孩子很爱朱古力
The white chubby kid who loves chocolate.

325
00:32:16,701 --> 00:32:19,837
宝贝 你不是小孩了 天啊 你真挑剔
Babe, you're not chubby. You're very fussy. My god!

326
00:32:19,904 --> 00:32:21,739

I'm not being fussy, I'm on my period

327
00:32:21,806 --> 00:32:24,341

352
00:37:25,575 --> 00:37:27,912

感觉一切都很虚假

I'm getting a lot of pressure from the students.

377

As long as the posts are up, i have no choice

378
00:41:06,330 --> 00:41:08,598
只好中止你余下的学期 暂时休学
but to suspend you for the rest of the semester.

379
00:41:10,700 --> 00:41:13,303
妈 其实你不需要经常打给我的
Mom, you don't always have to call me on facetime, you know.

380
00:41:13,370 --> 00:41:15,305
- 你为什么不打给我? - 对不起

- Jesus, Kobe, I don't-- - I don't want you to watch it.

有些人将黑蜂与邪恶联系在一起
some people associated them with evil.

395
00:42:07,124 --> 00:42:10,527
他们说黑蜂出现在女巫居住的地方附近

投入她自己的幻想世界中

一些小孩不应该去看的东西

这是我当警察二十五年来
Now I've been on this job 25 years

456
00:54:15,752 --> 00:54:17,887
第一次遇上的事情
and that's a first for me.

457
00:54:17,954 --> 00:54:20,656
是不是有一些我们不知道的低劣新毒品出现了?
There's some shitty new drug we don't know about?

458
00:54:20,724 --> 00:54:22,792
我从来都没有碰过那些东西
I never took anything.

459
00:54:22,859 --> 00:54:25,328
我想知道的是 你是在那里找到那段
What I wanna know is, where you got the elevator footage

460
00:54:25,394 --> 00:54:26,930
升降机影片来发布?

Well, the good news for you is we can't link

463
00:54:36,305 --> 00:54:38,341
没有找到任何和那些影片有关连
your ip address to any of these videos.

464
00:54:38,407 --> 00:54:40,609
事实上我们根本找不到任何网络地址
We couldn't find any address at all

465
00:54:40,676 --> 00:54:42,378
这根本就说不通
which doesn't make any sense.

466
00:54:42,445 --> 00:54:45,281
除非你非常熟悉我们的网络部门

467
00:54:49,652 --> 00:54:51,888
这一切都是那个女孩做的

伍德森小姐 你认识很多死人呢

罗拉 我不认为这是一个自杀行为

我认为这是一种仪式
I think it was a ritual.

472
00:56:56,379 --> 00:56:58,714
呃 这些 你在这里看到的
Um, that, what you're lookin' at here

473
00:56:58,781 --> 00:57:00,616
这些 这些叫作黑镜
these are, these are black mirrors.

474
00:57:00,683 --> 00:57:03,953
他们在千百年前就已经被用作超自然用途
They've been used in the occult for thousands of years.

475
00:57:04,020 --> 00:57:07,356

and they say that if you, if you stare into it

476
00:57:07,423 --> 00:57:11,327
你就可以和另一边沟通
you can communicate with some other sides.

477

这 这叫作占卜
It's, it's, it's called scrying.

478
00:57:14,497 --> 00:57:17,566
但有时这些女巫 如果她们被猎杀
but sometimes these witches, if they were being hunted

479
00:57:17,633 --> 00:57:20,836
而她们没有其他任何方法可以做
if they didn't have any other, any other way out

480
00:57:20,904 --> 00:57:22,505
她们就会站在黑镜前
they would hang and burn themselves

481
00:57:22,571 --> 00:57:25,341
点燃自己然后上吊自杀 之后就变成其他东西
in front of a black mirror and become something else.

482
00:57:25,408 --> 00:57:28,878
你想怎么叫都可以 邪灵

485
00:57:34,650 --> 00:57:36,953
呃 缠绕他们 困扰他们
uh, possessing them and-and haunting them

486
00:57:37,020 --> 00:57:39,488
还有杀死他们
and killing them.

487
00:57:39,555 --> 00:57:42,425
那他们如何阻止?
How'd they ever stop it?

488
00:57:42,491 --> 00:57:45,328
网上说他们要找到那块原本的镜子
It says they had to find the original mirror.

489
00:57:45,394 --> 00:57:48,497
那一块被她们站在面前点燃自己然后上吊的黑镜 把它毁灭
The one they burned themselves in front of, destroy it.

490
00:57:50,166 --> 00:57:53,903
你指是她的手提电脑?
You mean her laptop?

491
00:57:53,970 --> 00:57:56,472
那就是她的黑镜
It was her black mirror.

492
00:57:56,539 --> 00:57:59,208
我们需要找到她究竟在那里进行自杀
We need to find out where she killed herself.

493
00:58:45,388 --> 00:58:48,291
噢 噢 我的天啊!

494
00:59:28,531 --> 00:59:31,667
我想 我想 这里一定隐藏着些什么
I mean, there, there has to be something here.

495
00:59:31,734 --> 00:59:34,237
你明的 一些可以帮到我们的东西

496
00:59:36,205 --> 00:59:38,341
我想我要回家了
I think I'm going home.

497
00:59:40,909 --> 00:59:43,379
我承受不了这些事

502
01:00:46,275 --> 01:00:47,476
为什么每个人都这样说你?
Why is everyone talking about you?

503
01:00:47,543 --> 01:00:50,045
你对那个女孩做了什么?
What have you done to this girl?

504
01:00:50,113 --> 01:00:52,215
我没有对她做过什么!
I haven't done anything to her.

505
01:00:52,281 --> 01:00:55,251
她就一直缠绕着我
She just attached herself to me.

506
01:00:56,819 --> 01:00:58,621
而现在每个人都认为...
And now everyone thinks that..

507
01:00:58,687 --> 01:01:01,257
拜托 宝贝 我想你回家 你跟我回家吧

警方已将嫌疑人扣押

直到他们完成整个调查之前
but they're not releasing any information

513
01:01:13,469 --> 01:01:16,339
他们不会发布任何嫌疑人的信息
until they complete their investigation.

514

Moore's Grove

那是一个废弃的农场镇 约两个小时的路程
it's a deserted farm town about two hours away.

until somebody burnt the whole place down.

520
01:01:32,121 --> 01:01:33,656

他们努力维持着她的性命...

...一直到玛丽娜出生

她自己一个在子宫里度过了数个月
