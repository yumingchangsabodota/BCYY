2
00:00:40,943 --> 00:00:42,789
搞什么？
What the fuck?

3
00:00:44,166 --> 00:00:46,683
等等，我要打电话叫人！
Wait, I gonna call them in!

4
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:50,601
退后！
Move back!

5
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:03,407
为什么要这样做？
Why are you doing this?

6
00:01:09,694 --> 00:01:11,713
去死吧，混蛋！
Take that, motherfucker!

7
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:29,927
拜托
Please.

8
00:01:29,952 --> 00:01:31,818
请停手吧！
Just fucking stop it!

9
00:01:31,843 --> 00:01:33,743
把枪放下
Put your gun down!

10
00:01:36,401 --> 00:01:37,987
我求你了
Come on.

11
00:01:38,916 --> 00:01:40,437
求你了
Please.

12
00:01:40,711 --> 00:01:43,618
我向你求饶了 我没有动过他
I'm fucking begging you. I didn't touch him.

13
00:01:43,643 --> 00:01:45,426
我没动过那个老头
I didn't touch that old man.

14
00:01:45,451 --> 00:01:46,752
我根本……
I wasn't even...

15
00:02:09,703 --> 00:02:14,549
会计刺客
the accountant

16
00:02:14,701 --> 00:02:19,045
星期天入土 这就是所罗门·格兰迪的一生
Buried on Sunday. That was the end Of Solomon Grundy.

17
00:02:19,070 --> 00:02:21,288
所罗门·格兰迪
Solomon Grundy.

18
00:02:25,734 --> 00:02:28,033
不要乱动 Justine
Justine, please.

19
00:02:31,448 --> 00:02:34,668
这叫“刺激行为” 是一种自我刺激
It's called “stimming.” It's self-stimulation

20
00:02:34,837 --> 00:02:38,843
就好像我和你 会敲手指、磨牙
Where as, you and I might tap our fingers, grind our teeth,

21
00:02:38,868 --> 00:02:42,479
或者咬指甲 你儿子变成了前后摇而已
bite our nails. Your son rocks back and forth.

22
00:02:42,504 --> 00:02:45,497
虽然更明显 但绝对是正常行为
It's more obvious, but perfectly natural.

23
00:02:45,522 --> 00:02:49,152
我们来这里 因为我们听说你是这方面的专家
We came here, because we heard you specialized in, in...

24
00:02:49,177 --> 00:02:51,617
什么来着？我们得的病叫？
What is it? What does he have?

25
00:02:51,642 --> 00:02:54,207
我不喜欢给这种状态取名字
Mm, not a fan of labels, ma'am.

26
00:02:54,582 --> 00:02:57,301
你儿子是一位优秀的年轻人
Your son is a remarkable young man.

27
00:02:57,326 --> 00:03:00,259
却在我用吸尘器的时候会发狂
Who goes crazy when you turn the vacuum on.

28
00:03:00,284 --> 00:03:03,573
永远只穿一件T恤 不让你抱他
Wears one Tee-shirt. Won't let you hug him.

29
00:03:03,598 --> 00:03:07,324
噪音、强光 对你儿子这样的人来说
Loud noises, bright lights can be especially difficult

30
00:03:07,349 --> 00:03:08,888
是比较不能接受的
for someone like your son.

31
00:03:08,913 --> 00:03:12,878
T恤的话 很可能是对那种布料有依赖
The shirt, most likely fabric sensitivity.

32
00:03:12,927 --> 00:03:18,615
拥抱、亲密行为、接触 确实可能是个挑战
Hugging, closeness, touching,
that can be a challenge, yes.

33
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:22,656
如果是别人的孩子 那就是挑战
When it's somebody else's child, it's a challenge.

34
00:03:22,681 --> 00:03:26,279
当是你自己的孩子时 那就是问题
When it's yours, it's a problem.

35
00:03:26,707 --> 00:03:29,780
我的工作主要关注的是教育
My practice focuses on education.

36
00:03:29,805 --> 00:03:32,661
我乐意用你儿子的节奏和他待在一起
I like to work with your son at his speed.

37
00:03:32,686 --> 00:03:36,092
帮他发展一些他日后需要用来生活的技能
Help him develop the skills he'll need to live a full life.

38
00:03:36,117 --> 00:03:40,372
让他学会交流、眼神接触和理解人们的非语言指示
Communicating, eye contact,
understanding non-verbal cues;

39
00:03:40,397 --> 00:03:41,770
还有交上朋友
making friends.

40
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:44,683
他唯一的朋友是他弟弟
The only friend he has is his little brother.

41
00:03:45,304 --> 00:03:48,469
我相信只是搬来搬去并没有什么帮助
I'm sure moving from base to base doesn't help it.

42
00:03:49,059 --> 00:03:53,285
我丈夫是军人 也就是说我们都是
My husband's in the Army, which means we all are.

43
00:03:53,914 --> 00:03:57,078
你愿意让你儿子这个暑假和我们待在一起吗？
Would you be willing to let your son stay with us for the summer.

44
00:03:57,103 --> 00:04:00,784
免费的，只是和我一起待在这个友好的环境里
Free of charge, working with me
in a sensory-friendly environment.

45
00:04:00,809 --> 00:04:02,836
不可能的事
That's not gonna happen.

46
00:04:03,417 --> 00:04:07,374
如果他受不了噪音和强光 那他就更需要去适应
If loud noises and bright lights bother him, he needs more of it,

47
00:04:07,399 --> 00:04:09,118
而不是逃避
not less.

48
00:04:09,166 --> 00:04:12,339
真实世界可不是那么友好！
The world is not a sensory-friendly place

49
00:04:12,364 --> 00:04:15,036
那才是他该学习如何生存的地方
and that's where he needs to learn where to live.

50
00:04:16,277 --> 00:04:17,906
不是这里
Not in here.

51
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:20,392
博士 依你所见
Doctor, in your opinion.

52
00:04:20,417 --> 00:04:23,292
我们儿子能过上正常人的生活吗？
Can our son lead a normal life?

53
00:04:23,998 --> 00:04:25,972
要看什么叫正常了
Define normal.

54
00:04:26,571 --> 00:04:28,491
我得完成 我得完成
I need to finish. I need to finish.

55
00:04:28,516 --> 00:04:31,427

我从没想过自己会放弃

我们祖传四代都是农民

但是 在房产税

69
00:05:37,268 --> 00:05:40,594
灌溉设施花销、保险费的夹击下
fertilizer cost, insurance.

70
00:05:43,162 --> 00:05:45,991
我就破产了
Ah, the hell with it.

71
00:05:46,016 --> 00:05:48,562
要打断你一下提醒你
Well...just temporarily remind you,

72
00:05:48,587 --> 00:05:52,182
今年我们的税还是用信用卡交的

73
00:05:57,950 --> 00:06:00,840
你喜欢这个吗？我自己做的
Do you like it? I made it myself.

74
00:06:00,865 --> 00:06:02,866
不 并不是特别喜欢
No, not particularly.

75
00:06:03,505 --> 00:06:04,845
但你卖出去过吗？

76
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:06,508
在教堂集市上卖出去过
At church fairs now and again.

77
00:06:06,533 --> 00:06:09,643
所以Rice先生 你经营着国税局可能认为是“家庭作坊”的产业
Mrs Rice, you may have what the IRS
calls a “a home-based business.”

78
00:06:09,668 --> 00:06:11,916

I don't, really.Just wherever I happen to be, I guess,

80
00:06:14,853 --> 00:06:17,710
可能在电视前 可能在厨房桌子上
in front of the TV, at the kitchen table...

好 但如果你能努力想一下
Yes, it would be better if you could try to remember

83
00:06:22,007 --> 00:06:25,214
有什么固定的地方会更好
the one specific space that you use.

84
00:06:25,239 --> 00:06:27,510
你们家占地29013平方米
Your home is 29,013 square meter.

85
00:06:27,534 --> 00:06:30,478

IRS code allows us to deduct from your taxable income

86
00:06:30,503 --> 00:06:33,330

87
00:06:33,355 --> 00:06:34,870
-什么？ -Rice先生

How big is your dining room, Mrs Rice's office?

89
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:41,371
我不会把那叫做我的工作室…
I wouldn't so much as call it an office...

90
00:06:42,678 --> 00:06:47,119
大概…有两百

Mr. King, you've wandered so far outside your legal purview.

作为南方信托银行的总裁 我想保护我客户的隐私
As the president of Southern Trust Bank, I intend to protect my customer's privacy...

101
00:07:39,789 --> 00:07:43,255

Stop talking. You have a very cavalier attitude for the president of a bank

102
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,131
为了保护那些混蛋就态度如此傲慢

It's not even the best part, look. This part is...

550
00:42:01,129 --> 00:42:03,502

They're routing money to a company that doesn't exist.

我不乱猜

我们吃了你的柠檬蛋白派

572

那有两瓶胰岛素
And those two bottles of insulin.

573
00:43:58,458 --> 00:44:03,598
我觉得我把你当大人看你会比较开心 对吧？
I just thought that you'd appreciate me treating you like an adult, right?

574
00:44:03,623 --> 00:44:05,502
所以我直接讲了
So here's what I got.

575
00:44:10,504 --> 00:44:17,645
你自己打胰岛素发生意外 过量致死
You administer your own accidental insulin overdose, and just die

576
00:44:17,670 --> 00:44:19,588
但是死得还有尊严
but do it with dignity.

577
00:44:19,613 --> 00:44:22,624
你睡在楼上的老婆

579
00:44:27,318 --> 00:44:28,563
对不对？
am I right?

580
00:44:28,588 --> 00:44:30,681
不过她能得到那笔钱的唯一办法 Ed
But the only way she's going to collecting that policy, Ed,

581
00:44:30,706 --> 00:44:33,651
是必须让你的死是一场意外
is that we have the appearance of an accident.

582
00:44:33,660 --> 00:44:37,574
如果我们动手的话 你会反抗 大叫
If we lay hands on you, you're gonna fight, squeal,

583
00:44:37,599 --> 00:44:39,565
吵醒了她 我们也没办法了
she wakes up, my hands are tied.

584
00:44:39,566 --> 00:44:41,877
本来只需要一个人意外死亡的 你想两人一起吗？
One accidental death is just that. Two?

585
00:44:41,888 --> 00:44:46,902
而且 我也只能把这做成一场灭门惨案
No, I'll have no choice but to rock and roll a home invasion,

586
00:44:46,926 --> 00:44:48,751
用无数方法虐待你老婆

587
00:44:48,776 --> 00:44:51,604
杀了你们俩 然后烧了这房子

589
00:44:56,616 --> 00:44:59,648
没人想虐待你老婆 好吗？
Nobody's gonna violate your wife, okay?

590
00:44:59,695 --> 00:45:03,736
况且 其他人肯定会说我不是人的
Besides, what that would say about me as a human being?

591
00:45:03,761 --> 00:45:05,973
生理学来讲 我不想这么做
Physiologically, it's a non-starter.

592
00:45:05,998 --> 00:45:10,837
有的时候我只是喜欢乱喷 乱讲些难听的屎
Sometimes I think I just say shit, say a poop comes out of my mouth.

593
00:45:11,648 --> 00:45:14,804
但我始终会拿着0.45的枪指着你
I will however plug a .45 in your brainpan.

594
00:45:15,727 --> 00:45:18,119
我不怕坦白
I don't mind commitments.

595
00:45:18,144 --> 00:45:22,948
可能你自己根本拿不稳枪
It's kind of sad you and your sticky fingers probably find hard to grasp.

596
00:45:27,747 --> 00:45:30,019
做个决定吧 先生
Make a decision, sir.

597
00:45:41,122 --> 00:45:43,995
你要去哪 先生？

可以暂时出去一下吗 谢谢

605
00:46:05,965 --> 00:46:07,982
这是你合约的尾款
This is the balance of your contract.

606
00:46:08,007 --> 00:46:09,998
-我了解你很难受 -对 我很难受
- I understand you're upset. - Yes, I'm upset.

You think he didn't know how to check his blood sugar?

610

不管还有什么问题没找出来

612
00:46:24,802 --> 00:46:27,459

As far as I'm concerned whatever he did is forgiven.

613
00:46:27,484 --> 00:46:29,080
不好意思…我得完成 拜托
Please... I need to finish. Please.

你觉得这是真的吗？

Chilton真的自杀了？

622
00:47:05,211 --> 00:47:07,530
你觉得是我俩的责任吗？

623
00:47:07,807 --> 00:47:10,956
我很难理解人们的做法

If that were true, you would be covered in blood and snort, not them.

Tapping into that aggression requires peeling back several layers of yourself.

640
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:28,576

把那个会计叫进来

她没听电话
She's not answering.

691
00:58:09,150 --> 00:58:10,804
早知道我们带个小盒子了

Running isn't an option for me. I can't just walk out on my life!

703
01:00:10,462 --> 01:00:13,793
我们应该去找警察 正常的纳税人都会这样做
We've to go to the police! That's what normal taxpaying people do!

The police can't protect you from someone who could afford to return 61 million dollars.

705
01:00:18,019 --> 01:00:19,835
还上了？什么意思 “还”？
Return? What are you talking about, "Return".

706
01:00:19,867 --> 01:00:21,800
那些钱被人还上了

你在干什么？

709
01:01:25,637 --> 01:01:28,381
-你是谁？ -你不可以…你不该上来的
- Who are you? - You can't... You should not be here.

一辆Panamerica的拖车里

717
01:01:52,375 --> 01:01:54,175
不 我不住这

718
01:01:54,200 --> 01:01:56,542
这是一个储藏库 住这太奇怪了
This is a storage unit. That would be weird.

719
01:01:56,567 --> 01:01:58,280
这是该奇怪的点吗？
That's what would be weird?

720
01:01:58,305 --> 01:02:00,296
我只是在这里待得比较久
I just spend more time here.

721
01:02:00,321 --> 01:02:04,066
不过 我担心有的客户会跟踪我
However, I'm afraid some of my clients have followed me.

722
01:02:04,321 --> 01:02:07,548
你的客户为什么会跟踪你？你只是个会计啊
Why would your clients follow you? You're an accountant.

723
01:02:07,578 --> 01:02:10,547
你怎么知道现在该做什么？为什么你在打包？
How do you know what to do here? Why are you prepared for this?

724
01:02:10,581 --> 01:02:12,199
另外 这是一辆拖车
Plus, this is on wheels.

725
01:02:12,224 --> 01:02:15,618
所以十二分钟内我就可以挂上车离开了 正常情况下
Which means I could hook it and be gone in 12 minutes, usually.

726
01:02:15,643 --> 01:02:18,638
你在讽刺我吗？黑色幽默？
Sarcasm.Is that sarcasm?

727
01:02:18,663 --> 01:02:21,734
不是 不是讽刺 我不会讽刺这个技能
No, that's not sarcasm. I don't use sarcasm material please.

728
01:02:21,759 --> 01:02:24,549
我在这个世界上最重要的东西 都在拖车里了
Everything in the world that is important to me, is in this trailer.

And right now, changing my routine for you is jeopardizing that.

730
01:02:31,910 --> 01:02:34,631
那幅画不会是波洛克的真迹吧！

731
01:02:39,105 --> 01:02:40,712

啊 对 发现什么了吗？
Ah, yeah. Anything luck?

736
01:03:06,500 --> 01:03:08,682
这条音轨很不寻常
It's an unusual audio file.

737
01:03:08,707 --> 01:03:12,574
《所罗门·格兰迪》是十九世纪流行的一首童谣
Solomon Grundy is a nursery rhyme, circled in 1800s.

Your voice has four of the six intonation patterns we use to define American English.

739
01:03:17,148 --> 01:03:20,083
这很难辨认出来
That's difficult to confirm with a rhyme.

740
01:03:20,084 --> 01:03:23,264
不过我好奇的是 你研究的人受过心理创伤吗？
Out of curiosity...was your subject a trauma victim?

741
01:03:23,289 --> 01:03:25,446
嗯？你为什么这样问？
Um. Why you ask that?

742
01:03:25,471 --> 01:03:27,919
因为你在提交的档案中提到
Well, you indicated on your submission,

743

这个人是在高压环境里念的童谣

748
01:03:44,446 --> 01:03:46,651
到底是什么意思？
So what does that mean exactly?

749
01:03:46,676 --> 01:03:51,128
这种情况我们常常在受过心理创伤的儿童中发现

Okay, so, let's say I was looking at mug shots,

754

这两件事有什么联系 这个人应该有什么特征？
how would that present itself, what exactly am I looking for?

Autism is nearly impossible to identify visually.

根本不合理啊
None of this makes sense.

我从没去过别的地方

你的人生…很独特
Your life is... unique.

823

并不独特 我患有

高强度的自闭症

我的视角特别狭窄
means I have an extremely narrow focus,

826
01:09:20,513 --> 01:09:23,596
而且一旦接受任务就一定要把它完成
and a hard time abandoning tasks once I've taken them up.

827
01:09:23,621 --> 01:09:28,291
和不认识的人社交我也有困难
I have difficulties socializing with other people I don't know,

828
01:09:29,132 --> 01:09:31,071
我想社交的

829
01:09:36,927 --> 01:09:39,231
在我高中毕业那年
When I was a senior in high school.

830
01:09:39,256 --> 01:09:41,862
我想准备一条特别的裙子去参加毕业舞会
I wanted this special dress for prom.

831
01:09:41,887 --> 01:09:44,137
我告诉自己 花一百块去买条垃圾裙子
I told myself that spending a hundred bucks on a trashy dress

832
01:09:44,162 --> 01:09:45,644
我一生也就只会穿一次 就是去参加舞会
that I was going to wear one time to an event

833
01:09:45,669 --> 01:09:47,051
而且那裙子我还不喜欢
that I thought was silly in the first place,

834
01:09:47,076 --> 01:09:48,397
-根本就是… -浪费
- it's just... - Wasteful.

835
01:09:48,422 --> 01:09:49,840
对
Yes.

836
01:09:49,865 --> 01:09:54,461
然后Vera Wang有一条经典的露肩小黑裙
But Vera Wang made this black strapless classic,

837
01:09:54,486 --> 01:09:57,115
那裙子贵非常多 但你可以穿着它去参加很多活动
it was more expensive but you could wear it to all kinds of future events.

838
01:09:57,140 --> 01:09:59,091
-这就是投资 -对！
- It's an investment. - Yes!

839
01:09:59,116 --> 01:10:01,190
你在哪上高中的？
Where were you when I was in high school?

840
01:10:01,215 --> 01:10:03,776
以色列

841
01:10:05,175 --> 01:10:07,304
好吧 嗯
Right. Um.

842
01:10:07,328 --> 01:10:09,517
问题就是 那条裙子要价1700美元
The problem is. They wanted $1700 dollars for this dress,

843
01:10:09,543 --> 01:10:10,758
我根本买不起 所以我…
and I didn't have that so...

844
01:10:10,783 --> 01:10:12,943
-你向父母要钱？ -没有

845
01:10:13,229 --> 01:10:14,775
慢慢听

01:10:16,199 --> 01:10:19,134
二十一点 我从来没玩过这个
Black Jack. I never played a hand but I...

847
01:10:19,169 --> 01:10:21,586
我去图书馆 看了所有讲二十一点攻略的书
went to the library and checked out all these books on strategy.

848
01:10:21,611 --> 01:10:24,278
然后我通过数学俱乐部去了小赌城！
And I turned the Naperville North math club into a little Vegas!

849
01:10:24,303 --> 01:10:26,919
-什么是“数学俱乐部”？-就是数学俱乐部
- What's a "math club"? - Math club.

850
01:10:27,549 --> 01:10:29,411
就是和其他学校比赛
You compete against other schools.

851
01:10:29,446 --> 01:10:31,730
比数学理论和算数速度
Theory and speed math.

852
01:10:31,740 --> 01:10:37,284
比如298567乘92等于多少
Like what's 298,567 times 92.

853
01:10:37,309 --> 01:10:42,921

854
01:10:46,201 --> 01:10:48,241
对 嗯
Right. Um.

855
01:10:49,109 --> 01:10:50,665
讲回二十一点
Black Jack.

856
01:10:50,690 --> 01:10:53,791
我懂得了怎么打 怎么分
I could tell you when to hit, stand, split, re-split,

857
01:10:53,816 --> 01:10:57,356
怎么去算牌 随机猜牌 还有扣牌
then moved on to card counting, shuffle tracking, hole carding.

858
01:10:57,381 --> 01:11:01,196
然后我拿着我全部身家183美元
And I took everything I had, which is $183 dollars,

859
01:11:01,221 --> 01:11:04,190
开车去了Harrahs赌场
and I drove down to Harrahs in Joliet.

860
01:11:04,215 --> 01:11:07,931
-为什么那条裙子那么重要？-不是裙子的问题
- Why was this dress so important to you? - It wasn't about the dress.

861
01:11:09,619 --> 01:11:14,386
而是我希望我穿着它走进舞会时 大家都会“哇”
I just wanted to walk into that gym and have everybody say “Wow.”

862
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:18,058
我只是想…
I was trying to...

863
01:11:18,161 --> 01:11:21,688
慢慢听 我想融入大家
Hold on.I was trying to connect.

864
01:11:24,422 --> 01:11:28,037
可能不管我俩有多不一样 但我们都想做同一件事
I think no matter how different, we're all trying to do the same thing.

865
01:11:31,241 --> 01:11:36,714
后来 玩的前十分钟我就输了二十块
But I... I lost all but 20 bucks in the first 10 minutes.

866
01:11:37,517 --> 01:11:42,231
然后我把剩下的钱都放进了硬币机里 赢了两千！
Fed that into a nickel slot on the way out and I won 2 grand.

867
01:11:42,425 --> 01:11:45,084
买裙子剩下的钱我用来租了辆林肯
I used the extra cash to pay for a limo.

868
01:11:46,810 --> 01:11:49,440
但其实那条裙子我也就穿了一次
Only wore the dress just the one time.

869
01:12:01,331 --> 01:12:03,447
Chris 为什么我们来这家酒店？

870

对 但这家的毛巾也很棒
Yes, but these towels are very fancy.

874
01:12:17,235 --> 01:12:20,140
便宜的酒店毛巾很差
Cheaper hotels have scratchy towels.

875
01:12:21,402 --> 01:12:22,869
而且…

我也不知道
I don't know.

898
01:13:36,981 --> 01:13:38,948
我们得去问问她

他在耍我们呢

948
01:18:51,521 --> 01:18:54,002
他没办法通过一家会计公司把钱洗干净
He can't clean that kind of money through an accounting firm.

949
01:18:54,027 --> 01:18:55,604
会留下太多痕迹
The paper trail's too heavy.

950
01:18:55,629 --> 01:18:57,471
所以他通过现金交易的商店来洗钱

956
01:19:14,670 --> 01:19:19,672

961
01:19:32,054 --> 01:19:34,526
还花那么多工夫去洗钱
collect his fee, goes to all the trouble laundering it

962
01:19:34,551 --> 01:19:37,258
结果却几乎把所有的钱都捐掉了？
and then gives almost all of it away.

963
01:19:38,266 --> 01:19:40,926
可能他还收其他的报酬呢？
What if he's taking other means of payment?

964
01:19:43,394 --> 01:19:45,466
对 有可能
Yeah. Possible, yeah.

965
01:19:46,883 --> 01:19:48,738
我抓到他了 Ray

90% probability they are all right-handed.

969
01:21:08,690 --> 01:21:11,132
他们欺负我只是意外
It was an accident.

970
01:21:11,383 --> 01:21:13,865
对我而言只是站起来打一架
To me it's stand forth, right wrist.

971
01:21:13,890 --> 01:21:17,656
可能你喜欢在学校后面等着被打吧
Thought maybe you enjoy waiting in the schoolyard sucker punch.

972
01:21:19,611 --> 01:21:23,448
生命充满了一系列选择 没什么新鲜的
Life is a series of choices, none of which are new.

973
01:21:24,643 --> 01:21:28,429
最老的选择是选择要做个受害者
The oldest is choosing to be a victim

974
01:21:28,454 --> 01:21:30,794
还是不要
or choose not to.

975

我戴的新眼镜
They are new glasses.

979
01:21:53,652 --> 01:21:58,688
你觉得你不打回去的话 他们就会喜欢你？
You think if... you don't fight back, then maybe they'll like you?

980
01:21:59,424 --> 01:22:02,618
他们就不再挑剔你和嘲笑你是怪胎？
Stop picking on you, calling you freak?

981
01:22:02,905 --> 01:22:04,567
真相是
Here's what it is.

982
01:22:04,592 --> 01:22:08,319
他们不喜欢你 他们也不是讨厌你
They don't like you, they don't dislike you.

983
01:22:08,344 --> 01:22:11,795
他们怕你 因为你和他们不一样
They are afraid of you. You're different.

984
01:22:12,715 --> 01:22:15,521
不一样迟早都会吓到别人

985
01:22:19,922 --> 01:22:23,701
要做个受害者吗？做出你的选择吧

986
01:22:57,751 --> 01:22:59,203

整个后院都有他的监控

997
01:25:16,014 --> 01:25:17,435
就是这个人了

998
01:25:17,460 --> 01:25:20,750
这个危险的人为什么住在这里？
So why is a guy who's up to his elbows in cash live here?

999
01:25:20,775 --> 01:25:25,386
从他的客户群来看 他觉得融入社会可以活得更久吧

1014
01:26:22,406 --> 01:26:24,374
需要这么劳师动众吗？
Is all this really necessary?

1015
01:26:24,399 --> 01:26:26,136
你应该监视下他的家

1016

但都不是因为这些原因
But for none of those reasons.

1047
01:28:39,768 --> 01:28:43,634
是那些人从会计身上夺走了东西
They had taken something from the man who was killing them.

1048
01:28:44,906 --> 01:28:47,694
一种不可挽回的东西

对他而言非常重要的东西

1082
01:30:59,202 --> 01:31:02,127
我本来只是个财政部的员工

1083
01:31:02,152 --> 01:31:05,132
就要结束自己碌碌无为的工作生涯…

1084
01:31:06,477 --> 01:31:08,245
突然有一天

1085
01:31:08,270 --> 01:31:11,086
却找到了一丝曙光
that break you should've been looking for...

1086
01:31:11,111 --> 01:31:14,337
找到了Francis Silveberg 一个洗黑钱界的传奇人物

1090
01:31:25,876 --> 01:31:29,610
觉得Francis上了年纪 未来若是问询起来会对自己很不利
thought maybe the old man's age made him vulnerable to prosecution.

1091
01:31:29,635 --> 01:31:32,925
就让他的儿子“小托尼”去杀了Francis

Francis ran, became a was a federal informant in return for protective custody.

1094

然后他失去了唯一的保护伞

1099
01:31:51,994 --> 01:31:53,193
大门开启

1100

1111
01:32:44,286 --> 01:32:46,483
然后我遇上了这位会计刺客
And I met our accountant.

1112
01:32:47,801 --> 01:32:50,845
他为什么放过我 我不知道

1113
01:32:51,928 --> 01:32:53,977
但他改变了我的一生
But he changed my life.

1114
01:32:57,013 --> 01:32:59,583
我向财政局递交了辞呈

1115
01:33:00,007 --> 01:33:02,784
开始再一次对每一天充满期待

讲个地方 我会去的

the deaths of Lamar Blackburn and his sister, Rita?

1347
01:54:53,104 --> 01:54:55,944
这个情况很复杂
This is a very fluid situation.

1348
01:54:55,969 --> 01:54:59,648
过去48小时我们发现了很多新情况
With a lot of surprising revelations over the last 48 hours.

1349
01:54:59,673 --> 01:55:03,861

不管我有多想揽这个功劳

我都不能这样做
I can't.

1355

因为这是团队协作的成果
Because this was... a team effort,

1356
01:55:38,777 --> 01:55:43,497
靠大家长时间的传统调查工作
comprised of long hours of good old-fashioned investigative work.

1357
01:55:43,522 --> 01:55:44,783
还有问题吗？
Questions?

1358
01:55:44,808 --> 01:55:46,832
我们可以知道…
Can we get more information...

新罕布什尔州 Harbor精神研究所

他曾经和其他两个孩子一样 曾经也很快乐
He was just like our other two, he was a happy baby.

1361
01:55:54,466 --> 01:55:58,612
但现在他很少说话 感觉就像 这个孩子在消失
Now, he rarely speaks. It's like, our child is missing.

1362
01:55:58,637 --> 01:56:02,861
他不在了 他迷失了 需要我们的帮助
He's not there. He's lost and he needs our help.

1363
01:56:03,842 --> 01:56:05,450
我们觉得…
We thought...

1364
01:56:07,011 --> 01:56:11,602
我们觉得…我们希望他还能回到从前那样
We thought...we hoped that he'd catch back up,

1367
01:56:18,952 --> 01:56:22,119
但是如果有那么一刻 你愿意抛下预期
But if you can put aside for a moment what your pediatrician

1368
01:56:22,144 --> 01:56:24,845
和其他NT对你儿子的评价
and all the other NT's have said about your son...

1369
01:56:24,870 --> 01:56:26,172
NT？
“NT's”?

1370
01:56:26,197 --> 01:56:30,145
拥有典型神经系统的人 就好像我们
“Neuro-typicals.”  The rest of us.

1371
01:56:31,169 --> 01:56:33,036
如果我们错了呢？
What if we're wrong?

1372
01:56:33,404 --> 01:56:39,343
是我们用了错的测试标准来衡量自闭症的儿童？
What if we've been using the wrong tests to quantify intelligence in children with autism?

1373
01:56:40,701 --> 01:56:42,962
你儿子并不差
Your son's not less-than.

1374
01:56:43,654 --> 01:56:45,479
他只是不一样
He's different.

1375
01:56:45,850 --> 01:56:49,843
从现在开始 你对他的期望将会逐渐改变
Now, your expectations for your son may change over time,

1376
01:56:49,854 --> 01:56:55,001

1377
01:56:55,026 --> 01:56:56,967
也有可能不会
They might not.

1378
01:56:57,230 --> 01:56:58,347
但我向你保证
But I guarantee you.

1379
01:56:58,371 --> 01:57:01,157
如果我们让世界给孩子们定了标准
If we let the world set expectations for our children,

1380
01:57:01,182 --> 01:57:03,043
他们的起点就永远是低的

1381
01:57:04,199 --> 01:57:06,084
而且止步不前
and they'll stay there.

1382
01:57:07,986 --> 01:57:11,517
可能你的儿子能做的事超乎你所想
Maybe your son is capable of much more than you know.

1383
01:57:12,648 --> 01:57:16,272
也有可能…有可能
And maybe... Just maybe...

1384
01:57:16,742 --> 01:57:19,397
他只是不懂怎么和我们说
He doesn't understand how to tell us.

1385
01:57:20,295 --> 01:57:21,788
或者
Or...

1386
01:57:22,765 --> 01:57:25,359
我们没有学会怎么去听
we haven't yet learned how to listen.

1387
01:57:51,055 --> 01:57:54,675
嘿 宝贝 我讲了几百次了 别这样到处乱逛
Hey, honey, for the hundredth time, don't wonder off like that.

因为她我开了这个机构
