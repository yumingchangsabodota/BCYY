还不够糟？
Worse?

你把半条街炸飞了
You blew up half a bloody block.

00:17:01,823 --> 00:17:04,276
半条街总比牺牲一体育馆的人强吧？
Well, better half a block than a whole stadium full of people.

57
00:17:04,376 --> 00:17:05,967

我现在是在严肃的问你
This is an official question.

65

那天在墨西哥城 你到底干什么去了？
Mexico city, what were you doing there?

66
00:17:36,098 --> 00:17:39,832
我只是碰巧在度假 早该休的假正好想休了
It's just a coincidence. I was taking some overdue holiday.

67
00:17:41,073 --> 00:17:43,235
那好 行吧
Okay. Fine.

怎么回事 詹姆斯？
What's going on, James?

106
00:20:01,764 --> 00:20:04,387
现在军情六处没有人不在讨论这事儿
There's not one person in MI6 who isn't talking about it.

107
00:20:05,248 --> 00:20:07,941
他们在讨论什么事啊 你说说
Talking about what, exactly?

108
00:20:08,852 --> 00:20:12,035
他们说你在墨西哥这次做的过火了
That what you did in Mexico was one step too far.

109
00:20:12,495 --> 00:20:14,367
还说你玩完了
That you're finished.

110
00:20:14,577 --> 00:20:18,521
-你怎么看？ - 我恰恰觉得你好戏才开场
- What do you think? - I think you're just getting started.

111
00:20:20,003 --> 00:20:23,106
- 我不明白你的意思 - 好吧
- I don't know what you mean. - Fine

112
00:20:24,447 --> 00:20:26,629
我猜你手头有个秘密
I think you've got a secret.

113
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:29,733
而且你跟谁都不想说
And it's something you won't tell anyone.

114
00:20:31,294 --> 00:20:33,496
因为你谁都不相信
Because you don't trust anyone.

115
00:20:43,967 --> 00:20:47,551
我若有什么不测 007 我需要你做件事
If anything happens to me for some reason. I need you to you to do something.

116
00:20:48,271 --> 00:20:51,875
找一个男的 他叫叫马科·斯奇亚拉
Find a man called Marco Sciarra.

117
00:20:52,816 --> 00:20:56,590
干掉他 然后别错过他的葬礼
Kill him. And don't miss the funeral.

118
00:21:00,253 --> 00:21:06,239
- 我的老天 你从哪儿弄到的？ - 她刚死就发到了我的邮箱
- Jesus! Where did you get it? - From my mailbox just after she died.

119
00:21:07,270 --> 00:21:09,933
她总能出乎人意料
She was never short of surprises.

120
00:21:10,784 --> 00:21:13,727
即便是死亡也阻挡不了她的工作
Wasn't gonna let death get in the way of her job.

121
00:21:14,698 --> 00:21:18,902
-而我也开始跟踪斯奇亚拉 - 那你查到什么了？
- I've been tracking Sciarra ever since. - And what have you found?

122
00:21:19,262 --> 00:21:21,565
还没有什么重大发现
Nothing significant, yet.

123
00:21:21,645 --> 00:21:26,109
- 他葬礼是哪天？ - 三天之后 在罗马举行
- When's the funeral? - Three days. In Rome.

124
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:29,092
你要是指望M会批准你去 那你真是疯了
If you think M's signing off for that, you're insane!

125
00:21:29,212 --> 00:21:32,436
- 他不会让你离开半步的 - 是的 这也算是个小麻烦
- He won't let you out of his sight. - Yes, that's a bit of a problem.

126
00:21:33,016 --> 00:21:37,741
听我说 能不能暗地里帮我挖挖情报去？
Listen, could you do a little quiet digging for me?

127
00:21:38,121 --> 00:21:40,714
我在墨西哥听到一个名字 "冥王"
I heard a name in Mexico, The Pale King.

128
00:21:43,187 --> 00:21:45,699
你要我给你当卧底吗？
You want me to be your mole!

129
00:21:47,331 --> 00:21:48,902
没错
Yes.

130
00:21:50,144 --> 00:21:52,936
你凭什么认为我值得信任？
What makes you think you can trust me?

131
00:21:55,609 --> 00:21:57,271
直觉
Instinct.

132
00:22:19,303 --> 00:22:21,926
临时监护令
ORDER of TEMPORARY GUARDIANSHIP.

133

可怜的老楼
Poor old girl.

134
00:22:59,333 --> 00:23:01,235
已经计划被拆除了
Rigged the demolition in a week.

135
00:23:01,876 --> 00:23:04,588
- 拆了比修复重建要省钱 - 也是
Cheaper to knock her down, than to rebuild.

136
00:23:05,349 --> 00:23:08,352
光阴脚步匆匆 谁都不等
Still, "Iron waits for no man" and all that.

137
00:23:09,974 --> 00:23:12,086
对了 钱都花到这上面来了
Anyway, all the money's been spent on this.

138

头24小时接收不到信号的情况
So, we may experience the odd drop in coverage during the first 24 hours.

他整个人都陷进去了
He was obsessed.

259
00:36:15,104 --> 00:36:18,057
他耗在那里的时间比陪我的都要多

你不能去那儿 那可是个杀人不眨眼的地方
If you go there, you're crossing over to a place where there is no mercy

267
00:36:58,828 --> 00:37:00,360
我必须得走
I have to go.

268
00:37:01,992 --> 00:37:04,975
祝你好运 亲爱的露西亚
Good luck, Mrs. Lucia.

269
00:37:52,733 --> 00:37:55,005
嘿 要上哪儿去啊？
Hey, wait there.

270
00:37:55,586 --> 00:37:57,648
还不亮明身份 你这混蛋

271
00:37:58,659 --> 00:38:02,302
-你是谁啊？ - 我是米老鼠呀 你是谁？

272
00:38:04,024 --> 00:38:05,676
请进吧
Sorry.

273
00:38:20,676 --> 00:38:24,637
在线购药网站提供了很好的新销售平台
...pharmacy sites has provided an excellent new sales platform.

274
00:38:24,638 --> 00:38:29,376
我们将许多网站改造成未批准药物的交易场所
We have adapted many of them into clearinghouses for unapproved drugs.

275
00:38:31,011 --> 00:38:34,065
除此之外 最新的数据显示
In addition to which, the latest figures show that presently

276
00:38:34,077 --> 00:38:36,667
我们已控制了70%的抗疟疾疫苗
control 70% of antimalarial vaccines.

277
00:38:36,727 --> 00:38:44,455
34%的艾滋病药物和40%肿瘤药物 在撒哈拉以南的市场
34% on HIV and 40% of all ontological drug across Sub-Saharan Africa.

278
00:38:46,807 --> 00:38:49,299
但是 世界卫生组织真是跟我们过不去
We've faced challenges from the WHO and their campaign

279
00:38:49,311 --> 00:38:51,642
他们正在打击我们所谓的仿冒药品
against our counterfeit pharmaceuticals.

280
00:38:52,423 --> 00:38:55,796
我们已经锁定需要处理的关键人物
We have now identified the key individuals to target.

281
00:38:56,387 --> 00:39:00,030
希望能像人口贩卖委员会那次一样成功
We expect the same success as we had against the Council of Union Traffic.

282
00:39:00,921 --> 00:39:02,633
沃格尔博士
Dr. Vogel.

283
00:39:02,873 --> 00:39:05,119
在委员会全体请辞后

284
00:39:05,175 --> 00:39:10,369
我们已将16万女移民安排进休闲性产业

285
00:39:10,534 --> 00:39:13,894
而接近完成的"九只眼"全球监控倡议

286
00:39:14,194 --> 00:39:18,554
意味着我们将拥有独一无二的监视能力

287
00:39:18,763 --> 00:39:23,193
而现在到了该强势扩张的时候了

288
00:39:23,593 --> 00:39:25,393
这绝对是个好消息

289
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:02,193
别让我打断你们了
Don't let me interrupt you.

290
00:40:12,293 --> 00:40:14,293
这绝对是个好消息

291
00:40:15,100 --> 00:40:17,894
我们得到增强的监控能力

292
00:40:18,209 --> 00:40:20,864
意味着来自政府情报机构的阻力

293
00:40:20,993 --> 00:40:22,686
将被轻而易举化解

294
00:40:23,099 --> 00:40:25,493
我们赢定了

295
00:40:26,193 --> 00:40:27,393
谢谢你 博士
Thank you, Doctor.

296
00:40:28,039 --> 00:40:30,802
现在来处理手头上的事项
Now, onto the matter at hand.

297
00:40:30,932 --> 00:40:34,656
在我们成功实施汉堡和突尼斯的袭击之后
After our successful attack in Hamburg and Tunisia.

298
00:40:34,786 --> 00:40:37,468
在墨西哥城的袭击被迫中止
We abort an attack on Mexico City and

299
00:40:37,469 --> 00:40:41,162
而我们杰出的的同事马科·斯奇亚拉不幸身亡
the death of our valued colleague, Marco Sciarra.

300
00:40:41,302 --> 00:40:44,105
他身后留下了一项未完成的使命
Leave one of his duty, outstanding.

301
00:40:44,676 --> 00:40:47,769
格拉先生 "冥王"必须被处理掉
Se?or Gerard, the Pale King must be terminated.

302
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:50,722
你可否去趟奥尔陶斯？
Will you make the journey to Attersee?

303
00:40:54,922 --> 00:40:57,054
当然可以

304
00:40:57,174 --> 00:40:58,722
我是绝对忠于组织的

305
00:40:59,114 --> 00:41:02,254
我这份忠诚至死不渝

306
00:41:02,422 --> 00:41:04,822
绝不会再有

307
00:41:05,122 --> 00:41:07,722
业余之举

308
00:41:07,722 --> 00:41:11,322
绝不会再示弱

309
00:41:46,018 --> 00:41:50,176
在座有没有哪位反对格拉先生接任这个席位？
Does anyone challenge Se?or Guerra for this position?

310
00:42:15,247 --> 00:42:16,248
欢迎你
Welcome.

311
00:42:16,518 --> 00:42:19,361
请陈述你能接任斯奇亚拉的理由
State your credentials for succeeding, Se?or Guerra.

312
00:43:13,446 --> 00:43:15,157
真有意思
It's funny.

313
00:43:17,570 --> 00:43:21,994
墨西哥那次宛如钟声勾起了我遥远的记忆
All that excitement in Mexico City rang a distant bell.

314
00:43:23,356 --> 00:43:29,622
而现在 就在今晚一刹那间 我突然就全明白了
And now, suddenly this evening it makes perfect sense.

315
00:43:35,027 --> 00:43:37,410
欢迎你 詹姆斯
Welcome, James.

316
00:43:40,643 --> 00:43:46,579
真是好久不见了 但我们最终还是再会了
It's been a long time. But finally here we are!

317
00:43:50,143 --> 00:43:52,735
你怎么才来？
What took you so long?

318
00:44:00,093 --> 00:44:01,434
布 谷
Cuckoo.

319
00:44:04,377 --> 00:44:06,269
再见了 米老鼠
Ciao, Mickey Mouse!

320
00:45:25,208 --> 00:45:26,930
这不是跟我闹着玩儿吗
Are you kidding me?

321
00:45:45,148 --> 00:45:46,330
不会吧
No!

322
00:46:26,039 --> 00:46:27,721
脑子有病啊！
What are you doing?

323
00:46:54,108 --> 00:46:56,010
呼叫莫尼彭尼
Moneypenny.

324
00:46:59,994 --> 00:47:01,745
- 邦德？ - 听着 莫尼彭尼
- Bond? - Listen, Moneypenny.

325
00:47:01,765 --> 00:47:04,238
汉堡 突尼斯和墨西哥袭击是相互关联的
Hamburg, Tunisia, Mexico City, they're all linked.

326
00:47:04,298 --> 00:47:07,151
是同一个组织策划的连环袭击
It's one organization coordinating multiple attacks.

327
00:47:07,211 --> 00:47:09,373
- 看来她说的没错 - 她(M夫人)就没错过
- So she was right. - Of course she was.

328
00:47:09,613 --> 00:47:11,956
- 我查过了 - 谁打来的？
- I ran that check. - Who is it?

329
00:47:12,887 --> 00:47:17,141
是我老板 他信用卡被偷了 不是大事
My boss had his credit card stolen, it's nothing.

330
00:47:17,311 --> 00:47:19,473

- Why don't you go back to sleep? - Don't be long.

331
00:47:19,583 --> 00:47:21,385

- 大半夜还在你那儿？ - 生活就是这样 詹姆斯
At this time of night? It's called life, James.

334
00:47:27,111 --> 00:47:29,183
有时你也该体验下
You should try it sometime.

335
00:47:35,319 --> 00:47:38,432
那个"幽冥国王" 貌似是位你曾经交过手的人
The Pale King, it looks like you've had dealings with him before.

336
00:47:38,452 --> 00:47:41,325
- 量子危机那次 - 果不其然 是怀特先生
- Quantum. - Of course, Mr. White!

337
00:47:41,355 --> 00:47:42,396
就是他
That's him.

338
00:47:42,456 --> 00:47:46,761
最近一次现身 是在奥地利的奥尔陶斯 四个月前的事了

339
00:47:48,132 --> 00:47:49,824
你先等一下
Hope that's all.

340
00:48:01,816 --> 00:48:03,918
- 还没挂吧？ - 没挂
- You still there? - Yeah.

341
00:48:03,958 --> 00:48:06,150
- 我再报个名字行吗？ - 可以 说吧
- Run another name, will you? - Okay.

342
00:48:07,592 --> 00:48:10,795
是个男的 叫弗朗兹·奥伯豪斯
A man called Franz Oberhauss.

343
00:48:13,207 --> 00:48:15,789
查查他生前和死后的档案和行踪
Check his files, before and after his death.

344
00:48:15,995 --> 00:48:17,300
怎么还有死后 什么意思？
After his death? What are you talking about?

345
00:48:17,901 --> 00:48:19,442
拜托 你照办就是了
Please, just do it.

346
00:49:44,349 --> 00:49:47,522
好的 Q 给我亮亮家伙
Okay, Q. Give me something.

347
00:49:59,104 --> 00:50:00,906
真是越来越给劲了
That's more like it.

348
00:50:06,662 --> 00:50:08,133
试试手气吧
Here goes nothing.

349
00:50:44,350 --> 00:50:46,011
晚上好
Good evening.

350
00:51:03,058 --> 00:51:05,501
不要听信他们减少监控的主张
Do not let them tell you, we need less surveillance.

351
00:51:06,472 --> 00:51:07,553
相反要增加更多
We need more.

352
00:51:08,414 --> 00:51:09,785
更加多
Much more.

353
00:51:10,286 --> 00:51:11,327
我愿重申
I say again.

354
00:51:11,347 --> 00:51:15,741
这个九只眼委员会将有权获得
The 9 Eyes Committee will have full access to the combined intelligence

355
00:51:15,751 --> 00:51:17,513
所有成员国的情报信息流
streams of all member states.

356
00:51:17,543 --> 00:51:19,635
数据越多分析得越透彻
More data, more analysis.

357
00:51:20,336 --> 00:51:23,539
发生恐怖袭击的可能性就会越低
Less likelihood of terrorist attacks.

358
00:51:24,140 --> 00:51:25,321
女士们 先生们
Ladies and gentlemen.

359
00:51:25,391 --> 00:51:28,964
到了全世界安全机构联合起来的时候了
It's time for the security services of the world to unite.

360
00:51:29,745 --> 00:51:32,088
各自为战 我们不堪一击
Alone, we are weak.

361
00:51:32,518 --> 00:51:35,741
联合起来 我们汇聚全球力量
Together, we're a global power.

362
00:51:36,032 --> 00:51:37,913
这肯定不走选举程序
An unelected one.

363
00:51:38,914 --> 00:51:40,176
谢谢各位
Thank you.

364

谢谢
Thank you.

365
00:51:43,369 --> 00:51:45,541
现在就方案进行表决
We will now vote on the resolution.

366
00:51:45,942 --> 00:51:48,404
女士们先生们 请开始投票
Ladies and gentlemen, please cast your votes.

367
00:51:54,100 --> 00:51:56,482
结果是八票赞成一票反对
The vote is 8 to 1 in favour.

368
00:51:56,712 --> 00:52:01,547
但是如各位所知 只有全票赞成才能通过决议
However, as you know. We cannot proceed unless the unanimous vote.

369
00:52:01,707 --> 00:52:04,360
因此 九只眼议案未能获得通过
The 9 Eyes notion, is therefore, not passed.

370
00:52:05,221 --> 00:52:06,320
这就是民主啊
Democracy.

371
00:52:06,332 --> 00:52:09,665
感谢女士们先生们 今晚的会议现在休会
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This evening session is adjourned.

372
00:52:12,618 --> 00:52:14,550
(我们能否确定邦德就在伦敦？)

373
00:52:26,002 --> 00:52:29,045
- 长官您好 - 拜托请告诉我007就在伦敦

现在先让我看一下
I'll just take a look now, sir.

376
00:52:33,259 --> 00:52:35,101
因为他要是不在 你丫麻烦就大了
Because if he isn't, you're in deep shit.

377
00:52:36,783 --> 00:52:38,504
我TM就给你10秒钟时间
You've get precisely, 10 seconds.

378
00:52:42,779 --> 00:52:45,151
找到了 长官 他应该是在切尔西
I have him, sir. He appears to be in Chelsea.

379
00:52:45,622 --> 00:52:48,495
给我盯死了 等我回来 明白吗？
Well, I want eyes on him when I get back. Understood?

380
00:52:49,275 --> 00:52:53,470
我完全明白您的意思 长官
I completely understand... Sir..

381
00:55:46,344 --> 00:55:49,046
帮我个忙行吗？ 下手要快点儿
Do me a favour, make it quick.

382
00:55:49,247 --> 00:55:51,739
到楼上来 怀特先生
Upstairs, Mr. White.

383
00:56:01,479 --> 00:56:06,584
我知道死神会以一张熟悉的面孔前来索命 但没想到会是你
I always knew death would wear a familiar face but not yours.

384
00:56:07,034 --> 00:56:10,188
我为何会有此等荣幸啊 邦德先生？
So watch over this place here, Mr. Bond.

385
00:56:12,170 --> 00:56:14,502
最近我参加了一场会议
I was at a meeting recently.

386
00:56:14,702 --> 00:56:16,524
然后出现了你的名字
And your name came up.

387
00:56:16,724 --> 00:56:19,567
很荣幸伦敦方面还在讨论我
I'm flattered London is still talking about me.

388
00:56:19,657 --> 00:56:23,671
那不是军情六处的会 是在罗马开的
It wasn't MI6. It was Rome.

389
00:56:24,722 --> 00:56:27,005
是你的组织 不是我的
Your team, not mine.

390
00:56:32,730 --> 00:56:37,455
上个月 我在手机里发现了剧毒的金属铊(放射性有毒金属元素)
Last month, I found Thallium in my cell phone.

391
00:56:37,465 --> 00:56:38,656
他真是不辱使命
It's done its job.

392
00:56:38,676 --> 00:56:42,030
我就剩几个星期了 没准还短点
I have a few weeks. Maybe less.

393
00:56:44,192 --> 00:56:47,245
所以说真是缘分啊 邦德先生
So, here we are, Mr. Bond.

394
00:56:47,485 --> 00:56:50,208
两个将死之人一起共度良宵
Two dead men enjoying the evening.

395
00:56:50,919 --> 00:56:54,152
- 你到底干了什么？ - 我没有听他的命令
- What did you do? - I disobeyed them.

396
00:56:55,083 --> 00:56:59,968
我曾竭尽全力追随他 可是他变了
Followed him as far as I could and he... changed.

397
00:57:00,058 --> 00:57:04,062
我明白了 你良心发现了
Oh, I see. You grew conscious.

398
00:57:04,262 --> 00:57:07,325
咱们恩怨归恩怨 可这样
Our game is our game. But this...

399
00:57:08,376 --> 00:57:11,199
干扯上女人 扯上儿童
women, children.

400
00:57:11,219 --> 00:57:14,592
这金属铊起码说明他不再欣赏你了
Well, the Thallium would suggest he doesn't like you very much anymore.

401
00:57:14,653 --> 00:57:16,735
而且你看他也是一样的
I'm clear that the feeling in mutual.

402
00:57:16,905 --> 00:57:18,917
你还不如告诉我该怎样找到他
So, why don't you tell me how to find him again?

403
00:57:19,017 --> 00:57:22,522
- 得了吧 - 告诉我他在哪儿
- Oh, come on! Tell me where he is.

404
00:57:22,603 --> 00:57:26,034
他无处不在 无处不在
He's everywhere! Everywhere!

405
00:57:26,104 --> 00:57:28,935
他堂而皇之地坐在你书桌前 他吻着你的女人
He's sitting at your desk, he's kissing with your

406
00:57:28,947 --> 00:57:31,620
还和你家人淡定地共进晚餐
love or he's doing something with your family!

407
00:57:38,637 --> 00:57:40,999
你是在掩护某个人吧？
You're protecting someone.

408
00:57:41,920 --> 00:57:43,381
是你夫人吗？
Your wife?

409
00:57:46,455 --> 00:57:48,727
她很久之前就不在了
She left long ago.

410
00:57:48,887 --> 00:57:49,988
那是你的儿子？
Your son?

411
00:57:54,483 --> 00:57:56,415
还是你女儿？
Your daughter.

412
00:57:58,517 --> 00:58:01,119
你找不到她的 她相当聪明
You won't find her, she's clever.

413
00:58:01,420 --> 00:58:04,373
她比我聪明 知道怎么躲起来
She's smarter than me, she knows how to hide.

414
00:58:06,365 --> 00:58:08,627
说出那人在哪 我就能保护你女儿
I can protect her, if you tell me where he is.

415
00:58:11,490 --> 00:58:14,162
- 我能保住她的命 - 好啊
- I can keep her alive. - Yeah?

416
00:58:17,366 --> 00:58:20,189
- 我向你承诺 - 你向我承诺？
- You have my word. - Your word?!

417
00:58:20,939 --> 00:58:22,971
一个杀手也能信？
The word of an assassin?

418
00:58:35,194 --> 00:58:36,825
说到做到
That's my word.

419
00:59:04,573 --> 00:59:08,777
"美国人" 你只要能救她
American. You save her.

420
00:59:08,948 --> 00:59:12,051
她就能带你去"美国人"那儿 她非常了解
She can lead you to the American, she knows the American.

421
00:59:12,761 --> 00:59:17,636
先去霍夫勒诊所看看
Try the Chauffeur Clinic.

422
00:59:21,911 --> 00:59:26,455
你现在就是只风筝 在飓风中飞舞的风筝 邦德先生
You're a kite dancing in a hurricane, Mr. Bond.

423
00:59:29,528 --> 00:59:30,629
永别了
So long!

424
01:00:24,253 --> 01:00:27,226
你可真行 能让政府财政出钱为这个吐血买单
Can't deny I'm impressed you got HMG to cough up for all of us.

425
01:00:27,306 --> 01:00:29,729
得了 政府哪有钱盖这种大楼啊
Good God, the government couldn't afford this kind of facility.

426
01:00:29,749 --> 01:00:32,652
大部分还得靠私营企业的捐助
No, it was benefactor. Mostly from the private sector.

427
01:00:33,222 --> 01:00:34,133
当正式运行了
When it goes online,

428
01:00:34,183 --> 01:00:36,367
这栋楼将成为史上最强悍的
this building will be the most sophisticated

429
01:00:36,379 --> 01:00:38,037
数据收集系统
data gathering system in history.

430
01:00:38,107 --> 01:00:41,070
成为全天候主宰世界的数字幽灵
The World's digital ghost available 24/7

431
01:00:41,120 --> 01:00:42,882
也是乔治·奥威尔的终极噩梦
George Orwell's worse nightmare.

432
01:00:42,952 --> 01:00:44,624
你喜欢就好
I'm glad you like it.

433
01:00:44,704 --> 01:00:47,367
九只眼未获全票通过真是遗憾
My commiseration on losing the 9 Eyes vote.

434
01:00:47,577 --> 01:00:49,669
- 对你打击挺大吧 - 倒没什么
- Must have been a blow. - Not really.

435
01:00:49,949 --> 01:00:53,011
南非方面想通也只是个时间问题
Only matter of time before South Africa sees the light and you know what they say,

436
01:00:53,012 --> 01:00:55,605
而且罗马也不是一天建成的 可能用了一天半呢
Rome wasn't built in a day, a day and a half maybe.

437
01:00:56,676 --> 01:00:59,619
我说麦克斯 我知道监控这事是日常必备
Look, Max. I know surveillance is fact of life.

438
01:01:01,201 --> 01:01:05,535
但让我担心的是你使用情报的方式 以及谁会用这些情报
It's how you use the information that concerns me and who is using it.

439
01:01:05,575 --> 01:01:08,198
这是保障公众安全所必须的
This is what we need to do to keep the people safe.

440
01:01:08,668 --> 01:01:10,880
00项目已经过时了
00 Program is prehistoric.

441
01:01:11,811 --> 01:01:16,006
现在你还能单靠一个特工就包打天下吗？
Come on, M. You can't tell me that one man in the field can compete with all of this.

442
01:01:16,026 --> 01:01:18,108
有杀人执照也力不从心啊
Running around out there with his license to kill?

443
01:01:19,879 --> 01:01:22,242
你有没有真正杀过人 麦克斯？
Have you ever had to kill a man, Max?

444
01:01:23,423 --> 01:01:25,045
有吗？
Have you?

445
01:01:25,245 --> 01:01:27,547
要心里有底 你才可以扣动扳机
To pull that trigger, you have to be strong.

446
01:01:27,567 --> 01:01:31,771
是的 先要进行调查 要分析评估 锁定目标
Yes, you investigate, analyze, assess, target.

447
01:01:32,642 --> 01:01:38,198
然后你要盯着对方的眼睛 接着做出判断
And then you have to look them in the eye and make the call.

448
01:01:38,208 --> 01:01:43,964
那些个无人机 窃听器 摄像头 速记 以及所有现行的监控手段
And all the drones, bugs, cameras and all the surveillance in the world.

449
01:01:44,024 --> 01:01:46,496
都不会告诉你下一步怎么办
Can't tell you what to do next.

450
01:01:48,008 --> 01:01:53,573
一张杀人执照 也是一张不乱杀人的执照
A license to kill. Is also a license not to kill.

451
01:01:55,275 --> 01:01:57,457
我这么做也是被迫的
I didn't want to have to do this.

452
01:01:58,829 --> 01:02:01,932
你好像已经控制不了你的特工了
But it looks like you still can't control your agent.

453
01:02:03,463 --> 01:02:05,635
邦德 我帮你查过了
Bond, I ran that check.

454
01:02:06,516 --> 01:02:09,239
貌似是位你曾经交过手的人 量子危机那次
Looks like you've had dealings with him before, Quantum.

455
01:02:09,249 --> 01:02:11,191
果不其然 是怀特先生
Of course, Mr. White!

456
01:02:11,361 --> 01:02:14,695
最近一次现身 是在奥地利的奥尔陶斯
Last unconfirmed sighting, Attersee in Austria.

457
01:02:14,755 --> 01:02:15,836
我再报个名字行吗？
Run another name, will you?

458
01:02:17,958 --> 01:02:20,731
所以实施全面监控看来并非无稽之谈
So, something to be said for total surveillance after all.

459
01:02:23,984 --> 01:02:26,506
你们监控军情六处的探员
You watch MI6 agents?

460
01:02:27,578 --> 01:02:28,709
我们谁都监控
I watch everyone.

461
01:03:35,576 --> 01:03:38,459
您先请坐 我这边很快就完了
Please take a seat. I'll be with you in just a moment.

Prescribed medicine along with the TCC.

464
01:03:55,076 --> 01:03:57,698
请多包涵 邦德先生
Please excuse me, Mr. Bond.

465
01:03:59,870 --> 01:04:02,233
我是玛德琳·斯旺医生
My name is Dr. Madeleine Swann.

466
01:04:02,463 --> 01:04:06,467
我们今天的任务是分析你的需求 包括心理和身体两个层面
Our job today's to analyze your needs both physiological and physical.

467
01:04:06,767 --> 01:04:08,880
真是开门见山啊
Sounds pretty straight forward.

468
01:04:09,790 --> 01:04:12,493
希望您别介意 这景色容易让人分心
I hope you don't mind, the video can be a bit distracting.

469
01:04:12,693 --> 01:04:14,595
我还没注意到呢
I haven't noticed.

470
01:04:20,441 --> 01:04:23,444
您已经填了大部分的材料
I you've filled out most of the paperwork.

471
01:04:23,464 --> 01:04:27,358
可以的话想问一下剩余的几个问题以完成评估
Just a few questions to complete your evaluation, if I may?

472
01:04:27,959 --> 01:04:31,482
- 你平时锻炼吗？ - 必要时才炼
- You exercise? - When I have to.

473
01:04:31,933 --> 01:04:35,356
你觉得工作给你带来的压力大吗？
You consider employment to be physiologically stressful?

474
01:04:35,837 --> 01:04:37,068
有时候觉得
Sometimes.

475
01:04:37,478 --> 01:04:39,580
一般会喝多少酒？
How much alcohol do you consume?

476
01:04:40,051 --> 01:04:41,623
过量
Too much.

477
01:04:44,125 --> 01:04:48,089
我的问题再放宽点 小时候 你跟你的父母很亲近吗？
Some broader questions: As a child, would you say you were close to your parents?

478
01:04:48,169 --> 01:04:49,811
我从小父母就去世了
My parents died when I was young.

479
01:04:51,512 --> 01:04:53,164
当时几岁？
Really? How old?

480
01:04:53,695 --> 01:04:56,648
- 反正能记事了 - 能问问怎么死的吗？
- Old enough to remember. - How, if I may ask?

481
01:04:57,038 --> 01:04:59,150
- 爬山时发生了意外
A climbing accident.

482
01:04:59,350 --> 01:05:02,043
- 谁把你抚养成人的？ - 是别的人
- Then who brought you up? - Someone else.

483
01:05:02,654 --> 01:05:04,456
我能问问吗？
Humor me.

484

一位就读过牛津和索邦两所名校
How does one train at Oxford and the Sorbonne

485
01:05:07,699 --> 01:05:11,312
当上顾问 在无国界医生组织工作两年的人
become a consultant, spend 2 years with medicine fortifier

486
01:05:11,473 --> 01:05:13,615
怎么会来到这荒山野岭的地方？
and then end up here?

487
01:05:14,536 --> 01:05:18,910
请恕我冒昧 人家很容易会认为你是在有所回避
Forgive me, but anyone might think you're hiding from something.

488
01:05:20,632 --> 01:05:22,964
您来这儿可是花了不少钱的 邦德先生
You're paying a lot of money to be here, Mr. Bond.

489
01:05:23,074 --> 01:05:27,599
- 到底是我问你啊 还是你问我？ - 当然你问了 请继续
- Who's asking the questions? You or me? - Of course, carry on.

490
01:05:31,052 --> 01:05:33,765
这最后一问你是空着的
I see you left this final question blank.

491
01:05:34,726 --> 01:05:35,857
你做什么职业？
What is your occupation?

492
01:05:35,977 --> 01:05:39,961
这个要是填在表上恐怕会不太好看
Well, that's not the sort of thing that looks good on a form.

493
01:05:40,141 --> 01:05:43,154
- 为什么呢？ - 我的工作是杀人
- And why is that? - I kill people.

494
01:05:45,567 --> 01:05:47,689

告诉我父亲已经死了？

你在撒谎
You're lying.

504
01:06:19,411 --> 01:06:20,662
- 他凭什么相信你？
Why would he trust you?

505
01:06:21,003 --> 01:06:24,306
因为他也知道我有求于你们
Because he knew that I needed something in return.

506
01:06:24,626 --> 01:06:28,540
- 你想干什么？ - 帮我找到"美国人"

01:07:17,359 --> 01:07:20,402
你要是来取车 车已经沉到台伯河底去了
If you've come for the car, I parked it at the bottom of the toilet.

516
01:07:20,422 --> 01:07:23,755
别担心 007 那只是辆价值三百万英镑的概念车
Oh, not to worry, 007. It was only a 3 million pound prototype.

517
01:07:23,756 --> 01:07:26,888
- 你怎么来了 Q？ - 我就是纯粹想休息一下而已
- Why are you here, Q? - Oh, I just fancied a break to be honest

518
01:07:26,889 --> 01:07:29,071
最近工作压力有点大
I've been experiencing a lot of stress recently.

519
01:07:29,281 --> 01:07:31,275
军情五处整天盯着我们
What we see is people crawling all over us and the fact

520
01:07:31,287 --> 01:07:33,115
M也想把我挂在圣诞树上当装饰品
everyone wants my balls for Christmas decorations.

521
01:07:33,165 --> 01:07:37,430
- 说重点 - 007 重点就是 弗朗兹·奥伯豪斯不仅死了
Get to the point - The point, 007, is that Frank Oberhauser is dead.

522
01:07:37,540 --> 01:07:38,961
棺材都下葬了
Dead and buried.

除非你现在就跟我回去

career and Moneypenny's will go the same way.

525
01:07:43,536 --> 01:07:46,181
你明白吗 现在事态已经全面失控了 你要是不
Do you understand? All hell is breaking loose...

526
01:07:46,193 --> 01:07:47,079
我看见他了
I saw him.

527
01:07:47,179 --> 01:07:48,981
那是你的臆想
You thought you saw him.

528
01:07:49,181 --> 01:07:51,193
我们查阅了所有记录
We've been through the record.

529
01:07:51,223 --> 01:07:53,524
20年前他和他父亲死于一场雪崩
Died in a avalanche, with his father, 20 years...

530
01:07:53,536 --> 01:07:54,307
是

531
01:07:54,317 --> 01:07:57,610
这些我都知道 但我的确又见到他了
I know that but I saw him.

532
01:07:59,352 --> 01:08:01,584
我是不可能忘记他的
It's not someone I'd ever forget.

533
01:08:02,605 --> 01:08:04,947
这么说 你有什么头绪吗？
So, you have a lead?

534
01:08:05,007 --> 01:08:09,402
- 有这么个名字 "美国人" - 这就能缩小范围了吗？
I have a name, American. That narrows it down.

535
01:08:09,472 --> 01:08:12,003
对不起 007 先说到这儿吧
Look I'm sorry, 007. Time's up.

536
01:08:12,004 --> 01:08:14,016
我的前途现在悬于一线了
I whole career is on the line here.

537
01:08:14,086 --> 01:08:17,810
要么你现在回去走正常的渠道办事 要么我直接向M报告
Either you come back in and do this through proper channels or I'll go directly to M.

538
01:08:17,840 --> 01:08:20,503
再帮我办件事吧 然后就没你事了
Do one more thing for me, then you're out.

539
01:08:21,534 --> 01:08:23,826
查查这东西的来头
Find out what you can from this.

540
01:08:32,295 --> 01:08:35,989
- 我现在真是恨死你了 - 谢了 Q
- I really, really hate you right now. - Thank you, Q.

541
01:08:36,639 --> 01:08:39,963
- 先生 行了吗？ - 请稍等 你住哪啊？
- Monsieur? Now, please. - Where are you staying?

542
01:08:40,063 --> 01:08:42,976
佩夫斯纳旅馆 12号房 - 一小时后见
At Desner, room 12 - One hour.

543
01:08:43,866 --> 01:08:47,750
您的饮料 先生 一杯热解消化酶奶昔
Here you are, sir. One proactive digestive enzyme shake.

544
01:08:47,790 --> 01:08:51,174
能帮我个忙吗 把这玩意倒厕所里
Do me a favour for me, will you? Thrown that down the toilet.

545
01:08:51,374 --> 01:08:53,236
中间环节都省了
Cut out the middle man.

546
01:09:02,235 --> 01:09:04,277
你待着别动
No, stay!

547
01:09:54,447 --> 01:09:56,079
你们想要什么？
What do you want?

548
01:09:59,312 --> 01:10:00,844
你在干什么？
What are you doing?

549
01:10:02,085 --> 01:10:04,448
你们都是哑巴吗？
Can any of you speak.

550
01:13:29,804 --> 01:13:32,437
顶住
Come on!

551
01:14:29,494 --> 01:14:32,658
- 好了 快出来 - 别碰我
- Come out. - Aargh, don't touch me!

552
01:14:34,199 --> 01:14:37,112
你应该先好好喘口气 冷静一下情绪
Hey, you need to take a breath and calm down.

553
01:14:37,122 --> 01:14:40,546
- 你是受惊吓了 - 离我远点 给我走开行不行
- You're in shock. - Get away from me! Just get away!

554
01:14:40,926 --> 01:14:43,789
你不觉得是你把他们引来的吗
Did it cross your mind that you lead them to me?!

555
01:14:49,064 --> 01:14:50,636
我现在没时间解释
I haven't got time for this.

556
01:14:50,726 --> 01:14:54,319
你必须告诉我和"美国人"有关的一切细节
You need to tell me everything you know about American.

557
01:14:54,440 --> 01:14:55,691
见鬼去吧
Go to hell!

558
01:14:58,774 --> 01:15:00,986
我向你父亲保证过
I gave your father my word.

559
01:15:02,498 --> 01:15:06,752
我凭什么相信你 就因为我父亲信任你吗？
And why should I trust you? Because my father did?

560
01:15:06,862 --> 01:15:13,248
因为此时此刻 斯旺医生 我是你活下去的唯一机会
Because right now, Dr. Swann. I'm your best chance of staying alive.

561
01:15:36,662 --> 01:15:40,686
斯旺医生 这位是Q  Q 这位是斯旺医生
Dr. Swann, Q. Q, Dr. Swann.

562
01:15:41,227 --> 01:15:43,429
- 你好 - 幸会幸会

564
01:15:49,055 --> 01:15:51,467
- 可是 邦德 - 她已经知道了
- But Bond! - She knows.

565
01:15:52,158 --> 01:15:56,402
- 你查到了什么？ - 我得向你道歉 007
- What have you got? - I owe you an apology, 007.

566
01:15:56,602 --> 01:15:58,674
你这回中大奖了
You are on to something.

567
01:15:58,934 --> 01:16:02,168
奥伯豪斯确实还没死 这戒指就是证明
Oberhauser is still alive, the ring proves it.

568
01:16:02,518 --> 01:16:05,431
我搜遍了近五年的工作记录 他们都指向同一个组织
And it seems they were all part of one organization.

569
01:16:05,781 --> 01:16:09,735
拉契夫 量子项目 斯奇亚拉 你的朋友 席尔瓦先生
Le Chiffre, Quantum, Sciarra, your friend, Mr. Silva.

570
01:16:09,835 --> 01:16:11,427
你知道他们都和谁有关联吗？
And do you know who links them all?

571
01:16:11,928 --> 01:16:14,550
- 是他 - 没错就是他(弗朗兹·奥伯豪斯)
- Him. - Exactly.

572
01:16:14,610 --> 01:16:18,624
- 这个神秘组织 知道它叫什么名字吗？ - 不知道
- This organization, do you know what's it called? - No.

573
01:16:18,865 --> 01:16:20,336
"幽灵党"
S.P.E.C.T.R.E.

574
01:16:22,218 --> 01:16:25,701
- 它的名字叫"幽灵党" - 她怎么会知道？
- Its name is SPECTRE. - How does she know that?

575
01:16:25,741 --> 01:16:28,154
因为我父亲就是组织成员
Because my father was part of it.

576
01:16:29,155 --> 01:16:31,017
那么 你应该看看这个
You might all want to see this.

577
01:16:31,257 --> 01:16:34,971
现在切换到南非现场传来的画面 我们能看到的是
Looking at pictures from South Africa right now, is what appears to be...

578
01:16:36,032 --> 01:16:38,895
Q 马上回伦敦去
Q, go back to London.

579
01:16:39,926 --> 01:16:41,317
M需要你的帮助
M's gonna need your help.

580
01:16:41,387 --> 01:16:42,809
然后继续追踪我
Keep tracking me.

581
01:16:42,869 --> 01:16:47,503
我会的 对了 邦德 你一定要找到"美国人"
I will and Bond. You have to find American.

582
01:16:48,004 --> 01:16:49,936
他是找到奥伯豪斯的唯一线索
He's our only link to Oberhauser.

583
01:16:50,056 --> 01:16:54,030
"美国人"不是一个人 那是一个地点
It's not a person, it's a place.

584
01:16:56,056 --> 01:17:00,030
摩洛哥 吉尔丹

585
01:17:59,356 --> 01:18:00,577
谢谢
Thank you.

586
01:18:32,389 --> 01:18:35,152
他俩就在这儿过的新婚之夜
This is where they spent the wedding night.

587
01:18:36,353 --> 01:18:38,255
然后每年都会回来一次
They came back every year.

588
01:18:39,266 --> 01:18:42,029
后来又带着我一起来
Then they brought me with them too.

589
01:18:44,571 --> 01:18:48,065
即使后来都离婚了 父亲一个人还来
He kept coming back, even after the divorce.

590
01:18:49,837 --> 01:18:52,129
那我觉得 太遗憾了
Well, then. I'm sorry.

591
01:18:52,850 --> 01:18:54,261
为什么？
What for?

592
01:19:09,757 --> 01:19:11,358
这是什么？
What is it?

593
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:14,942
属于你的遗产
It's an inheritance.

594
01:19:15,382 --> 01:19:18,385
- 不来点吗？ - 不了 谢谢
- Want some? - No, thank you.

595
01:19:19,306 --> 01:19:20,948
错过了好事别赖我啊
You don't know what you're missing.

596
01:19:30,718 --> 01:19:33,130
不可能就这么点吧
This can't be it.

597
01:19:33,480 --> 01:19:35,933
算了 先敬你爸一杯
Well, here's to your father.

598
01:19:37,174 --> 01:19:42,580
我答应过我自己 绝不让自己再受到那个男人的伤害
I promised myself, I would never be hurt by that man again.

599
01:19:43,100 --> 01:19:45,783
跟他断了一切联系
I could have hold contact.

600
01:19:46,093 --> 01:19:49,957
我再也不想跟他和他的生活有任何关系
I didn't want to do anything to do with him or his sick life.

601
01:19:50,678 --> 01:19:55,593
而他就在断气之前 却让你来找我
And then with his dying breath, he sends me you.

602
01:19:56,604 --> 01:19:58,035
真讽刺啊 不是吗？
Ironic, no?

603
01:19:58,165 --> 01:20:00,648
你不该对他这么狠
You shouldn't be so hard on him.

604
01:20:00,788 --> 01:20:03,991
他本来早几周前就要死的
And now that I've just mentioned, he would have been dead weeks ago.

605
01:20:04,121 --> 01:20:07,014
硬撑着没咽气就是为了你啊
The reason his heart was still beating was because of you.

606
01:20:08,075 --> 01:20:11,649
我会抽时间去看我的父亲 邦德先生
I mourn my father in my own time, Mr. Bond.

607
01:20:12,169 --> 01:20:14,932
现在我要去睡觉了
And now, I'm going to bed.

608
01:20:21,779 --> 01:20:26,314
休想有一丝邪念 你以为我会因为父亲死了
Don't think for one moment, this is where I fall into your arms.

609
01:20:26,514 --> 01:20:30,698
就会对你投怀送抱 寻求精神慰藉吗？
Seeking solace for my dead daddy.

610
01:20:34,152 --> 01:20:39,987
你给我坐那儿 好好站岗 那是你最擅长的了
You sit there, keep watch. That's what you're good at.

611
01:20:43,831 --> 01:20:46,674
你胆敢靠近我一步 我就杀了你
Come anywhere near me and I will kill you.

612
01:20:46,934 --> 01:20:49,057
这我毫不怀疑
I don't doubt it.

613
01:20:59,177 --> 01:21:02,130
快看 那儿有两个你
Look, there are 2 of you.

614
01:21:03,651 --> 01:21:08,566
有两个詹姆斯 我可真幸运
Two James. Lucky me.

615
01:21:12,354 --> 01:21:14,566
我在这里做什么

616
01:21:23,654 --> 01:21:26,066
致骗子

617
01:21:26,161 --> 01:21:28,566
和杀手

618
01:21:28,751 --> 01:21:30,566
致骗子

619
01:21:30,951 --> 01:21:32,466
和杀手

620
01:21:32,951 --> 01:21:34,554
他们无所不在

621
01:22:05,774 --> 01:22:09,077
谁派你来的？
Who sent you?

622
01:22:11,860 --> 01:22:14,352
你在替谁卖命？
Who are you working for?

623
01:22:51,119 --> 01:22:54,223
你到底躲哪儿了？
Now, where did you go?

624
01:23:22,331 --> 01:23:23,993
果然
Of course!

625
01:24:37,357 --> 01:24:40,110
"与维丝帕·林德对谈"
"VESPER LYND INTERROGATION"

626
01:24:47,046 --> 01:24:48,728
那是什么？
What is it?

627
01:24:51,120 --> 01:24:52,842
没设么
Nothing.

628
01:25:06,986 --> 01:25:08,468
这是什么？
What's this?

629
01:25:09,208 --> 01:25:10,640
这些是坐标
Coordinates.

630
01:25:13,903 --> 01:25:18,348
你父亲当时在扫描某个卫星电话 他在找某个人
Your father was scanning for a particular satellite, looking for someone.

631
01:25:20,210 --> 01:25:22,522
他找的是这个人
He was looking for him.

632
01:25:23,843 --> 01:25:26,946
他是让我来完成他的工作
And he sent me here to finish the job.

633
01:25:28,498 --> 01:25:30,810
- 我要跟你一起去 - 不 你别去
- I'm coming with you. - No, you're not.

01:25:31,361 --> 01:25:34,494

- I'd like you alive. - I can look after myself.

635
01:25:34,594 --> 01:25:36,396
这个并不是重点
That's beside the point.

636
01:25:37,697 --> 01:25:40,640
- 我可能有去无回 - 我知道
- I might not be coming back. - I know.

637
01:25:41,901 --> 01:25:44,924
但我想知道我父亲究竟遭遇了什么
But I want to understand what happened to my father.

638
01:26:03,403 --> 01:26:05,655
说吧 他是去什么地方？
So, where was he going?

639
01:26:08,708 --> 01:26:10,720
不毛之地
Nowhere.

640
01:26:26,116 --> 01:26:26,787
这是怎么回事
What's going on?

641
01:26:26,907 --> 01:26:28,618
会议提前了 你没收到信息吗？
Well a meeting was brought forward, did you not get the message?

642
01:26:28,739 --> 01:26:29,920
根本就没收到
No, we didn't.

643
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:33,273
- 这是史上最短的会了 - 难道南非也同意了？
- Shortest meeting I can remember. - South Africa's on board.

644
01:26:33,313 --> 01:26:34,975
对 是啊 他们也只能如此了
Yeah, well. Who can blame them?

645
01:26:35,015 --> 01:26:37,147
九只眼协议现在正式生效了

646
01:26:37,207 --> 01:26:40,070
新系统72小时内就启动

这可是向前了一大步
A major step forward.

648
01:26:42,132 --> 01:26:43,874
全球性的情报合作将改变一切
Global Intelligence Corporation changes everythi...

649
01:26:43,894 --> 01:26:45,576
你之前说过了
As, you've said before.

650
01:26:47,507 --> 01:26:53,764
- 听着 他们让我来领导这个委员会 - 当然 然后呢？
Look, they've asked me to hold the new committee - Yes. And?

651
01:26:53,784 --> 01:26:56,977
我得跟你说 我已经跟内政大臣谈过了
And I should tell you I've spoken with the Home Secretary.

652
01:26:57,297 --> 01:27:00,090
鉴于我给他的新信息
And in light of the new information I have given him.

653
01:27:00,140 --> 01:27:03,343
他决定立即停止00特工计划
He's decided to close down the 00 Program with immediate effect.

654
01:27:03,754 --> 01:27:08,649
- 你知道你在做什么吗？ - 不是针对你个人的 那是未来所在
- You don't know what you're doing. - It's not personal. It's the future.

655
01:27:08,989 --> 01:27:10,100
而你
And...

656
01:27:13,053 --> 01:27:16,166
- 你已经过时了 - 你丫不要太狂啊
You're not - You're a cocky little bastard, aren't you?

657
01:27:18,068 --> 01:27:21,271
- 我就当你在夸我 - 想得美
- I'll take that as a compliment. - I wouldn't.

658
01:27:22,242 --> 01:27:24,375
这事儿还没完呢
This isn't over yet.

659
01:27:41,892 --> 01:27:43,924
- 帮我熨下好吗？ - 好的先生
- Will you press this for me? - Yes, sir.

660
01:28:04,355 --> 01:28:05,826
拿起来
Pick it up.

661
01:28:06,967 --> 01:28:08,229
我讨厌枪
I hate guns.

662
01:28:08,759 --> 01:28:11,182
我答应过你爸要保护你的
I promised him I'd protect you.

663
01:28:11,382 --> 01:28:14,305
所以第一件事就是教你保护自己
The first thing to do is to teach you how to protect yourself.

664
01:28:14,365 --> 01:28:18,579
- 我要是误伤了你怎么办？ - 误伤又不是第一次了
- What if I shoot you be mistake? - Wouldn't be the first time.

665
01:28:19,330 --> 01:28:22,463
- 拿起来 - 我说了我讨厌枪
- Pick it up. - I said I hate guns.

666
01:28:28,269 --> 01:28:32,003
这是西格226 前准星 后瞄准器 击锤
SIG-226, front side rear side, hammer.

667
01:28:38,459 --> 01:28:42,523
你只需要瞄准 扣动扳机 尽量不要闭眼
You just point it, squeeze the trigger and try not to close your eyes.

668
01:28:43,704 --> 01:28:47,158
听我的 试试吧
Please, try it.

669
01:29:11,623 --> 01:29:14,415
看来你已经无师自通了啊
I don't have to teach you anything, do I?

670
01:29:16,267 --> 01:29:19,581
曾经有个男的来我家要杀我父亲
A man once came to our house to kill my father.

671
01:29:20,081 --> 01:29:23,324
可他不知道我就在楼上卧室里玩儿
He didn't know I was upstairs playing in my bedroom.

672
01:29:23,525 --> 01:29:27,719
也不知道我爸在水池下藏了一把9毫米的伯莱塔
Papa kept a Beretta 9mm under the sink with the bleach.

673
01:29:31,162 --> 01:29:33,435
所以我特别痛恨枪
That's why I hate guns.

674
01:29:34,436 --> 01:29:37,479
看来也能跳过徒手格斗教学了
I think we'll skip hand-to-hand combat.

675
01:29:55,016 --> 01:29:57,238
晚上好长官 抱歉打断您的晚餐
Evening, sir. Sorry to interrupt your supper.

676
01:29:57,248 --> 01:29:59,321
- 我们刚收到新消息 - 晚上好长官
- But we have some news. - Evening, sir.

677
01:30:00,021 --> 01:30:05,196
通过使用"智能血液" 我们已经追踪到了邦德 他人在北非
Using the Smart Blood, I've tracked Bond to a point here. In North Africa.

678
01:30:06,308 --> 01:30:09,961
- 现在所有地图都指向那片沙漠 - 没错 但您看这儿
The everyday map, registers it as an empty desert - Exactly, but if you look

679
01:30:10,061 --> 01:30:13,084
卫星放大图像却能看到这个
with a satellite blow up, we can clearly see this.

680
01:30:13,215 --> 01:30:14,896
我们帮不了他
I can't help him.

681
01:30:15,917 --> 01:30:18,150
但我们知道他要去哪儿
But, sir. We know where he's heading.

682
01:30:19,191 --> 01:30:23,575
C正监视我们的一举一动 这么做只会给他白送情报
C is watching everything we do. We're only handing them more information.

683
01:30:27,028 --> 01:30:31,653
- 长官 我们不能这样抛弃邦德 - 无能为力 他只能被削弱
- Sir, we can't just desert Bond. - We have to, we only make him weaker.

684
01:30:31,703 --> 01:30:34,056
- 可我们知道他在哪儿啊 - 这我明白
- Sir, you know exactly where he is. - Yes, I know,

685
01:30:34,066 --> 01:30:36,348
我们能追踪他 别人也一样可以
If we can track him, so can others.

686
01:30:36,558 --> 01:30:40,702
给我删除所有"智能血液"相关文件 要不留痕迹
Delete all the Smart Blood files, everything.

687
01:30:42,404 --> 01:30:44,116
他只有靠自己了
He's on his own.

688
01:31:10,202 --> 01:31:13,856
- 盯着多不合适啊 - 天啊 这是同一个人吗
- You shouldn't stare. - Well, you shouldn't look like that.

689
01:31:17,810 --> 01:31:20,773
- 帮你点杯开胃酒吧 - 还没想好呢
- May I get you a cup of tea? - I'm not sure.

690
01:31:20,973 --> 01:31:24,056
我喝酒可会惹麻烦 会让我做出格的事
Gets me into trouble, makes me do crazy things.

691
01:31:24,296 --> 01:31:29,842
- 那样可不行啊 - 所以我就来伏特加马提尼 加点刺激
- Well, we can't have that. - So, I'll have Vodka Martini, dirty.

692
01:31:29,902 --> 01:31:31,543
我也来那个
Make that two.

693
01:31:34,857 --> 01:31:37,940
- 我有个问题 - 什么问题？
- I have a question. - What's that?

694
01:31:38,030 --> 01:31:41,233
为什么有那么多职业可供选择
Why given any other possible option,

695
01:31:41,353 --> 01:31:43,796
偏有人要当职业杀手呢？
does a man choose a life of a paid assassin?

696
01:31:43,906 --> 01:31:46,278
不当杀手 当牧师怎么样？
It was either that or being a priest.

697
01:31:47,860 --> 01:31:49,461
我可是认真的
I'm serious.

698
01:31:49,782 --> 01:31:52,795
这就是你想要的吗？ 整天躲在阴影之中
Is this really what you want? Living in the shadows?

699
01:31:52,875 --> 01:31:55,518
追杀别人 或被别人追杀
Hunting, being hunted.

700
01:31:55,708 --> 01:31:58,921
背后总有人盯着你 一直是孤独一人
Always looking behind you, always alone?

701
01:31:59,151 --> 01:32:01,063
可我并不孤独
No, I'm not alone.

702
01:32:01,093 --> 01:32:02,805
你先回答我的问题
Answer the question.

703
01:32:03,996 --> 01:32:06,549
我不知道自己是否有得可选
I'm not sure I ever had a choice.

704
01:32:07,910 --> 01:32:10,042
但我也不会专门想这个问题
Anyway, I don't stop to think about it.

705
01:32:10,132 --> 01:32:12,304
你如果想了会怎样？
What would happen if you did?

706
01:32:12,985 --> 01:32:15,798
- 专门去想吗？ - 是的
- Stop? - Yes

707
01:32:19,532 --> 01:32:21,253
我不知道
I don't know.

708
01:32:21,344 --> 01:32:25,097
- 这是您的酒 先生 - 请先放那里吧
- Your drinks, sir. - Could you leave them there please?

709
01:32:36,879 --> 01:32:39,011
知道吗 我觉得你错了
You know, I think you're wrong.

710
01:32:39,442 --> 01:32:40,923
我错了吗？
I am?

711
01:32:41,974 --> 01:32:44,337
每个人都会有选择
We always have a choice.

712
01:32:46,649 --> 01:32:48,331
就为这个干一杯
I'll drink to that.

713
01:35:36,570 --> 01:35:38,032
该死
Shit!

714
01:35:45,659 --> 01:35:47,201
现在该干什么
What do we do now?

715
01:36:47,061 --> 01:36:49,373
这样估计要等很久
This might be a long way.

716
01:36:51,295 --> 01:36:53,387
你要不要重新考虑下？
Are you having a second thought?

717
01:36:54,258 --> 01:36:55,960
为时已晚了
Too late now.

718
01:37:15,109 --> 01:37:16,701
那是什么？
What's that?

719
01:37:31,926 --> 01:37:37,372
那车 可是1948年产的劳斯莱斯银魅
That is a 1948 Rolls Royce Silver Wraith.

720
01:38:01,016 --> 01:38:02,857
请上车
Please.

721
01:38:24,910 --> 01:38:26,731
我很害怕 詹姆斯
I'm scared, James.

722
01:39:10,225 --> 01:39:13,559
下午好 邦德先生 斯旺医生
Good afternoon, Mr. Bond. Dr. Swann

723
01:39:13,639 --> 01:39:17,352
终于能见到你们 我们都深感荣幸
I want you to know just how excited we all are to finally meet you.

724
01:39:17,392 --> 01:39:20,375
我们也很高兴能来
Well, it's a pleasure to be here.

725
01:39:20,456 --> 01:39:25,581
主人想请你们先休息放松一下 四点的时候会请你们喝一杯
Your host invites you both to rest, relax and meet him for drinks at 4:00.

726
01:39:25,891 --> 01:39:28,093
- 转告你主人 我们会准时到 - 好极了
- Tell our host, we won't be late. - Wonderful!

727
01:39:28,414 --> 01:39:31,947
带你们去房间前 还有一件事情
Before we show you to your rooms, just one more thing.

728
01:39:42,758 --> 01:39:45,060
你可要小心点
You be careful with that.

729
01:39:45,341 --> 01:39:46,972
它已经上膛了
It's loaded.

730
01:39:53,229 --> 01:39:54,750
谢谢
Thank you.

731
01:40:53,739 --> 01:40:56,442
这是个非常特别的地方
This is a very special place.

732
01:40:56,472 --> 01:40:59,465
主人已要求我们 只能你们独自进去
He has requested, you enter it alone.

733
01:41:00,236 --> 01:41:01,517
没问题
Of course.

734
01:41:04,190 --> 01:41:05,481
来杯香槟吗？
Champagne?

735
01:41:06,703 --> 01:41:08,815
要不再等会儿？
Maybe later.

736
01:41:08,965 --> 01:41:10,707
当然可以
Certainly.

737
01:41:41,628 --> 01:41:44,070
我想我们该表现出惊叹的样子
They say we're meant to be impressed.

738
01:41:57,153 --> 01:41:58,795
摸摸看
Touch it.

739
01:42:00,296 --> 01:42:02,459
你想摸 但摸无妨
Touch it if you want.

740
01:42:04,611 --> 01:42:08,114
- 知道这是什么吗？ - 这是块陨石
- Do you know what it is? - It's a meteorite.

741
01:42:09,125 --> 01:42:11,308
是的 没错
Yes, exactly!

742
01:42:11,808 --> 01:42:15,632
卡腾霍夫 人类已有的最古老陨石
Kartenhoff, the oldest in human possession.

743
01:42:16,313 --> 01:42:19,866
是它在地球上留下了这个陨石坑
The very meteorite that made this crater.

744
01:42:21,097 --> 01:42:22,179
试想一下
Think about it.

745
01:42:23,029 --> 01:42:27,294
先前那么多年里
So many years up there alone, silent.

746
01:42:27,684 --> 01:42:32,279
它是那么孤独而寂静 一直在积聚动能 最终在地球上留下印记
Building momentum until it chose to make its mark on Earth.

747
01:42:33,570 --> 01:42:36,643
它是股不可阻挡的巨大力量
Huge unstoppable force.

748
01:42:36,653 --> 01:42:38,815
但他最终还是停下来了 不是吗？
Except it did stop, didn't it?

749
01:42:39,516 --> 01:42:40,897
停在了这儿
Right here.

750
01:42:55,472 --> 01:42:59,186
你都不知道我期待这一刻有多久了
I can't tell you how much I have been looking forward to this.

751
01:42:59,376 --> 01:43:02,139
我们所有人重聚在一起
All of us here, together.

752
01:43:04,391 --> 01:43:06,633
一个小团圆
A reunion.

753
01:43:08,345 --> 01:43:11,578
很高兴你也来了 亲爱的玛德琳
So glad you came too, dear Madeleine.

754
01:43:12,769 --> 01:43:16,133
我第一次见到你时 你还是个小女孩
You were just a girl, when I saw you first.

755
01:43:16,994 --> 01:43:20,547
有次我去你家找你父亲
I came to your home once to see your father.

756
01:43:22,579 --> 01:43:24,802
我不记得了
I don't remember that.

757
01:43:25,542 --> 01:43:27,344
可我记得
But I do.

758
01:43:31,528 --> 01:43:33,380
请吧
Shall we?

759
01:43:36,714 --> 01:43:38,605
这是什么地方？
What is this place?

760
01:43:38,656 --> 01:43:40,447
和情报有关
Information.

761
01:43:43,350 --> 01:43:45,753
情报就是一切
Information is all.

762
01:43:46,593 --> 01:43:48,215
不是吗？
Is it not?

763
01:43:49,036 --> 01:43:50,356
比如说
For example..

764
01:43:50,368 --> 01:43:54,952
你现在应该知道00计划已经寿终正寝了
You must know by now, that the 00 Program is officially dead.

765
01:43:55,803 --> 01:44:00,127
这让我不禁好奇你为何而来
Which leaves me to speculate, why you came?

766
01:44:02,740 --> 01:44:06,113
我说詹姆斯 你为何而来？
So, James. Why did you come?

767
01:44:06,303 --> 01:44:08,185
我来这是为了杀了你
I came here to kill you.

768
01:44:08,886 --> 01:44:11,499
而我认为你是来送死
And I thought you came here to die.

769
01:44:11,619 --> 01:44:17,445
- 只是看问题的角度不同罢了 - 既然说到看问题的角度
- It's all the matter of perspective. - Speaking of perspective,

770
01:44:34,802 --> 01:44:39,016
- 这是直播吗？ - 实时画面 格林尼治时间十六点二十分
- Is this live? - Live and direct, 16:20 GMT.

771
01:44:39,337 --> 01:44:41,599
真是无巧不成书啊
What an uncanny coincidence.

772
01:44:41,819 --> 01:44:43,531
法语有一句谚语
The French have a saying:

773
01:44:43,571 --> 01:44:46,384
"玻璃的宿命就是破碎"
"It's the faith of glass to break."

774
01:44:46,444 --> 01:44:50,588
看来也许间谍的宿命 就是消失
Well, maybe it's just the faith of spies to just disappear.

775
01:44:50,618 --> 01:44:54,882
不过幸运的是 我们有所成就
But with any luck, we leave something behind.

776
01:44:55,112 --> 01:44:58,996
与此同时 C会继续出色领导大家的工作
In the meantime, I'm sure C will keep you all busy.

777
01:44:59,297 --> 01:45:01,589
谢谢大家
Thank you all.

778
01:45:04,242 --> 01:45:08,646
真是感人 你不觉得吗？
It's touching, don't you think?

779
01:45:10,478 --> 01:45:12,550
可惜啊詹姆斯
Poor old, James.

780
01:45:13,091 --> 01:45:15,013
你成了被遗忘的角落
It looks like you're all alone.

781
01:45:15,393 --> 01:45:18,226
你难道只是个偷窥狂吗？
Not much more than a bore are you?

782
01:45:19,097 --> 01:45:21,528
胆小到不敢加入我们
Too scared to join in?

783
01:45:21,540 --> 01:45:24,602
- 看来你还没明白 - 不 我很明白
- I don't think you quite understand. - I think I do.

784
01:45:24,692 --> 01:45:28,606
你策划那几个城市的袭击 伤及无辜 就是逼人就范
You set cities on fire, watch innocent people burn so you can convince

785
01:45:28,616 --> 01:45:32,220
让那些政府加入你操盘的情报网络
governments to join the intelligence network you paid for.

786
01:45:32,530 --> 01:45:33,771
整件事并不复杂
Not that complicated

787
01:45:35,053 --> 01:45:39,577
我猜我们的小朋友C 他该是你的门徒之一吧
I'm guessing out little friend, C, is one of your disciples?

788
01:45:40,278 --> 01:45:42,110
就算是吧
You could say that.

789
01:45:42,240 --> 01:45:44,152
他会得到什么好处？
What does he get out of it?

790
01:45:44,662 --> 01:45:45,804
什么都没有
Nothing?

791
01:45:46,624 --> 01:45:50,608
- 他和我都能看得很远 - 看得远的人
- He's a visionary, like me. - Visionary, I see.

792
01:45:50,999 --> 01:45:52,891
精神病院里多的是
Psychiatry wards are full of them.

793
01:45:52,971 --> 01:45:55,904
而你连眼前都看不清
Where as you can see what's right in front of you.

794
01:45:55,934 --> 01:45:59,567
我们交手那么多次 你却从来没发现过我
You came across me so many times and yet you never saw me.

795
01:46:00,438 --> 01:46:03,822
- 拉契夫 格林 席尔瓦 - 他们都死了
- Le Chiffre, Greene, Silva... - All dead.

796
01:46:04,372 --> 01:46:05,483
没错
That's right.

797
01:46:05,724 --> 01:46:08,086
你我之间有种模式
A nice pattern developed, you interfere

798
01:46:08,106 --> 01:46:10,258
你侵犯我的世界 我就毁掉你的世界
my world, I destroy yours.

799
01:46:12,460 --> 01:46:17,385
你觉得你生命中所有女人最后都死了是种巧合吗？
Or did you think it was coincidence that all the women in your life ended up dead?

800
01:46:17,896 --> 01:46:20,899
就拿维斯帕·林德来说
Vesper Lynd, for example.

801
01:46:21,740 --> 01:46:25,023
这位算是举足轻重的吧 他没跟你说起过吗？
She was the big one, has he told you about her?

802
01:46:27,425 --> 01:46:31,389
当然还有这位 你最亲爱的M夫人
An then of course, your beloved M.

803
01:46:31,550 --> 01:46:34,452
也永远离开了你
Gone forever.

804
01:46:37,275 --> 01:46:39,377
是我
Me...

805
01:46:40,649 --> 01:46:42,901
全都是我干的 詹姆斯
It was always me, James.

806
01:46:42,981 --> 01:46:47,776
这些都源于我 你所有痛苦都是我写就的
It's always been me. The author of all your pain.

807
01:46:50,369 --> 01:46:53,241
你是个勇敢的女人 亲爱的
You're a brave woman, my dear.

808
01:46:59,908 --> 01:47:03,702
我终于明白我父亲为什么会疯了
Now I understand why my father lost his mind.

809
01:47:03,742 --> 01:47:06,545
他没有疯 他就是软弱
He didn't lose his mind, he was just weak.

810
01:47:06,675 --> 01:47:09,778
但他起码知道他是在与谁为敌
But at least he understood, what he was up against.

811
01:47:09,988 --> 01:47:12,311
他们不能理解的一个残酷事实是
Comprehended a crucial fact that.

812
01:47:12,611 --> 01:47:15,994
一个可怕的事件也会催生完美的事物
A terrible event, can lead to something wonderful.

813
01:47:18,477 --> 01:47:21,420
既然说到你父亲 不妨让你也看看
Since you mentioned you father, I'll show you.

814
01:47:21,560 --> 01:47:26,195
她相当聪明 她比我聪明 知道怎么躲起来
She's clever, she's smarter than me. She knows how to hide.

815
01:47:26,225 --> 01:47:30,499
说出那人在哪 我就能保护你女儿
And I'm going to protect her if you tell me where he is.

816
01:47:33,011 --> 01:47:35,893
- 我能保住她的命 - 好啊
- I can keep her alive. - Yeah.

817
01:47:35,894 --> 01:47:35,904
You have my word - I can keep her alive. Yeah.

818
01:47:35,905 --> 01:47:37,236
我向你承诺
You have my word.

819
01:47:37,266 --> 01:47:39,598
不不不 快关掉
No, no, no, no, no. Turn this off.

820
01:47:39,758 --> 01:47:41,350
你向我承诺？
Word?

821
01:47:41,460 --> 01:47:42,901
一个杀手也能信？
The word of an assassin?

822
01:47:42,921 --> 01:47:43,952
马上给我关掉
Turn this off!

823
01:47:44,303 --> 01:47:47,306
- 这一段很重要 - 我说了马上关掉
- This is important. - I said turn it off!

824
01:47:49,068 --> 01:47:52,011
我想让你明白一件事
I want you to understand something.

825
01:48:01,040 --> 01:48:03,933
说到做到
That's my word

826
01:48:04,013 --> 01:48:05,214
玛德琳
Madeleine.

827
01:48:05,804 --> 01:48:07,696
看着我
Look at me.

828
01:48:08,527 --> 01:48:12,581
别看他 玛德琳 看着我
Don't look at him, Madeleine. Look at me.

829
01:48:13,833 --> 01:48:15,374
"美国人"
American.

830
01:48:16,465 --> 01:48:21,610
你只要能救她 她就能带你去"美国人"那儿 她非常了解
You save her, she can lead you to the American. She knows the American.

831
01:48:24,704 --> 01:48:26,976
先去霍夫勒诊所看看
Try the Chauffeur Clinic.

832
01:48:32,972 --> 01:48:38,097
你现在就是只风筝 在飓风中飞舞的风筝 邦德先生
You're a kite dancing in a hurricane, Mr. Bond.

833
01:48:40,539 --> 01:48:42,541
永别了
So long.

834
01:48:48,367 --> 01:48:52,722
那些能把人聚到一起的事情
Things that bring people together.

835
01:48:56,135 --> 01:48:59,479
也许是恐惧 也许是美
Out of horror, beauty.

836
01:49:24,223 --> 01:49:28,408
肉体折磨太简单了 流于肤浅
Torture is an easy and efficient way.

837
01:49:28,458 --> 01:49:31,911
一个人可以看着自己被开膛
A man can watch himself being disemboweled.

838
01:49:32,061 --> 01:49:35,745
从中会产生出巨大恐惧
Surprise brings horror to the experience.

839
01:49:35,875 --> 01:49:38,918
但这种折磨远未触及其灵魂
It can go over a distance, it isn't taking

840
01:49:38,978 --> 01:49:40,480
仍没有触及到他的真正内心
place where he is.

841
01:49:41,661 --> 01:49:44,353
你应该很清楚 亲爱的玛德琳
You know all too well, my dear Madeleine.

842
01:49:44,354 --> 01:49:46,966
真正的他存在于他的大脑之中
A man lives inside his head.

843
01:49:47,637 --> 01:49:51,040
那里才安放着他的灵魂
That's where the seed of the soul is.

844
01:49:52,142 --> 01:49:57,487
最近我和詹姆斯同时目睹一个人刚被挖去双眼
James and I were both present recently. When a man was deprived of his eyes.

845
01:49:57,857 --> 01:50:02,762
接着一件最令人震惊的事情发生了
And the most astonishing thing happened, didn't you notice?

846
01:50:03,022 --> 01:50:05,075
你注意到了吗？ 他的灵魂已经不在了
He wasn't there anymore.

847
01:50:05,495 --> 01:50:08,188
他虽然还活着 可灵魂已死
He's gone even though, he's alive.

848
01:50:08,228 --> 01:50:11,191
就在生与死的那一瞬间
This brief moment between life and death.

849
01:50:11,811 --> 01:50:14,884
他脑海里再没有任何人
There was nobody inside his skull.

850
01:50:15,555 --> 01:50:17,897
真是奇妙
Most odd.

851
01:50:19,559 --> 01:50:21,551
那么 詹姆斯
So, James.

852
01:50:22,702 --> 01:50:29,299
我现在要渗透进你的大脑
I'm going to penetrate to where you are.

853
01:50:29,495 --> 01:50:32,272
去触及你的灵魂所在 探索你的脑部世界
To the inside of you head.

854
01:50:32,712 --> 01:50:36,396
这第一根探针会玩弄你的视觉 你的听觉
The first probe will play with your sight.

855
01:50:36,502 --> 01:50:39,813
还有平衡感
Curing your balance.

856
01:50:39,960 --> 01:50:45,175
- 只需要最轻微的操作即可 - 那你就尽管来吧
- Just with a subtlest manipulation. - Get on with it then.

857
01:50:45,631 --> 01:50:49,075
没什么能比听你啰嗦更痛苦了
Nothing can be as painful as listening to you talk.

858
01:50:49,743 --> 01:50:51,461
那好吧
Alright.

859
01:50:51,932 --> 01:50:53,944
我们开始
Let's begin!

860
01:51:26,006 --> 01:51:28,238
你为什么要这么做？
Why are we doing this?

861
01:51:41,114 --> 01:51:46,236
你应该知道 詹姆斯很小的时候就失去了双亲
You probably know that, James here lost his parents when he was young.

862
01:51:48,535 --> 01:51:54,305
但你知道吗 后来是我父亲 陪他度过最艰难的时光
But did you know that it was my father who helped him out through his difficult times?

863
01:52:01,962 --> 01:52:08,929
一连两个冬天 我父亲教他滑雪 教他登山 还有打猎
Over the course of 2 winters, he taught him to ski, climb and hunt.

864
01:52:09,075 --> 01:52:14,385
他为这位蓝眼珠的可怜孤儿抚平了心灵创伤
He soothe the wound of the poor little blue eyed orphan.

865
01:52:16,137 --> 01:52:18,872
还让我把他当做自己的兄弟
Asked me to treat him as a brother.

866
01:52:19,273 --> 01:52:20,821
把他当做小弟弟看
My little brother.

867
01:52:22,329 --> 01:52:25,536
我们之间结下了深厚情谊
They formed quite an attachment.

868
01:52:26,307 --> 01:52:30,401
所以 你选择把他杀了
No, you killed him.

869
01:52:30,817 --> 01:52:32,903
没错 那是我干的
Yes, I did.

870
01:52:35,969 --> 01:52:41,695
你们应该能猜到 布谷鸟为了在别的鸟巢产卵会怎么做
You know what happens when a Cuckoo hatches inside another bird's nest?

871
01:52:45,086 --> 01:52:48,755
- 我知道 它会把别的蛋推出巢外 - 没错
- It's forced to steal the eggs out. - Yes.

872
01:52:48,862 --> 01:52:54,835
所以 这只布谷鸟让我意识到我的父亲必须死
Well, this Cuckoo made me realize my father's life had to end.

873
01:52:55,269 --> 01:52:58,139
可以说 我的所作所为是他逼的
In a way, he's responsible for the path I took.

874
01:52:58,205 --> 01:53:01,132
所以谢谢你 布谷
So, thank you. Cuckoo!

875
01:53:06,320 --> 01:53:09,570
能来点别的鸟叫吗？ 弗朗兹
Do you know any bird calls, Franz?

876
01:53:16,958 --> 01:53:18,930
你好 猫咪
Hello, pussy.

877
01:53:21,135 --> 01:53:24,659
弗朗兹·奥伯豪斯20年前就死了
Franz Oberhauser died 20 years ago, James.

878
01:53:24,792 --> 01:53:28,079
他跟他父亲 同时死于一场雪崩
In an avalanche, alongside his father.

879
01:53:28,796 --> 01:53:33,925
现在跟你说话的人 你脑子里想的这个人
The man you're talking to now, the man inside your head.

880
01:53:33,935 --> 01:53:36,788
叫恩内斯特·史戴弗·布鲁夫尔德
Is Ernst Stavro Blofeld.

881
01:53:37,018 --> 01:53:41,242
- 大有来头？ - 承袭自我母亲家族那边
- Fancy name? - My mother's bloodline.

882
01:53:42,393 --> 01:53:47,228
探针要是在脑内梭状回里扎对了地方
If the needle finds the correct spot in the circumvolutia spindle.

883
01:53:47,254 --> 01:53:49,203
你就谁也不认识了
You'll recognize no one.

884
01:53:49,470 --> 01:53:53,665
当然 你那些女人的脸互相换来换去也无妨
Of course, if this even changes a lot, huh, James.

885
01:53:54,969 --> 01:53:56,704
你会连她都不认识的
You won't know who she is.

886
01:53:56,744 --> 01:54:00,972
她只是你前往坟墓途中 看到的一张脸而已
Just another passing face on your way to the grave.

887
01:54:08,703 --> 01:54:12,153
他临死的时候会根本认不出你
He dies not knowing who you are.

888
01:54:13,641 --> 01:54:18,790
一个杀手的女儿 唯一能真正理解他的人
The daughter of an assassin, the only one who could have understood.

889
01:54:19,541 --> 01:54:20,835
可惜了
Shame.

890
01:54:57,739 --> 01:54:59,561
我爱你
I love you.

891
01:55:04,639 --> 01:55:07,839
那对蓝眼珠还认得出你吗？
Do those blue eyes still recognize you?

892
01:55:10,983 --> 01:55:14,586
到哪儿我都能认出你
I'd recognize you anywhere.

893
01:55:16,698 --> 01:55:18,330
我的手表
Watch.

894
01:55:33,121 --> 01:55:34,509
1分钟之后
One minute.

895
01:55:36,138 --> 01:55:38,440
只剩1分钟
One minute.

896
01:55:41,663 --> 01:55:43,615
他说什么了吗？
Did you say something?

897
01:55:43,625 --> 01:55:45,547
光阴似箭
I guess you did.

898
01:55:46,561 --> 01:55:49,858
- 什么？ - 光阴 似箭
- What? - Doesn't time fly...

899
01:55:50,032 --> 01:55:52,244
听不见 詹姆斯
I can't hear you, James.

900
01:55:54,076 --> 01:55:58,901
我说 真是时光飞逝啊
I said, "doesn't time fly"?

901
01:56:25,654 --> 01:56:26,989
去那边
There!

902
01:57:08,284 --> 01:57:09,898
我们该回家了
Let's go home.

903
01:57:25,994 --> 01:57:27,790
这事儿还没完呢
It's not over yet.

904
01:58:17,520 --> 01:58:21,905
- 我没听说过希尔德布兰德 - 这样才叫安全堡垒啊
- Nobody's ever heard of Hildebram. - That is the general idea of safe houses.

905
01:58:39,482 --> 01:58:42,325
- 这里能有多安全？ - 很快就能知道了
- Exactly how safe is this house? - We're about to find out.

906
01:58:46,422 --> 01:58:49,503
果然安全 你们在这等着
It's safe. A bit of wait.

907
01:58:53,002 --> 01:58:55,218
- 我是M - 玛德琳·斯旺
- I'm M. - Madeleine Swann.

908
01:58:55,268 --> 01:58:58,314
很高兴见到你 007 你有什么新消息？
Pleased to meet you. So, what do you have for me, 007?

909
01:58:58,992 --> 01:59:02,776
最近死亡的幽灵党头目 恩内斯特·史戴弗·布鲁夫尔德
The recently deceased head of SPECTRE, Ernst Stavro Blofeld

910
01:59:03,132 --> 01:59:07,671
以及他的情报部长 你的新搭档C
and chief of intelligence, your new best friend, C.

911
01:59:08,137 --> 01:59:12,326
马上就要接管他在我们眼皮子底下建的
Were about to take control of his very own global surveillance system that he built.

912
01:59:12,336 --> 01:59:14,958
- 那个强大的全球监控体系了 - 那最好抓紧时间
- Right here, in our own houses. - Then we'd better move.

913
01:59:14,998 --> 01:59:16,653
系统午夜就要启动了
The system goes online at midnight.

914
01:59:16,680 --> 01:59:19,829
他们要是得逞 幽灵党就会掌控一切
If that happens SPECTRE will have control of everything.

915
01:59:19,869 --> 01:59:22,183
你和我去会一会C
So, you and I will have a quiet word with C. While Q

916
01:59:22,195 --> 01:59:24,434
同时Q侵入系统 组织系统上线
hacks into the system and stops it getting online.

917
01:59:24,914 --> 01:59:27,237
- 那可不容易 - 他会有办法的
- It won't be easy. - He'll find a way.

918
01:59:27,291 --> 01:59:29,293
他一向如此
He always does.

919
01:59:33,497 --> 01:59:37,701
- 欢迎你归队 007 - 长官
- It's good to have you back 007 - Sir.

920
01:59:46,776 --> 01:59:51,235
- 詹姆斯 我办不到 - 我会回来找你的
- James, I can't. - I'll come back for you.

921
01:59:51,435 --> 01:59:55,069
- 等这一切结束之后 - 不 我做不到
- When it's all over. - I know I can't.

922
01:59:55,319 --> 01:59:59,883
- 你是不能待在这儿 还是 - 我不能再过这种生活
- You can't stay here or...? - I can't go back to this life.

923
02:00:00,004 --> 02:00:02,726
我也不想让你做出改变
And I'm not doing to ask you to change.

924
02:00:02,926 --> 02:00:04,808
你就是这种人
This is who you are.

925
02:00:07,077 --> 02:00:10,584
- 你是要跟我告别？ - 是的
- You're saying goodbye. - Yes.

926
02:00:12,963 --> 02:00:14,758
你保重
Take care.

927
02:00:16,593 --> 02:00:18,772
你是个好人 詹姆斯
You're a good man, James.

928
02:01:19,894 --> 02:01:21,619
黑进去了吗 Q？
Are you in yet, Q?

929
02:01:21,726 --> 02:01:24,399
还有好几层难搞的防火墙
Few layers of impenetrable layers to go but I think

930
02:01:24,422 --> 02:01:25,640
但我应该是有些进展了
I'm getting somewhere.

931
02:02:14,632 --> 02:02:17,122
- 他们看见我们了 - 倒车
- They've seen us. - Move back!

932
02:02:55,914 --> 02:02:57,722
走
Go!

933
02:03:08,166 --> 02:03:10,005
把他带进楼去
Get into the building!

934
02:03:10,235 --> 02:03:13,038
快走啊 走啊
Move. Move!

935
02:04:31,490 --> 02:04:34,573
快回去找到M 马上 两个都要抓到
Go back and find M, now! We need them both.

936
02:04:44,623 --> 02:04:47,403
被人监视的感觉不好吧
Not a good feeling being watched, is it?

937
02:04:51,963 --> 02:04:53,993
别告诉我这是你捣的鬼
Don't tell me you're responsible for this.

938
02:04:54,046 --> 02:04:56,115
哪有 是我的军需官Q
No, but my quartermaster is.

939
02:04:56,835 --> 02:04:59,035
他可不是一般的才华横溢
And he's extremely talented.

940
02:04:59,131 --> 02:05:03,910
做得漂亮 可你们没有意识到 你们已经被炒了
Bravo, but in case you haven't realized it. You two are out of a job.

941
02:05:04,456 --> 02:05:08,314
- 所以 你现在算是非法闯入 - 恐怕是你错判局势了 麦克斯
So you're trespassing - I'm afraid you've got the wrong end of the stick, Max.

942
02:05:08,354 --> 02:05:11,227
我们要阻止系统上线
We're going to stop this system going online.

943
02:05:11,277 --> 02:05:14,413
- 还要把你也送进去 - 未免无凭无据吧
- Then I'm going to bring you in. - On what grounds exactly?

944
02:05:14,493 --> 02:05:16,823
就凭你交友不慎
Poor taste in friends.

945
02:05:52,599 --> 02:05:54,651
放眼看看这个世界
Take a look at the world.

946
02:05:56,563 --> 02:05:58,164
一片混乱
Chaos!

947
02:05:58,871 --> 02:06:00,620
因为有像你这样的人
Because people like you.

948
02:06:00,873 --> 02:06:05,625
层层官僚和政客们才会毫无担当 终日无所作为
People pushes, politician are too spineless to deal which what needs to be done.

949
02:06:06,142 --> 02:06:10,056
所以我跟其他人结成联盟 要让权力能物尽其用
So, I made an alliance to put the power where it should be.

950
02:06:10,109 --> 02:06:15,041
现在你们打着民主政治的旗号 想让它胎死腹中
And now you want to throw it away for the sake of democracy.

951
02:06:15,795 --> 02:06:17,557
这是何等荒唐
Whatever the hell that is.

952
02:06:17,797 --> 02:06:20,266
令人费解 愚钝之极
How predictably moronic.

953
02:06:20,507 --> 02:06:23,800
但这不就是M毕生的使命吗？
But then isn't that what M stands for?

954
02:06:25,818 --> 02:06:27,674
愚蠢
Moron?

955
02:06:29,115 --> 02:06:32,409
那我们现在也清楚C先生的使命了
Now you know what C stands for.

956
02:06:35,682 --> 02:06:37,384
太大意了
Careless.

957
02:07:16,536 --> 02:07:18,075
拜托
Come on!

958
02:07:18,751 --> 02:07:20,817
不 不 不
No, no, no!

959
02:08:24,217 --> 02:08:27,174
你还真是一只不死鸟啊
You're a hard man to kill, Blofeld.

960
02:08:36,376 --> 02:08:39,326
但愿没让你疼得太厉害
I do hope that doesn't hurt too much.

961
02:08:39,553 --> 02:08:41,809
我的伤口会愈合的
Oh, my wounds will heal.

962
02:08:43,130 --> 02:08:45,222
可你的伤口呢？
What about yours?

963
02:08:46,744 --> 02:08:51,699
看看四周吧 詹姆斯 你的世界就剩下这些
Look around, James. Look! This is what's left of your world.

964
02:08:51,739 --> 02:08:56,524
你所代表的一切 你所信仰的一切 都化作乌有
Everything you ever stood for, everything you believed in. A ruin.

965
02:08:57,064 --> 02:08:59,176
我们干嘛在这儿？
Why am I here?

966
02:09:00,414 --> 02:09:04,812
- 你想我了？ - 并没有
- Did you miss me? - No.

967
02:09:11,212 --> 02:09:13,751
但我知道有人想你了
But I know someone who does!

968
02:09:21,929 --> 02:09:26,764
- 她人在哪儿？ - 那得靠你去找了
- Where is she? - That's for you to find out.

969
02:09:34,688 --> 02:09:38,276
三分钟后 这座大楼会被夷为平地
Three minutes, this building will be demolished.

970
02:09:38,306 --> 02:09:40,641
我轻易就能离开
Well, I can get out easily.

971
02:09:40,708 --> 02:09:42,940
而你得做出抉择
But you have a choice.

972
02:09:43,141 --> 02:09:45,823
是豁出命去救她
Die trying to save her, or.

973
02:09:46,024 --> 02:09:48,826
还是 自己保命活在痛苦之中
Save yourself and live with the pain.

974
02:09:49,223 --> 02:09:51,329
你在虚张声势
You're bluffing.

975
02:09:52,961 --> 02:09:54,352
我有吗？
Am I?

976
02:10:01,475 --> 02:10:04,532
我让你左右为难了吧？
I've really got you now haven't I?

977
02:10:05,346 --> 02:10:07,795
谁让我是你兄弟呢？
Oh, that's rather sweet.

978
02:10:07,996 --> 02:10:10,758
太了解如何操纵你了
They always know which button to press.

979
02:10:23,952 --> 02:10:25,443
玛德琳
Madeleine!

980
02:10:31,025 --> 02:10:34,202
拜托 拜托
Come on, come on.

981
02:10:35,616 --> 02:10:37,095
好的
Yes!

982
02:10:38,767 --> 02:10:42,500
- 走吧 - 你先请
Let's go. After you.

983
02:10:52,220 --> 02:10:54,683
为什么不正视现实 M？
Why can't you just face it, M?

984
02:10:56,718 --> 02:11:00,759
- 你没有存在价值了 - 我也许是没有
- You don't matter anymore. - Maybe I don't.

985
02:11:01,029 --> 02:11:02,203
但有些必须有
But something has to.

986
02:11:57,379 --> 02:11:59,488
- 死了 - 有邦德的消息吗？
- Dead. - Any word on Bond?

987
02:11:59,528 --> 02:12:01,716
没有 但我可以猜得到
No, but I'm starting to guess.

988
02:12:09,751 --> 02:12:11,310
玛德琳
Madeleine!

989
02:12:13,888 --> 02:12:15,534
玛德琳
Madeleine!

990
02:13:00,763 --> 02:13:03,192
- 你相信我吗？ - 我还有选择吗？
- Do you trust me? - Do I have a choice?

991
02:13:03,218 --> 02:13:05,004
想都别想
Not anymore.

992
02:13:15,257 --> 02:13:16,936
快点儿
Come on!

993
02:13:31,487 --> 02:13:33,493
别了 詹姆·斯邦德
Goodbye, James Bond.

994
02:16:45,496 --> 02:16:48,949
- 先生 这里是管制区域 - 马洛里 00计划部的
- Sir, there's a terrorist alert. - Mallory, 00 Section.

995
02:16:51,328 --> 02:16:53,304
解除戒备
Stand them down.

996
02:16:54,505 --> 02:16:58,069
E组 都别开火 解除戒备
The Go Team hold. Stand down.

997
02:17:33,975 --> 02:17:35,466
了结了吧
Finish it.

998
02:17:46,898 --> 02:17:48,720
快了结了吧
Finish it!

999
02:18:01,082 --> 02:18:02,303
没有子弹
Out of bullet.

1000
02:18:19,100 --> 02:18:23,364
而且现在 我还有更重要的事情要办
And besides, I've got something better to do.

1001
02:19:10,135 --> 02:19:12,737
根据2001年的《特殊措施法案》
Under the special measures act of 2001

1002
02:19:12,750 --> 02:19:15,547
我代表英国政府正式拘捕你
I'm detaining you on behalf of Her Majesty's government.

1003
02:20:21,634 --> 02:20:22,848
邦德
Bond?

1004
02:20:27,630 --> 02:20:30,072
- 你来这儿做什么？ - 早安 Q

- I thought you'd gone. - I had.

1006
02:20:41,994 --> 02:20:44,857
但我还缺一样东西
There's just one thing I need.
