96年時候

我在太空已經待了42天

knowing that Mrs. Kowalski was looking up, thinking of me.

這事你講過了  庫沃斯基

41
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:30,720
休士頓記得
As Houston recalls,

42
00:02:30,730 --> 00:02:33,340
她還開走了你那輛74年的GTO

請替我讚美工程組
Give my compliments to Engineering.

46
00:02:42,610 --> 00:02:45,490
除滾軸重定有點小故障外
Except for a slight malfunction in the nulling of the roll axis,

47
00:02:45,490 --> 00:02:48,430
這噴氣背包還真給力

48
00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:50,650
工程組說謝謝你

能確定些嗎
Could you be a little more specific?

60
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:19,710
休士頓最怕這種模糊估計
Indeterminate estimates make Houston anxious.

61
00:03:19,910 --> 00:03:22,650
休士頓  請不用擔心
No, no, no. Houston. Don't be anxious.

62
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:24,700
焦慮對心臟不好
Anxiety's not good for the heart.

63

系統已做好重啟準備

他好像在跳某種慶祝舞
He appears to be doing some form of the Macarena.

71
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:54,470
我也只能猜出這些了
But that would be just a best-guess scenario on my part.

72
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:56,350
斯通博士  這是休士頓

75
00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:06,030
-你有什麼感覺  -休士頓  我很好
- How are you feeling? - Houston, I'm fine.

76
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,420
只是零重力下
It's just keeping your lunch down

77
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:09,700
讓午飯待在胃裡可不容易
in zero-G is harder than it looks.

78
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:14,630
斯通博士  醫護組問你要不要回探索者號
Dr. Stone, Medical is asking if you want to return to Explorer.

79
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:16,590
不用  我們都來一周了  休士頓
Negative. We're been here a week, Houston.

80
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:17,930
趕快弄完吧

81
00:04:18,270 --> 00:04:21,900
-通信卡已啟動  -通信失敗
- Card is up. - No, that's a negative.

82
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:24,820
這邊沒有顯示  博士
I'll afraid we're getting nothing on this end, Doctor.

83
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:29,260
-重試  -還是沒有
- Try again. - No, still nothing.

84
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,880
休士頓  能把音樂關掉嗎
Houston, can you please turn that music off?

85
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:35,130

謝謝  庫沃斯基
Thank you, Kowalski.

88
00:04:42,390 --> 00:04:45,230
-現在呢  -還是不行
- Now, Houston? - That's a negative.

89
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,090
是不是休士頓讀取資料有誤
Could Houston be misinterpreting the data?

90
00:04:48,850 --> 00:04:51,040
我們沒有收到任何資料
Well, we're not receiving any data.

91
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:55,720
工程組建議目測一下元件是否受損
Engineering is recommending a vis-check for component damage.

92
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,600
我來看看
Let me see what's going on.

93
00:05:00,010 --> 00:05:01,210
怎麼回事
What have we got?

94
00:05:09,450 --> 00:05:12,120
目測未發現組件受損
Visual examination doesn't reveal any damaged components.

95
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:14,430
問題一定出在通信面板
The problem must be originating from the comms panel.

96
00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:17,070
是的  看來如此
Yeah, that seems to be the case.

97
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:20,780
工程組承認你之前警告過這種可能
Engineering admits that you warned us that this could happen.

98
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,930
就當作他們的道歉吧
That's as close to an apology as you're going to get from them.

99
00:05:23,930 --> 00:05:25,370
我們該聽取你的意見  博士
We should have listened to you, Doc.

100
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:28,650
-開始吧  -看來得臨場發揮了
- Get working. - Well, looks like we're going to have to improvise.

101
00:05:28,650 --> 00:05:32,700
-在試了  -你覺得要多久
- I'm on it. - How long do you think it'll take you?

102
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:36,220
-一小時  -很好
- One hour. - Outstanding.

103
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:37,040
在哈勃望遠鏡裡
Installing your system

104
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,980
安裝你的系統  是本次任務的目標
in the Hubble is the purpose of this mission

105
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:41,620
感謝你的耐心工作  博士
and so we appreciate your patience, Doctor.

106
00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:45,280
庫沃斯基  我們知道你不在意這個
Kowalski, we... we know you don't care about things like this,

107
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:46,590
也就告訴你一聲
but, uh, for your information,

108
00:05:46,590 --> 00:05:48,390
這次延遲還是不足以讓你打破
this delay is not gonna be long enough

109
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:51,490
阿納托利•索洛維約夫的太空行走紀錄
for you to break Anatoly Solovyev's spacewalking record.

110
00:05:51,490 --> 00:05:54,670
-看來還得有...-不就75分鐘嗎
- It seems like you're gonna be left... - Seventy-five minutes shy?

111
00:05:55,130 --> 00:05:56,850
誰稀罕這個啊
Never crossed my mind.

112
00:05:57,530 --> 00:06:00,820
馬特  和你合作真好
Matt... it's been a privilege.

113
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:03,150
彼此彼此  休士頓

感覺怎麼樣
How you feeling?

120
00:06:19,730 --> 00:06:22,040
就像吉娃娃被丟進甩幹桶
Like a Chihuahua that's being tumble-dried.

121
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:24,410
很難熬的一周
Well, it's been a rough week.

122
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:26,410
這麼說你可能感覺好點
If it makes you feel any better,

123
00:06:26,410 --> 00:06:27,450
我第一次來太空時
I coughed up everything

124
00:06:27,450 --> 00:06:30,050
差點把腎都吐出來
but my kidneys on my first ride.

125
00:06:30,930 --> 00:06:31,900
糟糕
Shit.

不好意思
Sorry.

127
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:42,560
我更習慣在醫院的地下實驗室
I'll used to a basement lab in a hospital

128
00:06:42,570 --> 00:06:45,760
東西都會掉在地上  謝謝
where things fall to the floor. Thank you.

129
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:50,140
你可是這裡的天才  我只是個開車的
Well, you're the genius up here. I only drive the bus.

130
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:52,560
別急著叫我天才
Yeah, well, call me a genius

131
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:55,030
先看我一小時能不能把面板初始化吧
if I can get this board initialized in the next hour.

132

395
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:09,240
我們終究躲不過殘片撞擊
We were gonna get hit no matter what.

396
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:11,280
你怎麼做都無濟於事

400
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:25,060
那邊
Over there.

401
00:23:26,910 --> 00:23:30,220
這路有點遠  但必須借助那邊的逃生艙
It's a bit of a hike, but we need to use their escape pod,

402
00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:32,240
聯盟號  才能返回地球

利用聯盟號飛船重返地球
and use one of their Soyuz for re-entry.

410
00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:09,290
空間站  能收到嗎
ISS, if you hear us...

411
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:12,080
我們亟需救援

412
00:24:26,470 --> 00:24:30,120
-氧量2%了  -快到了
- O2 down to two percent. - We're getting there.

八點樣子
eight PM.

427
00:25:23,710 --> 00:25:26,800

不知道
I don't know.

429
00:25:30,330 --> 00:25:32,610
我過不去了  會拖累你的
I'm not gonna make it. I'm slowing you down.

430
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:34,280
你平時這會兒都幹嘛

00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:02,840
聽國廣  古典音樂  還是爬行榜
NPR? Classical? Top forty?

438
00:26:06,420 --> 00:26:09,860
無所謂  只要主持人不廢話  我只管開車
Anything. I don't care, as long as they don't talk. I just drive.

-沒  -沒特別的人嗎
- No. - Nobody special?

443

沒人在地球上仰望天空  想著你嗎
Somebody down there looking up, thinking about you?

444
00:26:38,970 --> 00:26:39,950
萊恩
Ryan?

445
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:48,540
我曾有個女兒

446
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:00,830
那年她四歲
She was four.

447
00:27:03,810 --> 00:27:05,890
在學校捉迷藏
She was at school playing tag.

448
00:27:05,890 --> 00:27:08,190
滑倒撞了頭  就走了
Slipped, hit her head, and that was it.

449
00:27:11,030 --> 00:27:12,420
不堪回首

450
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:21,430
我開車時接的電話
I was driving when I got the call, so...

451
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,020
從那以後  我就成這樣了

氧氣降到1%了
O2 down to one percent.

456
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:16,370
我有個好消息  有個壞消息
Well, I've got good news and bad news.

457
00:28:16,570 --> 00:28:19,120
好消息是五分鐘就到空間站
The good news is, we're about five minutes from the ISS

458
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:21,460
我還知道老俄的伏特加藏在哪裡
and I know where the Russians stash their vodka.

459
00:28:21,790 --> 00:28:24,630
真好  我正缺杯酒提提神呢
And that is good, because I'm running on fumes here.

460
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:26,670
壞消息是  我還差十分鐘
The bad news is, I'm gonna be

461

就打破阿納托利的紀錄了
about ten minutes short of breaking Anatoly's record,

462
00:28:26,670 --> 00:28:29,430
{\an8}俄太空行走紀錄保持者

464
00:28:31,630 --> 00:28:33,670
-怎麼了  -我這裡報警了

465
00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:35,940
氧壓不夠
My O2 tank pressure is low.

466
00:28:35,990 --> 00:28:37,450
氧氣罐裡沒有了
Your tank is out of oxygen

467
00:28:37,450 --> 00:28:39,690
-但太空服裡還有  -好吧
- but you still have it in your suit. - Got it.

468
00:28:39,690 --> 00:28:41,350
慢慢呼吸  不要大口喘氣
So you have to sip, not gulp.

469
00:28:41,130 --> 00:28:42,920
{\an8}氧氣含量低

470
00:28:42,370 --> 00:28:43,770
當喝紅酒  不是啤酒
Wine, not beer.

471
00:28:43,770 --> 00:28:45,830
慢慢抿  萊恩
Sip, Ryan.

472
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:49,690
休士頓  能否通聯  我們已看到空間站
Houston, in the blind, we have a visual of the ISS.

473
00:28:49,690 --> 00:28:51,260
但人員肯定已撤離
The station must have been evacuated

474
00:28:51,260 --> 00:28:53,500
因為聯盟一號不見了
because the first Soyuz is missing.

475
00:28:53,570 --> 00:28:56,020
聯盟二號的表面嚴重受損
The second Soyuz exhibits surface damage,

476
00:28:56,020 --> 00:28:57,900
減速傘也打開了

477
00:28:58,030 --> 00:29:02,100
無法用作返回逃生艙
Any use as an escape pod for re-entry is impossible.

478
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:04,480
該變向了吧  又在漂了
Shouldn't we be turning? We're drifting again.

479
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:07,430
還不行  推進氣體我可沒開玩笑
Not yet. I wasn't kidding about those fumes.

480
00:29:07,430 --> 00:29:09,870
這罐還夠我們噴它一兩次
This can has one or two good thrusts left...

481
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:11,270
如果走運的話
if we're lucky.

482

穩住
Steady.

Fire!

485
00:29:44,180 --> 00:29:47,920
-減速  快減速  -不行  氣罐空了
Brake! Brake! You have to brake! - I can't, the can's empty.

486
00:29:48,170 --> 00:29:50,610
會狠狠撞上去  能抓什麼就抓什麼
We're gonna hit hard! Grab a hold of anything you can!

正在失去意識
You're losing consciousness.

530

聯盟二號受損嚴重  無法返回地球
That second Soyuz is too damaged for re-entry,

開著玩玩

00:34:01,990 --> 00:34:04,790
你要開著聯盟號溜達到那裡
You're gonna take the Soyuz, and you're gonna cruise over there.

537
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:08,590
中方救生艙叫神舟

-我可沒碰過神舟  -沒關係
- I've never flown a Shenzhou. - It doesn't matter.

539
00:34:12,580 --> 00:34:15,470
返地規程和聯盟號一樣
Its re-entry protocol is identical to the Soyuz.

540
00:34:20,010 --> 00:34:24,020

可我墜毀了
But I crashed it.

543
00:34:30,540 --> 00:34:33,020
模擬器可不就用來撞毀嘛
It's a simulator, that's what it's designed for.

544
00:34:36,170 --> 00:34:39,430
可是  我每次都墜毀
Every time. I crashed it every time.

545
00:34:39,620 --> 00:34:41,230
把那玩意對準地球就行了
You point the damn thing at Earth.

546
00:34:41,230 --> 00:34:42,780
一點不複雜

女孩子家怎麼叫萊恩呢

我想為自己祈禱  但從沒祈禱過
I mean, I'd say one for myself, but I'm never prayed in my life,

692
01:00:09,490 --> 01:00:10,440

Check your watch. Thirteen hours and eleven minutes.

707
01:03:48,610 --> 01:03:51,130

Call Anatoly and tell him he's been bumped.

708

It helps that I didn't have you around to distract me.

713
01:04:07,920 --> 01:04:10,700
不得不說  很高興再見到你

-找到伏特加了嗎  -你...

我們離開這鬼地方吧

720
01:04:39,740 --> 01:04:41,820
中國站離著大約100英里
The Chinese station's about a hundred miles.

721
01:04:41,860 --> 01:04:44,210
咱們來個陽光之旅吧
Just a little Sunday drive.

01:04:44,470 --> 01:04:46,060
-飛不了了  -飛的了

01:04:58,110 --> 01:05:00,150
都告訴過你  模擬器我都沒成功著陸過
I never got to land the simulator. I told you that.

729
01:05:00,150 --> 01:05:02,190

- But you know about it. - And I crashed it every time.

730
01:05:02,190 --> 01:05:04,890

Listen, do you want to go back, or do you want to stay here?

731

我懂了  太空很漂亮

你可以關掉所有系統

733
01:05:18,430 --> 01:05:19,790
關掉所有燈光

734
01:05:21,230 --> 01:05:23,530
閉上眼睛  忽略世人
and just close your eyes and tune out everybody.

735
01:05:24,570 --> 01:05:26,190
在太空沒人可以傷害你

736
01:05:27,240 --> 01:05:28,250
很安全
It's safe.

737
01:05:32,010 --> 01:05:34,290
為什麼要堅持  為什麼要活下去
I mean, what's the point of going on? What's the point of living?

738
01:05:39,460 --> 01:05:42,930
有什麼能比孩子的死還痛呢
Your kid died. Doesn't get any rougher than that.

739
01:05:45,760 --> 01:05:47,800
關鍵看你現在怎麼做
But still, it's a matter of what you do now.

740
01:05:49,790 --> 01:05:52,840
若決定回去  那就行動起來
If you decide to go, then you gotta just get on with it.

你要站在地球上

743
01:05:59,190 --> 01:06:00,510
開始新生活

754
01:07:40,050 --> 01:07:42,840
會在距地面三米自動開啟

755
01:07:45,970 --> 01:07:47,850
馬特  你他媽可真聰明
You're a clever son of a bitch, Matt.

756
01:07:48,110 --> 01:07:52,010

啟程
Here we go.

788
01:10:35,180 --> 01:10:37,060
天宮  你也在下降啊
You're losing altitude, Tiangong.

789
01:10:40,480 --> 01:10:43,350
這麼下降就要和氣層激情四射了
You keep dropping and you're gonna kiss the atmosphere.
