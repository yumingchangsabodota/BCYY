我明白这是你的第二次得此殊荣

你光荣的得到了它

00:03:34,381 --> 00:03:35,882
那就这些了？
So that's it?

12
00:03:36,425 --> 00:03:38,551
董事会的指令会很快到来

是的
Yes.

15
00:03:41,513 --> 00:03:42,763
那个放置炸弹的人呢？
And the Bomber?

16
00:03:45,017 --> 00:03:46,475
这已经不再是你需要考虑的问题了
It's not your problem anymore.

17
00:03:47,436 --> 00:03:48,728
我想我不需要提醒你
I don't need to remind you

18

你最终任务的重要性

那么请你先休息吧

<i>每个嫌疑犯告诫我们</i>

<i>让我们所作所为变得更好</i>

22
00:04:04,119 --> 00:04:07,163

<i>才是高效的</i>

24
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:11,334
<i>他能够精准的掌控时间</i>

25
00:04:12,336 --> 00:04:14,962
<i>媒体将其成为闪灭爆炸人</i>
<i>The press have dubbed him the Fizzle Bomber.</i>

26
00:04:16,048 --> 00:04:17,632
<i>我们这次阻止了他</i>

27
00:04:18,342 --> 00:04:20,635
<i>但这次只是一次小规模袭击</i>
<i>But this was only a small attack.</i>

28
00:04:23,972 --> 00:04:26,015
<i>这才是他的宏伟计划</i>
<i>This is his grand plan.</i>

29
00:04:27,184 --> 00:04:29,769
<i>1975年3月</i>

30
00:04:29,853 --> 00:04:31,437

<i>and leave over 11,000 dead.</i>

33
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:43,783
<i>我们所做的阻止他的一切已经失败了</i>
<i>Everything we've done to stop him has failed.</i>

34
00:04:44,701 --> 00:04:46,327
<i>但这次我很接近了</i>
<i>But I was close this time.</i>

35
00:04:47,371 --> 00:04:49,538
仅仅再试一次
Just one more try.

36
00:04:50,332 --> 00:04:51,707
<i>移植手术已经完成</i>
<i>Grafts have taken.</i>

37
00:04:52,042 --> 00:04:54,710
再造移植很稳定
The reconstructive transplant is stable.

38
00:04:55,462 --> 00:04:56,671
但是你必须明白
But you understand

39
00:04:57,130 --> 00:05:00,049
你将会看上去与你以前不一样了
you will look different to what you remember.

40
00:05:01,093 --> 00:05:02,510
眼睛将会治愈
Eyes will heal.

41
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:05,805
为了这次终极任务，你需要很好地恢复
You should recover well for this final mission.

42
00:05:06,473 --> 00:05:08,432
接着我将会退役
And then I'll be decommissioned.

43
00:05:09,393 --> 00:05:10,977
这不是仅仅身体的伤害
It's not just the physical injuries.

44
00:05:11,812 --> 00:05:13,646
你已经积累了相当多的战斗经验
You've logged more field hours

45
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:16,107
这些经验超过了我之前安排的所有特工
than any of the other agents I've been assigned to.

46
00:05:16,775 --> 00:05:18,067
这个任务是真实的
The risks are real.

47
00:05:20,404 --> 00:05:22,571
疤痕已经开始很好地复合了
The scars have begun to heal nicely.

48
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:29,245
你坏掉的声带已经恢复
Your vocal cord damage has reduced

49
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:33,124
但是也不是原来的那种声音
but will not regrow exactly the same way.

50
00:05:34,459 --> 00:05:36,544
我的歌（站）唱（斗）事（任）业（务）开始了
There goes my singing career.

51
00:05:41,883 --> 00:05:43,592
这需要一段时间适应
It will take some getting used to.

52
00:05:55,564 --> 00:05:57,148
我改变了很多
I've changed so much

53
00:05:58,817 --> 00:06:01,402
我怀疑我老妈是否都能认出我
that I doubt my own mother would recognize me.

54
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:15,041
任务指示今天将会到达
The order finally came through today.

55
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:17,168
我想
I guess

56
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:19,128
这是不可避免的了
it was inevitable.

57
00:06:20,756 --> 00:06:23,299
<i>等到你听到这个的时候，七年过去了</i>
<i>By the time you listen to this seven years will have passed.</i>

58
00:06:24,718 --> 00:06:26,093
<i>我们的第一个任务</i>
<i>Our first mission</i>

59
00:06:26,178 --> 00:06:28,679
<i>也会像我们最后一个（任务）一样重要</i>
<i>is just as important as our last.</i>

60
00:06:28,972 --> 00:06:31,974
<i>每个任务都会使得我们更加接近终极任务</i>
<i>Each one getting us closer to our final destination.</i>

61
00:06:40,275 --> 00:06:41,942
先生，请举起你的右手
Sir, please raise your right hand.

62
00:06:43,487 --> 00:06:45,696
你会庄严地的发誓去遵守
Do you solemnly swear to uphold the rules and regulations

63
00:06:45,781 --> 00:06:48,824
-代号7286以后的规则和条款么？
-是的
- set forth by T.B.R. Code 7286?
- I do.

64
00:06:48,992 --> 00:06:51,118
你会接受任何任务条款，而这些条款
Do you accept that any diversion from your mission parameters

65
00:06:51,203 --> 00:06:53,954
将会导致你立即上军事法庭，定罪
will result in immediate court martial?
And if convicted

66
00:06:54,122 --> 00:06:55,539
或判注射死刑么？
death by lethal injection.

67
00:06:55,665 --> 00:06:56,665
我接受
I do.

68
00:06:57,501 --> 00:06:58,501
谢谢，先生
Thank you, sir.

69
00:06:58,919 --> 00:06:59,919
谢谢
Thank you.

70
00:07:07,886 --> 00:07:10,012
<i>时间，赶上了我们所有的人</i>

71
00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:13,390
<i>即使那些在我们行当里的人</i>

72
00:07:16,186 --> 00:07:18,020
<i>我想你可能会说我们天赋秉异</i>
<i>I guess you could say we're gifted.</i>

73
00:07:19,606 --> 00:07:22,525
<i>上帝啊，这听起来是多么傲慢</i>
<i>God, Jesus, it sounds arrogant saying that out loud.</i>

74
00:07:23,693 --> 00:07:24,777
<i>好吧</i>

75
00:07:24,861 --> 00:07:26,195
<i>我将以一个更好的方式来说</i>

80

81
00:08:35,682 --> 00:08:36,724
我能帮你什么吗？

82
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:38,100
老恩酒

00:08:38,768 --> 00:08:40,686
老恩酒。不加冰？
Old Underwear. Straight up?

84
00:08:46,568 --> 00:08:47,568
留下这瓶
Leave the bottle.

85
00:08:49,905 --> 00:08:52,031
从你表情上，我猜你不是在庆祝
From the look of you
I'm guessing you're not celebrating.

86
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:53,532
从我的样子？
From the look of me?

87
00:08:54,117 --> 00:08:55,201
我看上去像什么？
What do I look like?

88
00:08:58,163 --> 00:09:00,289
上帝，仅仅是套话而已
Just making conversation. Jesus.

89
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:03,959
<i>他倒下了</i>

90
00:09:06,588 --> 00:09:07,588
嘿，兄弟，再来两扎（好爽啊）
Hey, bud, two more.

91
00:09:08,131 --> 00:09:09,340
巡洋舰（饮烈酒后喝的饮料），对吗？
Chaser, right?

92
00:09:16,723 --> 00:09:17,723
你是新来的
You're new.

93
00:09:18,683 --> 00:09:20,309
是的，我来这里工作才几周
Yeah, I've been working here a couple of weeks.

94
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:22,269
是吗？工作感觉如何？
Yeah? How's it working out?

95
00:09:22,896 --> 00:09:23,979
相当乏味
It's been quiet.

96
00:09:24,689 --> 00:09:25,773
人们都待在家里
People staying home.

97
00:09:26,983 --> 00:09:28,817
因为那个可恶的闪灭炸弹人吗？
Because of the big, bad Fizzle Bomber?

98
00:09:28,902 --> 00:09:29,902
是的，我想
Yeah, I guess.

99
00:09:31,029 --> 00:09:32,029
我却很喜欢
Love it.

100
00:09:32,697 --> 00:09:34,156
喜欢躲藏使得你更加安全
Like hiding makes you any safer.

101
00:09:34,866 --> 00:09:36,075
你不害怕吗？
Doesn't scare you?

102
00:09:38,078 --> 00:09:40,329
害怕地铁里面每一个怪人是无济于事的
Worrying about every freak show on the subway won't change things.

103
00:09:40,622 --> 00:09:42,915
这倒是
That is true.

104
00:09:43,792 --> 00:09:44,792
我在附近从没见过你
Haven't seen you around.

105

你经常来这？
You come here often?

106
00:09:46,294 --> 00:09:47,336
你是谁啊，是搞基的吗？
What are you, a faggot?

107
00:09:49,047 --> 00:09:50,214
你啥意思？
What's your problem?

108
00:09:50,548 --> 00:09:51,548
嘿！
Hey!

109
00:09:52,676 --> 00:09:54,009
上帝，我只是逗你玩呢
I was joking man. Jesus.

110
00:09:54,094 --> 00:09:55,302
恩~好吧，但是那一点不逗比
Yeah, well, that's not funny.

111
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:58,013
告诉我一个好的
Tell me a good one then.

112
00:09:58,390 --> 00:10:00,015
-啥，一个笑话？
-是的，来吧
- What, a joke?
- Yeah, come on.

113
00:10:00,892 --> 00:10:02,268
你懂的，免费来一撸，来吧
You know, a free shot. Come on.

114
00:10:02,352 --> 00:10:03,352
不，不，我啥也不知道
No, no, I don't know any.

115
00:10:03,728 --> 00:10:06,105
不看僧面看佛面，你在酒吧工作肯定听过笑话
You work in a bar for Chrissakes. Surely you know a joke.

116
00:10:06,189 --> 00:10:08,607
不，我不爱讲笑话，从不记这些
No, I'm terrible with jokes. Never remember them.

117
00:10:08,692 --> 00:10:09,692
来一个？
One joke?

118
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:14,321
好吧，我知道一个
All right, I know one.

119
00:10:14,406 --> 00:10:15,406
不过这个有点冷
But it's not funny.

120
00:10:15,991 --> 00:10:16,991
洗耳恭听
I'm all ears.

121
00:10:17,867 --> 00:10:20,077
好，恩~一个去酒吧的家伙，对吗？
All right, well, a guy walks into a bar, right?

122
00:10:21,705 --> 00:10:23,122
-老天，哥们
-仅仅开玩笑，不不不
- Jesus, man.
- Just kidding. No, no, no.

123
00:10:23,373 --> 00:10:24,540
我有个更给力的，给力的哦
I got a good one. I got a good one.

124
00:10:25,417 --> 00:10:27,126
是先有鸡还是先有蛋？
What comes first, the chicken or the egg?

125
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:29,420
答案是公鸡
The rooster.

126
00:10:29,713 --> 00:10:31,839
晕~我擦~看见了吧？我太挫了
Oh, shit, see? I'm terrible.

127
00:10:32,882 --> 00:10:34,049
这就是你最好的？
That's the best you got?

128
00:10:34,301 --> 00:10:35,301
-是的，好吧...
-这个笑话有点冷
- Yeah, well...
- That's not funny.

129
00:10:35,385 --> 00:10:36,510
我告你不冷
I told you it wasn't.

130
00:10:41,141 --> 00:10:42,308
你一直都在想那个？
You ever think about that, though?

131
00:10:42,809 --> 00:10:43,809
关于什么的？
About what?

132
00:10:43,977 --> 00:10:45,519
你懂的，关于哪个先有的问题
You know, about what comes first.

133
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:48,188
我需要在乎什么吗？
What do I care?

134
00:10:48,273 --> 00:10:49,732
-我杞人忧天了
-好吧
- I got more important shit to worry about.
- All right.

135
00:10:49,816 --> 00:10:51,275
好吧，你真是碉堡了，你知道的
Well, you're a big deal, you know.

136
00:10:51,401 --> 00:10:52,943
你有很重要的事情做，对吗？
You got important things to do, right?

137
00:10:53,403 --> 00:10:54,403
你是做什么的？
What do you do?

138
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:56,113
我做我需要做的
Whatever I have to.

139
00:10:56,573 --> 00:10:58,741
好吧，说实话，现如今混口饭吃不容易
Yeah, well it's tough making a living, that's for sure.

140
00:10:59,451 --> 00:11:00,868
你有什么困难？
What do you know about tough?

141
00:11:03,705 --> 00:11:05,247
和旁边那哥们一样困难，我想
As much as the next guy, I guess.

142
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:08,876
像一个未婚老妈一样困难？
How about as much as an unmarried mother?

143
00:11:11,379 --> 00:11:12,421
几个意思？
What does that mean?

144
00:11:15,133 --> 00:11:17,760
我写忏悔书的，四美分一个单词
Four cents a word, I write confession stories.

145
00:11:18,887 --> 00:11:20,888
“未婚老妈”是我笔名
"The Unmarried Mother" is my pen name.

146
00:11:22,307 --> 00:11:23,307
你没耍我？
Are you serious?

147
00:11:24,184 --> 00:11:25,184
是啊
Yeah.

148
00:11:25,352 --> 00:11:26,769
额~好吧
Right. Right!

149
00:11:27,187 --> 00:11:28,270
那你生意如何？
How's business?

150
00:11:28,772 --> 00:11:30,814
生意还凑合，我有一个周刊专栏
Business is okay. I have a weekly column.

151
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:32,649
我写，他们打印，我靠这个吃饭
I write them, they print them, I eat.

152
00:11:34,569 --> 00:11:35,569
是吗？
Right?

153
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:38,947
-啥？你读过我的文章？
-是的
- What, you read my work?
- Yeah, yeah.

154
00:11:39,115 --> 00:11:40,199
把你吓着了？
Does that surprise you?

155
00:11:40,784 --> 00:11:42,242
-是的，一点点吧
-为什么
- Yeah, a little.
- Why?

156
00:11:42,452 --> 00:11:43,786
你不符合样本
You don't fit the demo.

157
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,120
样本？
The demo?

158
00:11:45,455 --> 00:11:48,040
-人口统计学样本
-是的，是的
- The demographic.
- Right. Right.

159
00:11:48,124 --> 00:11:49,958
你知道，那些想感觉好受一些的离婚女
You know, broken women who want to feel better

160
00:11:50,043 --> 00:11:51,752
通过读一些纸上写着的
about their pitiful lives by reading

161
00:11:52,045 --> 00:11:54,421
悲惨故事或者背叛的经历
hard luck stories of heartbreak and betrayal

162
00:11:54,506 --> 00:11:55,964
来慰藉心灵，这些光滑的书页
spewed across the glossy pages

163
00:11:56,049 --> 00:11:57,758
只是25美分的纸浆烂泥
of 25 cent pulp sludge.

164
00:11:59,302 --> 00:12:00,260
是的，没错！
Yeah, exactly.

165
00:12:00,345 --> 00:12:02,596
好吧，额~你不觉得你现在生活有点苦逼？
Yeah, well you're being a little hard on yourself, don't you think?

166
00:12:03,014 --> 00:12:04,014
真是一团糟
It's garbage.

167
00:12:04,974 --> 00:12:07,393
我想我有些讲故事的天赋，但是我和谁开玩笑呢？
I thought I had some talent telling stories but who am I kidding?

168
00:12:07,936 --> 00:12:09,269
我意思是，你告诉我，你已经读过他们了
I mean, you tell me. You've read them.

169
00:12:10,313 --> 00:12:12,022
我得承认我只读过一点点
I have to admit I've had a few

170
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:15,067
黑夜里，当我以一点点女性的视角
dark nights when I've looked to you for a little

171
00:12:15,235 --> 00:12:16,985
来看你
insight into the feminine mind.

172
00:12:17,195 --> 00:12:19,863
你知道，对我而言你就像女性视角的一个热门产品
You know, it seems to me you've got a real hit on the woman's angle.

173
00:12:20,365 --> 00:12:21,990
-女人的角度？
-是的
- Woman's angle?
- Yeah.

174
00:12:23,201 --> 00:12:24,827
是的，我知道女性视角
Yeah, I know the woman's angle.

175
00:12:25,745 --> 00:12:26,745
我应该是的。
I should.

176
00:12:27,247 --> 00:12:29,873
为什么？你结婚了？你有妹妹么？
Why, you married? You got sisters?

177
00:12:29,958 --> 00:12:31,458
如果我告诉你，你不会相信的。
You wouldn't believe me if I told you.

178
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:34,461
这个工作告诉我一件事
The one thing that this job has taught me

179
00:12:34,546 --> 00:12:36,547
就是真相比虚构要奇怪得多
is that truth is stranger than fiction.

180
00:12:36,798 --> 00:12:38,549
我听过一些难以置信的玩意
I have heard some incredible shit.

181
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,259
没有什么能让我大吃一惊的
Nothing astonishes me anymore.

182
00:12:40,385 --> 00:12:41,802
你不知道难以置信意味着什么
You don't know what incredible means.

183
00:12:41,886 --> 00:12:43,178
是吗？好，来，试试看？
Yeah? Well, try me.

184
00:12:47,934 --> 00:12:49,059
就是这样，我明白了
Here you go. I got that.

185
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:58,527
忘了它吧，哥们。我不会告诉你的
Forget it, man. I'm not telling you.

186
00:12:58,945 --> 00:13:01,029
你害怕它不够好
You're scared it's not good enough.

187
00:13:01,114 --> 00:13:02,406
-你觉得这个管用吗？
-是的
- You think that'll work?
- Yeah.

188
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:03,490
我们是什么？12岁小孩吗？
What are we, 12?

189
00:13:04,701 --> 00:13:05,701
来吧
Come on.

190
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:11,540
我赌你那瓶剩下的酒，我这有你从未听过的最劲爆的故事
Bet you the rest of that bottle I got the best story you ever heard.

191

赌一整瓶
Bet you a full bottle.

192
00:13:23,845 --> 00:13:24,845
你说什么？
What do you say?

193
00:13:28,516 --> 00:13:29,516
如果我输了呢？
If I lose?

194
00:13:29,934 --> 00:13:31,268
仅仅给20美分的小费
Just add a 20 to the tip.

195
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:34,980
为什么不呢？
Why not?

196
00:13:37,317 --> 00:13:38,317
嘿，伙计
Hey, man.

197

-两扎
-好

198
00:13:41,321 --> 00:13:43,030
<i>Mayor Davidson,你怎样回应事实？</i>
<i>Mayor Davidson, how do you respond to the fact</i>

199
00:13:43,114 --> 00:13:44,990
<i>许多纽约人离开了这个城市</i>

200
00:13:45,074 --> 00:13:47,784
<i>出于害怕闪灭炸弹人</i>
<i>in fear of a fifth attack by the Fizzle Bomber?</i>

201
00:13:47,869 --> 00:13:49,411
<i>我们有额外的警队巡逻</i>

<i>and the FBI in order to track down the suspect.</i>

205

多么小白的名字
What a stupid name.

206
00:14:01,049 --> 00:14:02,049
“闪灭炸弹人”
"Fizzle Bomber."

207
00:14:02,425 --> 00:14:04,760
这家伙做了压缩三次甲基三硝基胺混合爆炸物
The guy makes compressed RDX-based explosive compounds.

208
00:14:05,053 --> 00:14:06,053
这可不简单
That's not easy.

209
00:14:06,221 --> 00:14:08,013
“闪灭炸弹人”很容易记住
"Fizzle Bomber" is easier to remember.

210
00:14:08,348 --> 00:14:09,348
我增恨那个名字
I hate that name.

211
00:14:09,891 --> 00:14:11,391
就像他的炸弹在嘶嘶作响
Makes it sound like his bombs just fizzle.

212
00:14:11,476 --> 00:14:12,643
就像他们没有做任何破坏
Like they don't do any real damage.

213
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:14,645
我不认为任何人都在怀疑
I don't think anybody's doubting

214
00:14:15,104 --> 00:14:16,897
这哥们的危险性
how dangerous this asshole is.

215
00:14:17,106 --> 00:14:19,942
好吧，有很多傲慢自大的傻X需要教训教训
Well, there's a lot of selfish assholes out there needing a good shake up.

216
00:14:20,985 --> 00:14:22,194
他们应该感到害怕

阻止这个家伙

是的
Yeah.

221
00:14:33,623 --> 00:14:35,290
也许他在帮这个城市一个忙
Maybe he's doing the city a favor.

222
00:14:39,921 --> 00:14:41,588
你说这话当心被别人听见
Better be careful who hears you say that.

223
00:14:42,048 --> 00:14:43,131
什么，你认为我说错了？
What, you think I'm wrong?

224
00:14:43,466 --> 00:14:45,634
我仅仅说刚才那种谈话会让你惹麻烦
I'm just saying that kind of talk can get you in trouble.

225
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:48,804
没有比我之前的遭遇更惨的了
No worse than I've already been through.

226
00:14:49,389 --> 00:14:52,057
听着，你一直向我保证这是我一生最好的故事
Now listen, you keep promising the best story of my life.

227
00:14:52,976 --> 00:14:54,268
但是我没听到任何实质内容
But I'm not hearing anything.

228
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:03,360
好好
All right.

我想我将开始说了

不，我仅仅是，我想...

嗯~这小孩没有任何外部创伤痕迹
Well, there's no signs of trauma or exposure.

248

孩子显得恨健康

如果她表现出任何感染或者过量的咳嗽

现在应该就叫她Jane吧。
Jane will have to do for now.

从引诱中逃离

因此我集中注意力关注那些更加重要的事情

谁会在乎酒吧老板长相？

有点思维混乱

359
00:23:13,392 --> 00:23:16,102
或许那是因为对于她们而言是一个陌生的领域
Perhaps that's because to them a thought is unfamiliar territory.

360
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:19,314

Nothing's too good for our boys, right?

For people with exceptional abilities.

534
00:33:50,278 --> 00:33:51,821
像你这样的人
People like yourself.

535
00:33:51,947 --> 00:33:53,364
却没有家庭
People without families.

536
00:33:53,448 --> 00:33:55,533
没有相公、娘子和孩儿
Without husbands and wives and children.

537
00:33:55,867 --> 00:33:56,951
没有过去
No past.

538
00:33:57,244 --> 00:33:58,786
没有同未来的联系
No ties to the future.

539
00:33:59,955 --> 00:34:02,164
如你所见，我们的工作也已完成
You see, the work we do is complicated

540
00:34:02,749 --> 00:34:05,126
需要雇员具有
and it requires employees with

541
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:07,920
高级机动的技术，出色的记忆
advanced motor skills, remarkable memories.

542
00:34:08,255 --> 00:34:10,589
这是一个为了最好最牛比的人的工作
It's a job for the best and the brightest.

543
00:34:11,258 --> 00:34:12,299
为了精英
For the elite.

544
00:34:14,344 --> 00:34:15,344
精英？
The elite?

545
00:34:16,930 --> 00:34:17,972
我无法相信
I couldn't believe it.

546
00:34:18,140 --> 00:34:20,057
貌似我有个大好前程似的
Seemed like I had a bright future ahead of me.

547
00:34:20,934 --> 00:34:22,560
我却不明白这份工作意味着什么
I didn't really understand what the job meant.

548
00:34:22,644 --> 00:34:24,979
他们非常隐蔽和秘密，但
They were very covert and secretive but

549
00:34:26,022 --> 00:34:27,773
我知道它将给我更好的生活
I knew it would change my life for the better.

550
00:34:29,109 --> 00:34:30,735
并且他们不再有处女情结
And they didn't insist on virgins.

551
00:34:31,528 --> 00:34:32,903
他们与太空集团不同
They were different to Space Corp.

552
00:34:34,614 --> 00:34:37,825
直到我裙子变紧我才意识到我的未来完蛋了
It wasn't until my skirts got tight that I realized my future was over.

553
00:34:40,203 --> 00:34:41,203
你怀孕了？
You were pregnant?

554
00:34:41,913 --> 00:34:43,706
是的，你不知道？
Yeah, wouldn't you know it?

555
00:34:44,583 --> 00:34:47,168
高富帅离我而去，丢我一人在这吹冷空气
My mystery man had left me with more than just a broken heart.

556
00:34:48,962 --> 00:34:51,422
说好的明亮未来呢？精英女孩呢？
So that bright future, that girl who was elite?

557
00:34:51,506 --> 00:34:52,506
她走了~
She was gone.

558
00:34:53,049 --> 00:34:54,884
我再也没见过Robertson先生。
And I never saw Mr. Robertson again.

559
00:34:57,512 --> 00:34:59,764
<i>无路可退时，我到了一家慈善病房</i>
<i>With nowhere to go I landed in a charity ward</i>

560
00:34:59,848 --> 00:35:02,683
<i>被其他各种大肚婆和小跑夜壶环绕</i>
<i>surrounded by other big bellies and trotted bedpans</i>

561
00:35:02,768 --> 00:35:04,018
<i>终于轮到我了</i>
<i>until my time came.</i>

562
00:35:05,604 --> 00:35:07,021
<i>我从未如此孤独</i>
<i>I never felt so alone.</i>

563
00:35:13,445 --> 00:35:16,489
<i>一天夜里我发现我在手术台上，而一个护士对我说...</i>
<i>One night I found myself on an operating table with a nurse saying...</i>

564
00:35:16,698 --> 00:35:17,865
放松，Jane，放松
Relax, Jane. Relax.

565
00:35:17,949 --> 00:35:19,074
现在请深呼吸
Now breathe deeply.

566
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:35,800
你赶脚如何？
How do you feel?

567
00:35:36,343 --> 00:35:37,968
忒累了
Tired.

568
00:35:39,054 --> 00:35:40,221
这很正常
That's natural.

569
00:35:42,599 --> 00:35:44,099
破腹产很困难
A cesarean can be difficult.

570
00:35:44,559 --> 00:35:45,893
你度过了危机
You pulled through fine.

571
00:35:46,102 --> 00:35:48,604
破腹产？医生，我的小苹果还好吗？
A cesarean? Doctor, is my baby okay?

572
00:35:48,772 --> 00:35:49,939
你的宝贝很好！
Your baby's fine.

573
00:35:50,982 --> 00:35:52,233
男的女的？
Is it a boy or a girl?

574
00:35:52,734 --> 00:35:54,026
是个健康的小女孩
It's a healthy little girl.

575
00:35:54,277 --> 00:35:55,861
7磅3盎司
Seven pounds three ounces.

576
00:35:57,823 --> 00:35:58,906
<i>你知道这样...</i>
<i>You know it's something...</i>

577
00:35:59,074 --> 00:36:00,282
...生小孩
...to have made a baby.

578
00:36:01,034 --> 00:36:03,452
我记得我得加个允许“女士”条例
I remember thinking I would tack on the admission form "Mrs."

579
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:05,788
告诉他他爹挂了
Let her think her papa was dead.

580
00:36:06,915 --> 00:36:08,249
没有孤儿院接收我小孩
No orphanage for my kid.

581
00:36:09,876 --> 00:36:11,168
<i>但是外科医生仍在聊天</i>
<i>But then the surgeon kept talking.</i>

582
00:36:13,547 --> 00:36:14,755
这是嘛玩意，医生？
What is it, Doctor?

583
00:36:16,007 --> 00:36:18,175
你丫之前有没有彻底检查过？
Have you ever had a thorough examination before?

584
00:36:20,011 --> 00:36:21,011
是的
Yes.

585
00:36:21,346 --> 00:36:22,763
医生告诉你什么？
What'd the doctors tell you?

586
00:36:24,349 --> 00:36:25,432
啥也没有
Nothing.

587
00:36:25,517 --> 00:36:26,684
我认为一切都很好
I thought everything was fine.

588
00:36:27,269 --> 00:36:29,728
所以没有医生告诉过你
So no doctor's ever told you that

589
00:36:30,856 --> 00:36:32,106
你身体内部构造
your internal set up

590
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:34,316
与大多数人不同？
was different than most?

591
00:36:35,861 --> 00:36:36,861
没有
No.

592
00:36:36,945 --> 00:36:38,070
你们在说啥？
What are you talking about?

593
00:36:41,783 --> 00:36:42,783
为什么？
Why?

594
00:36:45,871 --> 00:36:48,372
你没听那个苏格兰医师说吗？
Did you ever hear about that Scottish physician?

595
00:36:48,498 --> 00:36:50,666
她35岁前是个女的
She lived as a female till she was 35,

596
00:36:50,876 --> 00:36:54,336
然后她接受手术变成法律和医学上的男人了？
and then she had surgery and became legally and medically a man?

597
00:36:56,006 --> 00:36:57,631
她结婚了，一切都很好。
She got married. Everything was okay.

598
00:37:01,219 --> 00:37:02,887
打算对我怎么做？
What's that got to do with me?

599
00:37:07,851 --> 00:37:11,270
当我们在实施手术时，我们发现一些非常独特的地方
When we performed your operation we found something very unique.

600
00:37:11,646 --> 00:37:12,813
实际是一种
One of a kind, actually.

601
00:37:13,273 --> 00:37:16,650
在我成功取出你小孩后，也即主要外科手术
After I successfully removed your baby I called for the Chief of Surgery.

602
00:37:16,776 --> 00:37:20,154
我们磋商和工作了数小时
We held consultation and we worked for hours

603
00:37:20,697 --> 00:37:22,489
力所能及把你重构
to reconstruct you the best we could.

604
00:37:24,034 --> 00:37:25,034
重构？
Reconstruct?

605
00:37:25,368 --> 00:37:28,412
你有两种器官，Jane
You had two full sets of organs, Jane.

606
00:37:29,414 --> 00:37:31,165
女人和男人的
Female and male.

607
00:37:32,208 --> 00:37:33,375
两者都不成熟
Both immature

608
00:37:33,877 --> 00:37:35,127
但是女性器官
but the female set

609
00:37:35,211 --> 00:37:37,755
很好地成长，使你可以有小孩
well enough developed for you to have a baby.

610
00:37:39,424 --> 00:37:41,008
但是恐怕，亲，
But I'm afraid, my dear,

611
00:37:42,010 --> 00:37:45,012
过量的生育出血
the excessive bleeding from the birth

612
00:37:45,180 --> 00:37:47,765
逼着我们进行了子宫切除
forced us to perform a hysterectomy.

613
00:37:48,058 --> 00:37:50,392
我们不得不阉了你的女性卵巢和子宫
We had to remove your ovaries and uterus.

614
00:37:54,773 --> 00:37:55,856
你在说什么？
What are you saying?

615
00:37:56,983 --> 00:37:58,859
但是至于重构
But the reconstruction

616
00:37:59,194 --> 00:38:02,571
允许我们创建一个男性泌尿系统
allowed us to create a male urinary tract.

617
00:38:03,114 --> 00:38:05,074
进一步外科手术还会继续
Further surgeries will be required.

618
00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:09,453
变成男的？
To become a man?

619
00:38:12,958 --> 00:38:14,375
你坑爹啊？
Is this some kind of joke?

620
00:38:15,502 --> 00:38:16,877
我想我没坑爹
I'm afraid it's not.

621
00:38:18,213 --> 00:38:19,213
你还年轻
You're young.

622
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:21,799
你的骨骼将会重新适应
Your bones will readjust.

623
00:38:21,883 --> 00:38:23,884
我们将监控你的荷尔蒙平衡
We'll watch your hormonal balance.

624
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:25,594
这不是宣告死亡
It's not a death sentence.

625
00:38:26,137 --> 00:38:27,388
你的生活可以继续
Your life can continue.

626
00:38:36,439 --> 00:38:39,024
你是俺这辈子见过的最吊炸天的事情
You're the best thing that's ever happened to me.

627
00:38:41,361 --> 00:38:42,945
你想过名字吗？
Have you thought of a name yet?

628
00:38:44,990 --> 00:38:46,240
额~我正在想Jane，
Well, I was thinking of Jane,

629
00:38:47,242 --> 00:38:48,534
在她母亲以后
after her mother.

630
00:38:49,536 --> 00:38:52,079
<i>我想这是为了在家里留存英名的一种方式</i>
<i>I guess it was a way of keeping the name in the family.</i>

631
00:38:52,831 --> 00:38:55,416
<i>毕竟，我知道最终我将改变我自己的（名字）</i>
<i>After all, I knew eventually I would have to change mine.</i>

632
00:38:55,959 --> 00:38:57,376
这是个好名字
That's a good name.

633
00:38:58,420 --> 00:39:00,421
<i>我的感受变成了冷酷的决心</i>
<i>My feelings changed to cold determination.</i>

634
00:39:01,256 --> 00:39:03,257
<i>我得做些对我的宝贝Jane一些的好事</i>
<i>I had to do right by my baby Jane.</i>

635
00:39:04,342 --> 00:39:06,385
但是两周后，什么也不是了
But two weeks later that didn't mean anything.

636
00:39:07,512 --> 00:39:08,512
为啥？
Why?

637
00:39:10,098 --> 00:39:11,223
他被夺走了
She was snatched.

638
00:39:11,474 --> 00:39:13,267
-夺走了？
-是的
- Snatched?
- Yeah.

639
00:39:13,476 --> 00:39:14,560
“夺走了”？你啥意思啊？
What do you mean "snatched"?

640
00:39:14,978 --> 00:39:16,020
就是拐走了
Kidnapped.

641
00:39:16,104 --> 00:39:17,938
从该死的医院护士病房被偷走了
Stolen from the goddamn hospital nursery.

642
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:21,442
我意思是那个男人是怎么来把弄走的？
I mean how's that for taking the last a man's got to live for?

643
00:39:24,487 --> 00:39:26,613
<i>当护士背过身，有个人走进来</i>
<i>When the nurse had her back turned, someone walked in</i>

644
00:39:26,698 --> 00:39:28,073
<i>并且带着她走出去</i>
<i>and walked out with her.</i>

645
00:39:29,451 --> 00:39:30,492
<i>没有任何线索？</i>
<i>Were there any clues?</i>

646
00:39:30,994 --> 00:39:32,578
<i>抑或是任何描述？</i>
<i>Any description?</i>

647
00:39:33,163 --> 00:39:34,288
就一男的
Just a man.

648
00:39:35,081 --> 00:39:36,540
<i>脸型嘛，</i>
<i>With a face-shaped face.</i>

649
00:39:37,459 --> 00:39:38,751
<i>像你或者像我这种</i>
<i>Like yours or mine.</i>

650
00:39:44,257 --> 00:39:46,133
不！不！
No! No!

651
00:39:48,470 --> 00:39:49,678
有可能是孩子他爹
Could have been the baby's father.

652
00:39:50,138 --> 00:39:53,182
护士发誓，说是个老头但是谁又会偷我的小孩？
The nurse swore it was an older man but who else would swipe my baby?

653
00:39:53,892 --> 00:39:55,017
你做了神马？
What'd you do?

654
00:39:55,727 --> 00:39:57,311
填了一个人口失踪单子
Filed a missing person's report.

655
00:39:58,063 --> 00:40:01,148
检查收容机构，孤儿院。凡是你能说出来的，我都找了
Checked adoption agencies, orphanages. You name it, I did it.

656
00:40:02,192 --> 00:40:03,192
但毫无结果
But nothing.

657
00:40:03,526 --> 00:40:04,985
就像她消声觅迹了一般
It's like she vanished.

658
00:40:05,653 --> 00:40:07,154
他们没找到那家伙？
And they never found the guy?

659
00:40:10,033 --> 00:40:11,158
从来没有
Never.

660
00:40:12,786 --> 00:40:16,163
但随后我的其他小问题却找上门来了
But then my other little problem began to take center stage.

661
00:40:19,584 --> 00:40:22,252
Jane，我想从我这里倒数10下
Jane, I want you to count backwards from 10 for me.

662
00:40:24,172 --> 00:40:26,799
10,9，8，
Ten, nine, eight,

663
00:40:27,050 --> 00:40:30,803
7，6，5，4，...
seven, six, five, four...

664
00:40:34,182 --> 00:40:36,058
<i>我花了11个月在那个该死的地方</i>
<i>I spent 11 months in that fucked-up place</i>

665
00:40:36,518 --> 00:40:39,186
<i>接受了三次大手术</i>
<i>and had three major operations.</i>

666
00:40:41,231 --> 00:40:43,190
我开始吃睾丸激素
I started taking testosterone,

667
00:40:43,942 --> 00:40:46,026
使得我的声音深沉一点
which deepened my voice a little bit

668
00:40:46,111 --> 00:40:48,153
<i>但是也不够那么深沉</i>
<i>but not enough.</i>

669
00:40:48,488 --> 00:40:51,573
<i>因此我开始练习像男人那样说话</i>

678
00:41:05,547 --> 00:41:06,755
天气真好
It's a lovely day.

679
00:41:09,175 --> 00:41:10,884
虽然我从没做的到位
I never could get it right, though.

680
00:41:13,596 --> 00:41:14,596
<i>你好</i>

681

我叫Jane

我叫Jane
My name is Jane.

685
00:41:33,324 --> 00:41:34,741
我叫...
My name is...

686
00:41:53,469 --> 00:41:56,889
<i>我总是很害怕照镜子，看见镜中的我看着自己</i>
<i>I was always afraid to look in the mirror and see the person looking back at me.</i>

687
00:41:57,557 --> 00:41:59,433
<i>我尽力规避</i>
<i>I held off as long as I could.</i>

688
00:42:04,147 --> 00:42:06,398
<i>现在，却再也没事了</i>
<i>Now, it didn't matter anymore.</i>

689
00:42:11,404 --> 00:42:13,614
<i>我认识的那个人已经走了</i>
<i>The person I knew was truly gone.</i>

690
00:42:44,938 --> 00:42:45,938
<i>陌生了</i>
<i>Strange.</i>

691
00:42:47,815 --> 00:42:49,691
每次我看见自己的新面容
Every time I looked at my new appearance

692
00:42:49,776 --> 00:42:52,152
我提醒自己那些毁掉我人生的王八蛋
I was reminded of that bastard that ruined my life.

693
00:42:55,323 --> 00:42:57,241
我想这是某种混乱的讽刺
That's some messed up irony I guess.

694
00:43:00,578 --> 00:43:01,578
有趣的是
The funny thing was

695
00:43:02,497 --> 00:43:03,705
那些护士
the nurses,

696
00:43:05,333 --> 00:43:06,833
她们认为我玉树凌风，潇洒迷人
they thought I was quite handsome.

697
00:43:07,752 --> 00:43:08,752
是的
Yeah,

698
00:43:08,962 --> 00:43:10,337
一个该死的讽刺
a fucking catch.

699
00:43:11,256 --> 00:43:12,381
好，好，好
Right, right, right.

700
00:43:14,259 --> 00:43:16,343
我想我也知道女人们想听到的
I guess I also knew what women wanted to hear.

701
00:43:16,469 --> 00:43:17,844
祝贺，对吗？
Compliments, right?

702
00:43:19,430 --> 00:43:20,430
是的
Right.

703
00:43:22,433 --> 00:43:23,433
好吧，
Well,

704
00:43:24,686 --> 00:43:26,687
貌似你长出来很完美
it seems to me you came out okay.

705
00:43:30,191 --> 00:43:31,358
长出来很好？
Came out okay?

706
00:43:31,442 --> 00:43:32,859
额~你知道，我想说
Well, you know, I just mean

707
00:43:33,486 --> 00:43:35,237
你似乎像一个
you just seem like a,

708
00:43:35,613 --> 00:43:37,572
你懂的，一个正常男人
you know, a normal man.

709
00:43:39,325 --> 00:43:40,325
是的
Yeah.

710
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:43,161
再正常不过了
More normal than ever now.

711
00:43:43,705 --> 00:43:45,580
什么个程度呢？意味着什么？
How so? What's that mean?

712
00:43:46,082 --> 00:43:48,375
好吧，我刚发现今早
Well, I just found out this morning that

713
00:43:48,459 --> 00:43:50,377
我不在打发空闲时间了
I'm not shooting blanks anymore.

714
00:43:51,713 --> 00:43:53,547
额，好吧
Well, all right.

715
00:43:53,881 --> 00:43:57,884
医生预言，我完全能够生育
Doctor's prognosis,
I'm a fully fertile male specimen.

716
00:43:58,052 --> 00:44:00,512
好吧，让我第一个祝贺你
Well, let me be the first to congratulate you.

717
00:44:01,431 --> 00:44:02,556
欢迎来到男人阵营
Welcome to the tribe.

718
00:44:09,897 --> 00:44:11,565
你知道，有时候
You know, sometimes

719
00:44:13,359 --> 00:44:16,778
我想这个世界受到狗屎风暴是罪有应得
I think this world deserves the shit storm that it gets.

720
00:44:18,406 --> 00:44:19,406
我知道
I know.

721
00:44:20,325 --> 00:44:22,367
我意思是，让我们面对他，没有人是无辜的
I mean, let's face it. Nobody's innocent.

722
00:44:23,870 --> 00:44:27,331
每个人利用其它人去得到他想要的东西
Everybody just uses everybody else
to get what they want.

723
00:44:28,750 --> 00:44:29,916
也许是
Maybe.

724
00:44:30,752 --> 00:44:31,793
但也许又不是
Maybe not.

725
00:44:37,925 --> 00:44:40,302
你听过“毁灭的女人”吗？
You ever hear the expression "a ruined woman"?

726
00:44:40,428 --> 00:44:41,470
当然
Of course.

727
00:44:42,263 --> 00:44:45,432
是的，我就是毁灭的女人
Well, I was as ruined as a woman could be.

728
00:44:47,268 --> 00:44:48,810
我不在是女人了
I was no longer a woman

729
00:44:48,936 --> 00:44:51,605
并且我不知道如何成为一个男人
and I did not know how to be a man.

730
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:54,274
好吧，这确实需要花时间适应
Well, it does take some getting used to.

731
00:44:55,401 --> 00:44:56,610
你不明白
You have no idea.

732
00:44:57,445 --> 00:45:00,655
我并非说学会穿衣或者如何说话
I don't mean learning how to dress or talk.

733
00:45:01,032 --> 00:45:04,576
或者不走错洗澡间
Or not walking into the wrong bathroom.

734
00:45:07,622 --> 00:45:08,914
你知道的，我该怎么活？
You know, how could I live?

735
00:45:09,791 --> 00:45:11,333
我应从事什么职业？
What job could I get?

736
00:45:12,085 --> 00:45:13,335
我不懂贸易
I didn't know a trade.

737
00:45:13,753 --> 00:45:15,128
不会开车
Couldn't drive a car.

738
00:45:16,798 --> 00:45:19,841
我憎恨离我而去的王八蛋
I hate that bastard for ripping out my heart

739
00:45:19,926 --> 00:45:21,468
他毁了我的生活
and ruining my life.

740
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:24,096
他该死
He deserves to die.

741
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:29,684
<i>所以我想过再去太空集团的应征</i>
<i>So I thought I'd reenlist in Space Corp.</i>

742
00:45:30,728 --> 00:45:32,646
<i>这次去变成一个宇航员</i>
<i>This time to become an astronaut.</i>

743
00:45:34,982 --> 00:45:36,650
<i>这很讽刺，我知道</i>
<i>It was ridiculous, I know.</i>

744
00:45:37,026 --> 00:45:38,860
<i>他们有我的记录，我不能撒谎</i>
<i>They had my records. I couldn't lie.</i>

745
00:45:41,989 --> 00:45:44,908
<i>一个人看着我，而我被标上了不适合基本训练的标签</i>
<i>One look at me and I was marked unfit for basic training.</i>

746
00:45:46,119 --> 00:45:48,745
<i>我认为医生只是对我好奇而已</i>
<i>I think the doctor spent time on me just from curiosity.</i>

747
00:45:50,498 --> 00:45:51,873
<i>他读了关于我的情况</i>
<i>He'd read about my case.</i>

748
00:45:53,751 --> 00:45:55,335
我绝望了
I was desperate.

749
00:45:55,753 --> 00:45:57,003
我在寻找一个回去的路
I was looking for a way back in.

750
00:45:58,923 --> 00:46:01,341
你知道，我终身被人叫做怪物
You know, I've been called a freak my whole life.

751
00:46:02,176 --> 00:46:03,802
而我真的就是
Now I really was.

752
00:46:05,930 --> 00:46:07,597
就像一个实验的小白鼠
Just a lab rat to be experimented on.

753
00:46:07,682 --> 00:46:08,682
我很抱歉
I'm so sorry.

754
00:46:08,766 --> 00:46:10,809
-没事
-我就这样
- Yeah, right.
- I am.

755
00:46:13,980 --> 00:46:17,524
我遇到很多人对我的遭遇表示遗憾
I've had a lot of people tell me how sorry they are for what happened to me.

756
00:46:19,235 --> 00:46:20,610
我不想在听到这些了
I don't want to hear it anymore.

757
00:46:20,695 --> 00:46:21,736
那你接下来想要啥？
Then what do you want?

758
00:46:24,574 --> 00:46:25,782
每个人想要什么？

爱情
Love.

760
00:46:28,244 --> 00:46:29,870
去他的爱情
Fuck love.

761
00:46:31,122 --> 00:46:32,330
一个目的
A purpose.

762
00:46:32,707 --> 00:46:33,874
目的？
A purpose?

763
00:46:34,876 --> 00:46:36,376
你没有吗？
You don't have that?

764
00:46:37,086 --> 00:46:38,587
我正为此而努力
I'm working on it.

765
00:46:39,547 --> 00:46:40,839
那为何爱情不能成为一个目的？
Why can't love be a purpose?

766
00:46:41,841 --> 00:46:42,883
那完全是扯蛋
Hippy bullshit.

767
00:46:43,426 --> 00:46:45,177
恨比爱容易，对吗？
It's easier to hate than to love, right?

768
00:46:47,221 --> 00:46:48,221
是的
Yeah.

769
00:46:48,389 --> 00:46:49,931
很容易毁了某件事
It's easier to destroy something.

770
00:46:50,016 --> 00:46:51,099
杀了某个人
Kill somebody.

771
00:46:51,476 --> 00:46:52,726
你认为你能够做那些？
You think you could do that?

772
00:46:54,270 --> 00:46:55,312
或许吧
Maybe.

773
00:46:59,484 --> 00:47:01,067
我从你眼神中也看出来了
I see it in your eyes, too.

774
00:47:02,403 --> 00:47:03,403
充满怨恨
That bitterness.

775
00:47:04,739 --> 00:47:05,864

能够
It can.

777
00:47:13,164 --> 00:47:14,998
好吧，你知道，逆水行舟
Well, you know if you don't move forward

778
00:47:15,082 --> 00:47:17,626
不进则退
you fall backwards into a river of shit.

779
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:21,880
因此
So

780
00:47:23,591 --> 00:47:27,469
不管如何，与其抑郁抱怨，担心未来
anyway, rather than getting angry and pissing away my entire future

781
00:47:29,055 --> 00:47:31,097
不如坚持我的人生向前进
I knew I just had to get on with my life.

782
00:47:39,357 --> 00:47:40,357
<i>So</i>
<i>因此</i>

783
00:47:41,484 --> 00:47:42,776
<i>我改了名字</i>
<i>I changed my name</i>

784

<i>but the hours were long and the money was horseshit.</i>

787
00:48:01,045 --> 00:48:04,839
<i>因此我买了个打字机，让我自己成为一个公共速记员</i>
<i>So I bought a typewriter and set myself up as a public stenographer.</i>

788
00:48:06,884 --> 00:48:07,884
<i>多么可笑啊</i>
<i>What a laugh.</i>

789

<i>四个月间，我打了六封信，和一个手稿</i>
<i>In four months I typed six letters and one manuscript.</i>

790
00:48:13,558 --> 00:48:17,060
<i>手稿是给</i> 真实生活故事 <i>而且纯粹浪费纸张</i>
<i>The manuscript was for</i> Real Life Tales <i>and a total waste of paper.</i>

791
00:48:17,144 --> 00:48:18,895
<i>但是那个王八蛋写了卖了</i>
<i>But the jerk who wrote it, sold it.</i>

792
00:48:19,063 --> 00:48:20,188
<i>使我萌生了一个想法</i>
<i>Which gave me an idea.</i>

793
00:48:23,943 --> 00:48:26,945
<i>我买了一叠忏悔杂志，并且学习它们</i>
<i>I bought a stack of confession magazines and studied them.</i>

794
00:48:35,830 --> 00:48:37,080
<i>文思泉涌</i>
<i>The words came easy.</i>

795
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,167
<i>“未婚的母亲”横空出世</i>
<i>The Unmarried Mother was born.</i>

796
00:48:43,879 --> 00:48:46,256
<i>因此，现在你明白我是怎么以专业女性角度看待</i>
<i>So, now you know how I get the authentic woman's angle</i>

797
00:48:46,841 --> 00:48:48,633
一个未婚母亲的故事。
on an Unmarried Mother story.

798
00:48:49,176 --> 00:48:51,344
虽然最终版本我还没有卖
Through the only version I haven't sold.

799
00:48:52,054 --> 00:48:53,054
而真实是
The true one.

800
00:48:54,807 --> 00:48:57,183
那么，我怎样赢得那瓶酒？
So, do I win the bottle?

801
00:49:00,229 --> 00:49:01,229
不错
Not bad.

802
00:49:03,107 --> 00:49:04,190
不错
Not bad.

803
00:49:07,028 --> 00:49:08,945
那么，就结了？故事结束了？
So, is that it? Story's over?

804
00:49:09,322 --> 00:49:11,114
是的，我想恐怕是的
Yeah, afraid so.

805
00:49:12,283 --> 00:49:15,160
那个毁了我的人生和我的的女儿的魔鬼
The man that ruined my life is a ghost and so is my daughter.

806
00:49:15,786 --> 00:49:17,954
我想在某些点上你的让故事继续
I guess at some point you just gotta let things go.

807
00:49:18,039 --> 00:49:19,039
不是吗？

当然不行
Fuck no.

809
00:49:24,587 --> 00:49:26,254
如果我把他摆到你面前？
What if I could put him in front of you?

810
00:49:27,715 --> 00:49:29,215
那个毁了你一生的男人。

811
00:49:30,176 --> 00:49:32,302
并且如果我能够像你保证
And if I could guarantee you

812
00:49:32,637 --> 00:49:33,887
你最好逃离他
that you'd get away with it.

813
00:49:36,182 --> 00:49:37,223
你会杀了他么？
Would you kill him?

814
00:49:39,810 --> 00:49:40,852
发自内心的
In a heartbeat.

我知道他在哪

00:49:48,361 --> 00:49:50,028
那你是怎么知道的啊？
And how the hell do you know that?

819
00:49:53,366 --> 00:49:54,366
那里有记录
There are records.

820
00:49:54,867 --> 00:49:57,869
医院记录，孤儿院记录，医疗记录...

Beth Fetherage。
Beth Fetherage.

823
00:50:02,249 --> 00:50:04,417
不是那个在孤儿院看门的人名字？
Wasn't that the name of your caretaker at the orphanage?

824
00:50:04,919 --> 00:50:05,919
Beth？
Beth?

825
00:50:07,672 --> 00:50:08,755
你这狗娘养的
You son of a bitch.

826
00:50:08,923 --> 00:50:10,006
你以前跟踪我？
Have you been following me?

827
00:50:10,091 --> 00:50:11,591
狗娘养的，这太搞笑了

Your name, as a woman, was Jane, right?

830
00:50:16,389 --> 00:50:18,723
你告诉我那个了，但是你没告诉我你作为男人的名字
You told me that. You didn't tell me your name as a man.

831
00:50:18,808 --> 00:50:21,726
John。顺便说一句，这不是太新颖
John. Which is not terribly original, by the way.

832
00:50:21,852 --> 00:50:23,019
你是谁？警察？还是其他什么人？

我能把这家伙打趴

你可以想做什么就做什么

835
00:50:28,859 --> 00:50:31,945
并且我保证你会逃离他

836
00:50:37,034 --> 00:50:38,201
好吧，他在哪？
All right, where is he?

837
00:50:41,789 --> 00:50:43,164
我为你做了些事情
I do something for you

838
00:50:43,833 --> 00:50:45,125
你就得为我做些什么
and you do something for me.

839

842
00:50:53,134 --> 00:50:54,134
我还能做什么？
What do I have to do?

843
00:50:54,343 --> 00:50:55,343
你喜欢你的工作？

额~~当然不
Hell, no.

845
00:50:56,762 --> 00:50:58,138
从来没有人给你一个喘息机会，对吗？
Nobody's ever given you a break, right?

846
00:50:58,848 --> 00:51:00,223
你听过我的故事吗？
Did you listen to my story?

847
00:51:00,474 --> 00:51:02,892
是的，在你服务训练期间你的优胜中

你有一些你从来没有机会发挥的技能
You have skills you've never had the chance to use

850
00:51:06,355 --> 00:51:07,731
而我能够给你那种机会

851
00:51:08,441 --> 00:51:09,441
让我以这种方式放下
Let me put it this way.

852

事成之后，你来做我的工作
And when you're done, you try my job.

854
00:51:14,530 --> 00:51:15,697
如果你不喜欢，你可以走人
You don't like it, you walk away.

855
00:51:18,242 --> 00:51:20,243
你不会在讨论当酒吧侍者吧？
You're not talking about bartending are you?

856
00:51:21,162 --> 00:51:23,163
我没有说关于酒吧侍者的事情
I'm not talking about bartending.

别耍我了，有话直说
Stop playing games. Just tell me right now.

861
00:51:30,129 --> 00:51:32,422
瞧，Robertson会比我解释的更加好。
Look, Robertson explains it so much better than I do.

862
00:51:34,842 --> 00:51:35,842
不要惹我
Don't mess with me.

863

哦，妈的
Oh, fuck.

871
00:52:09,043 --> 00:52:10,043
他在哪？
Where is he?

872
00:52:10,503 --> 00:52:11,503
什么，他在那里倒下了？
What, is he down there?

873
00:52:12,129 --> 00:52:14,130
听着，你仅仅是必须要相信我，好吗？
Listen, you're just going to have to trust me, all right?

874
00:52:15,216 --> 00:52:16,341
我现在一定是醉了
Now I must be drunk.

875

你最好别耍我
You better not be fucking with me.

876
00:52:20,221 --> 00:52:22,180
你想我是不是可能是闪灭炸弹人？
You think I might be the Fizzle Bomber?

877
00:52:22,556 --> 00:52:23,556
有可能
Maybe.

878
00:52:24,058 --> 00:52:25,433
假使你是闪灭炸弹人怎么样呢？
What if you're the Fizzle Bomber?

879
00:52:25,893 --> 00:52:26,935
如果我是？
What if I am?

880
00:52:28,062 --> 00:52:29,145
额~得了吧
Well, come on.

你在做神马？

你知道，杀了某人是不容易的
Killing somebody's not easy, you know.

890

No matter how much hate and anger you may have in your heart,

当扣动扳机的那一刻来临

大多数人做不到
most people can't do it.

893
00:53:12,147 --> 00:53:13,398
你根据经历说的？
You speaking from experience?

894
00:53:13,816 --> 00:53:15,441
我只是告诉你事实
I'm just telling you the truth.

944
00:55:26,949 --> 00:55:27,991
时间规划局？
The Temporal Bureau?

945
00:55:28,075 --> 00:55:29,450
是你效力的俱乐部吗？
Is that the company you work for?

946
00:55:29,576 --> 00:55:31,619
是的，是那家你几乎要转会的公司
That's right. The one you almost worked for.

947
00:55:32,287 --> 00:55:33,329
那么，Robertson人哩？
So, where's Robertson?

948
00:55:33,747 --> 00:55:35,123
他在1985年
He's in 1985.

949
00:55:35,833 --> 00:55:36,833
啥？
What?

950
00:55:37,251 --> 00:55:38,376
在规划局总部
At Bureau headquarters.

951
00:55:42,297 --> 00:55:44,007
那又怎样，你是个警察？
So what, you're a cop?

952
00:55:44,758 --> 00:55:46,467
我是一个时间特工，11人小组之一
I'm a Temporal Agent, one of 11.

953
00:55:46,677 --> 00:55:48,720
我们在犯罪发生之前阻止他们
We prevent crime before it takes place.

954
00:55:49,179 --> 00:55:51,389
看，这有些衣服，穿上他们
Here. Here's some clothes.
Put them on.

955
00:55:53,350 --> 00:55:55,268
额~你咋知道这会有衣服的？
Well, how did you know the clothes would be there?

956
00:55:55,436 --> 00:55:57,478
无关紧要，我们只需要开始调配进就行
Doesn't matter. We just need to start blending in.

957
00:55:58,147 --> 00:55:59,439
啥？你以前来过这？
What, have you been here before?

958
00:56:00,357 --> 00:56:01,691
这一句话讲不清，好吧
It's complicated, all right?

959
00:56:02,443 --> 00:56:03,443
好吧，我狗不理
Yeah, no shit.

960
00:56:03,569 --> 00:56:05,528
瞧，我们的时间上的破坏
Look, our time disruption footprint

961
00:56:05,612 --> 00:56:07,488
需要非常小
needs to be extremely small.

962
00:56:07,614 --> 00:56:09,991
时间规划局允许轻微的变化
The Bureau allows for slight variations

963
00:56:10,075 --> 00:56:12,076
但是最终的参数确是很严格的哦
but ultimately the parameters are extremely strict.

964
00:56:12,161 --> 00:56:14,495
任何我们任务的偏差会导致终结
Any deviation from our mission results in termination.

965
00:56:14,705 --> 00:56:16,205
终结你的工作？
Termination of your job?

966
00:56:16,290 --> 00:56:17,582
终结你的性命
Termination of your life.

967
00:56:18,083 --> 00:56:20,710
这就是为啥你想在这个时间段内保持和人谈话
That's why you want to keep your conversations to people in this time period

968
00:56:21,045 --> 00:56:22,420
到最低限度
to an absolute minimum.

969
00:56:23,130 --> 00:56:24,130
这个时间段
This time period.

970
00:56:25,174 --> 00:56:27,633
好。那么你最远能旅行多久？
Okay. So how far can you travel, then?

971
00:56:28,135 --> 00:56:32,138
从零点开始前后53年
Travel beyond 53 years of zero point, either direction,

972
00:56:32,556 --> 00:56:34,474
将会导致时间轨迹分解
will result in the temporal wake disintegrating.

973
00:56:34,683 --> 00:56:35,683
零点？
Zero point?

974
00:56:37,311 --> 00:56:38,603
开始时间旅行的地方
The invention of time travel.

975
00:56:38,729 --> 00:56:39,729
那是什么时候？
And when's that?

976
00:56:40,064 --> 00:56:42,356
将会是1981年
It will be in 1981.

977
00:56:44,485 --> 00:56:45,485
好的
Right.

978
00:56:46,487 --> 00:56:47,487
真难以置信
I can't believe this.

979
00:56:47,988 --> 00:56:49,030
那么
And so,

980
00:56:49,114 --> 00:56:52,116
我可能成为其中一份子，你知道的，一个时间特工？
I get to be one of these, you know, a Temporal Agent?

981
00:56:52,701 --> 00:56:54,118
如果你证明你自己
If you prove yourself.

982
00:56:55,746 --> 00:56:56,746
好。
Right.

983
00:56:58,749 --> 00:57:00,166
那么这个对于你，这家伙是什么
So what's this guy to you?

984
00:57:00,417 --> 00:57:03,586
嗯~我开始怀疑他就是闪灭炸弹人，是吗？
Well, I'm starting to suspect that he might be the Fizzle Bomber. All right?

985
00:57:03,754 --> 00:57:06,672
但是很明显，他是你主要的棘手困难所在
But all that's clear is he's the main obstacle that's held you back.

986
00:57:07,674 --> 00:57:09,509
因此，我杀了他
So, I kill him

987
00:57:10,344 --> 00:57:11,552
你把我带去找Robertson
you take me to Robertson

988
00:57:11,637 --> 00:57:12,762
然后给我看一切
and you show me everything.

989
00:57:13,138 --> 00:57:14,138
成交
Agreed.

990
00:57:15,182 --> 00:57:16,682
好，那么他在哪？
Right. Okay, so where is he?

991
00:57:16,767 --> 00:57:18,142
好。嘿，嘿
Okay. Hey, hey.

992
00:57:18,852 --> 00:57:19,852
你还好吗？
Are you all right?

993
00:57:20,604 --> 00:57:21,604
是的
Yeah.

994
00:57:22,397 --> 00:57:25,233
好的，他在克利夫兰学院，从这里起五个街区
All right, he's at Cleveland College,
five blocks from here.

995
00:57:25,359 --> 00:57:27,860
你记得？他在找Jane的路上，找你！
You remember? He's on his way
to meet Jane. You.

996
00:57:28,153 --> 00:57:29,695
1963年的你
The 1963 you.

997
00:57:29,863 --> 00:57:30,988
是的，我记得
Yeah, I remember.

998
00:57:31,073 --> 00:57:32,073
好，太棒了
Okay, great.

999
00:57:33,867 --> 00:57:37,829
那么，我能够做这个？我能改变我的过去？
So, I can do this?
I can change my past?

1000
00:57:38,205 --> 00:57:39,205
是的，你可以
Yes, you can.

1001
00:57:40,415 --> 00:57:42,250
你有想过改变你的过去吗？
Have you ever thought about changing yours?

1002
00:57:43,669 --> 00:57:45,294
我从不偏离我的任务
I never deviate from the mission.

1003
00:57:47,589 --> 00:57:49,340
-从不？
-从不
- Never?
- Never.

1004
00:57:51,552 --> 00:57:53,511
瞧，当你完事了，我去接你，好吗？
Look, I'll pick you up when you're done, all right?

1005
00:57:53,595 --> 00:57:55,138
不，谁？你去哪？
No. Whoa, where are you going?

1006
00:57:55,264 --> 00:57:57,473
不要担心，我很快回来，相信我
Don't worry. I'll be around, trust me.

1007
00:57:57,558 --> 00:57:58,558
我能...
Do I...

1008
00:58:00,310 --> 00:58:01,602
我有的选么？
Do I have a choice?

1009
00:58:02,146 --> 00:58:03,896
是的，你总是有选择的
Of course. You always have a choice.

1010
00:58:04,398 --> 00:58:06,899
是的，但是有时候你不认为是命中注定的么？
Yeah, but sometimes don't you think that things are just inevitable?

1011
00:58:09,236 --> 00:58:10,987
是的，这种想法我脑海中闪过
Yes, the thought has crossed my mind.

1012
00:58:14,116 --> 00:58:15,825
这就是人生
This life.

1013
00:58:16,743 --> 00:58:17,743
她孤单么？
Is it Ionely?

1014
00:58:21,957 --> 00:58:22,957
没有家庭
No family.

1015
00:58:24,585 --> 00:58:25,585
没
No.

1016
00:58:27,254 --> 00:58:29,630
但是，你确实有个目的
But, you do have a purpose.

1017
00:58:33,886 --> 00:58:34,886
是的
Right.

1018
00:59:25,145 --> 00:59:26,187
哦，我很抱歉
Oh, I'm so sorry.

1019
00:59:27,981 --> 00:59:29,023
你迷路了？
Are you lost?

1020
00:59:30,317 --> 00:59:31,609
不，我在找一个人
No, I'm looking for someone.

1021
00:59:32,069 --> 00:59:33,736
谢谢，我仅仅在等待
Thanks, I'll just wait.

1022
00:59:33,820 --> 00:59:36,864
好，你知道他们说机会是给有准备的人的
Well, you know what they say about good things happening to those who wait.

1023
00:59:43,497 --> 00:59:46,207
但收获的都是那些努力的人剩下的东西
But only the things left behind by those who hustle.

1024
00:59:53,632 --> 00:59:55,466
我也是这么想的
I was thinking the exact same thing.

1025
00:59:56,260 --> 00:59:57,260
差别是什么？
What are the odds?

1026
01:00:00,138 --> 01:00:01,180
差别是什么。
What are the odds.

1027
01:00:04,643 --> 01:00:05,643
你还好吗？
Are you okay?

1028
01:00:07,729 --> 01:00:09,855
你不知道我是怎么想象你的容颜
You're not how I imagined you'd look.

1029
01:00:11,984 --> 01:00:12,984
我认识你吗？
Do I know you?

1030
01:00:16,446 --> 01:00:17,530
你真美
You're beautiful.

1031
01:00:21,618 --> 01:00:23,244
某人应该已经告诉过你了
Someone should have told you that.

1032
01:00:27,374 --> 01:00:28,541
是的，你刚才说过了
Well, you just did.

1033
01:00:42,514 --> 01:00:44,890
<i>如果曾经想阻止闪灭炸弹人</i>
<i>If you ever want to stop the Fizzle Bomber</i>

1034
01:00:45,809 --> 01:00:47,393
<i>你将永远没有第二次机会</i>
<i>you'll never get another chance.</i>

1035
01:04:39,793 --> 01:04:40,793
来吧，来吧
Come on, come on.

1036
01:05:27,882 --> 01:05:30,384
<i>有时候你不觉得这是命中注定的么？</i>
<i>Sometimes don't you think that things are just inevitable?</i>

1037
01:05:32,470 --> 01:05:34,513
<i>是的，这种想法我脑海中闪过</i>
<i>Yes, the thought has crossed my mind.</i>

1038
01:05:47,694 --> 01:05:49,778
时间旅行可以失去方向
Time travel can be disorienting.

1039
01:05:50,572 --> 01:05:52,865
即使小的时空跳跃也能造成蝴蝶效应
Even short jumps can knock you around a bit.

1040
01:05:53,908 --> 01:05:55,868
不要尝试跳跃极限
Don't ever exceed the jump limit.

1041
01:05:57,120 --> 01:05:58,871
会出问题的
It can be problematic.

1042
01:06:01,166 --> 01:06:02,416
深呼吸
Deep breaths.

1043
01:06:03,209 --> 01:06:04,501
<i>这招总是管用</i>
<i>They always help.</i>

1044
01:06:13,720 --> 01:06:15,721
我不出去，见很多新人
I don't get out and meet a lot of new people.

1045
01:06:19,934 --> 01:06:20,934
为什么不呢？
Why not?

1046
01:06:23,647 --> 01:06:24,813
我不知道，我只是不想
I don't know. I just don't.

1047
01:06:31,988 --> 01:06:33,072
你紧张了？
Are you nervous?

1048
01:06:35,116 --> 01:06:36,116
<i>哦，是的</i>
<i>Oh, yeah.</i>

1049
01:06:36,451 --> 01:06:39,203
<i>不要忘了买顶帽子，手套和夹克</i>
<i>Don't forget to buy a hat, gloves and a jacket.</i>

1050
01:06:39,454 --> 01:06:41,747
回到64年，这时候真冷啊
It's cold this time of year, back in '64.

1051
01:06:43,750 --> 01:06:46,043
这是一个工作，对吗？记住它
This is a job, all right? Remember that.

1052
01:06:46,127 --> 01:06:49,213
这个不像其他的，但是你仍然有任务在截止日前
It's unlike any other, but you still have tasks to perform

1053
01:06:49,297 --> 01:06:50,422
执行完
deadlines to meet.

1054
01:06:50,715 --> 01:06:52,716
一些日子里这些任务对于他人而言很容易
Some days those tasks are easier than others

1055
01:06:52,801 --> 01:06:55,177
但是你的成功确是很有必要的
but it's imperative that you succeed.

1056
01:06:59,683 --> 01:07:01,684
<i>你总是知道这一天将要来临</i>
<i>You always knew this day would come.</i>

1057
01:07:06,773 --> 01:07:07,856
你不能做这个
You can do this.

1058
01:07:09,859 --> 01:07:11,068
<i>你为什么不去见新的人？</i>
<i>Why don't you meet new people?</i>

1059
01:07:13,530 --> 01:07:15,489
我不善于社交
I'm not very good in social situations.

1060
01:07:15,699 --> 01:07:17,157
我想一些人也不像我
Some people just don't like me, I guess.

1061
01:07:17,701 --> 01:07:18,784
何出此言，你这么认为？
Why is that, do you think?

1062
01:07:19,452 --> 01:07:20,452
我不知道
I don't know.

1063
01:07:21,287 --> 01:07:22,955
也许是因为你觉得你比别人优秀
Perhaps it's because you think you're better than them.

1064
01:07:24,290 --> 01:07:25,290
我没听错吧？
Excuse me?

1065
01:07:26,960 --> 01:07:28,210
恩~你觉得你很优秀
Well, you think you're superior.

1066
01:07:29,170 --> 01:07:30,796
你去找谁...
Who the hell are you to...

1067
01:07:31,005 --> 01:07:32,005
你甚至不认识我
You don't even know me.

1068
01:07:32,090 --> 01:07:33,090
我错了么？
Am I wrong?

1069
01:07:35,593 --> 01:07:36,844
拿一个去了解另一个
Takes one to know one.

1070
01:07:38,930 --> 01:07:39,930
是的
True.

1071
01:07:44,602 --> 01:07:45,978
那么，什么使得你如此优越？
So, what makes you so superior?

1072
01:07:51,067 --> 01:07:52,234
我会读心术
I can read minds.

1073
01:07:53,069 --> 01:07:54,153
哦，真的？
Oh, really?

1074
01:07:54,863 --> 01:07:56,321
是的，完全可以
Yeah, absolutely.

1075
01:07:56,906 --> 01:07:58,574
好吧，此时此刻我在想啥？
All right, what am I thinking right now?

1076
01:08:05,999 --> 01:08:07,082
你在想
You're thinking,

1077
01:08:07,876 --> 01:08:10,169
优雅课程在这里不管用了
"Charm class isn't helping this situation."

1078
01:08:11,379 --> 01:08:13,130
哇，真的很神奇！
Wow. Amazing.

1079
01:08:14,549 --> 01:08:15,674
你在想
You're thinking,

1080
01:08:17,677 --> 01:08:20,679
为啥别人都能得到想要的，而我不行？
"Why does everyone always get what they want and I get nothing?

1081
01:08:21,014 --> 01:08:22,723
我总是各种苦逼
"That I'm tired of being tough all the time."

1082
01:08:24,934 --> 01:08:26,018
每个人都那么想
Everyone thinks that.

1083
01:08:27,771 --> 01:08:29,062
你假装爱情
You pretend like love

1084
01:08:30,023 --> 01:08:31,940
与你一点关系没有，而真相是
doesn't matter to you, when the truth is

1085
01:08:32,025 --> 01:08:33,859
你总是在渴望着
it's all you ever think about.

1086
01:08:34,068 --> 01:08:35,068
那不对！
That's not true.

1087
01:08:37,530 --> 01:08:38,530
好吧
Okay.

1088
01:08:38,948 --> 01:08:40,115
什么，你不相信我？
What, you don't believe me?

1089
01:08:40,366 --> 01:08:41,742
你仅仅只了解我一个小时而已
You've known me for a whole hour.

1090
01:08:42,827 --> 01:08:44,203
你从未坠入过爱河
You've never been in love.

1091
01:08:44,913 --> 01:08:46,079
那与你无关
That's none of your business.

1092
01:08:46,706 --> 01:08:48,040
这不能算一个回答
That's not an answer.

1093
01:08:48,124 --> 01:08:49,625
什么使你认为你应当得到一个（爱情）？
What makes you think you deserve one?

1094
01:08:51,753 --> 01:08:52,753
你说的很对
You're right.

1095
01:08:53,546 --> 01:08:54,922
对于我的直接，我很抱歉
I'm sorry for being so direct.

1096
01:09:00,720 --> 01:09:02,888
你说我不像你想象的那样
You said that I'm not how you imagined.

1097
01:09:03,139 --> 01:09:04,223
我们以前认识吗？
Have we met before?

1098
01:09:04,808 --> 01:09:05,891
不，我...
No, I...

1099
01:09:07,227 --> 01:09:08,602
我不知道为啥我会那么说
I don't know why I said that.

1100
01:09:08,686 --> 01:09:09,895
因为我感到我们有
Because I feel like we have.

1101
01:09:11,981 --> 01:09:13,899
生活对于你不容易吧，是不？
Things haven't been easy for you, have they?

1102
01:09:16,736 --> 01:09:17,986
每个人都有问题
Everyone's got problems.

1103

<i>Yeah.</i>
<i>是的</i>

1104
01:09:20,406 --> 01:09:22,074
<i>我们都会羁绊在人生路上</i>
<i>We all trip up along the way.</i>

1105
01:09:23,326 --> 01:09:24,618
但是你和我，
But you and I,

1106
01:09:26,621 --> 01:09:28,247
或许跨越了同样的东西
perhaps over the same things.

1107
01:09:30,250 --> 01:09:32,209
<i>Robertson先生，再次见到你很高兴</i>
<i>Mr. Robertson, it's good to see you again.</i>

1108
01:09:32,794 --> 01:09:33,877
已经有一会了
It's been a while.

1109
01:09:35,088 --> 01:09:36,088
是的
Yes.

1110
01:09:38,758 --> 01:09:40,384
从你的角度，我认为是的
From your perspective, I suppose it has.

1111
01:09:41,094 --> 01:09:42,761
我不认为你能够再跳跃了
I didn't think you jumped anymore.

1112
01:09:43,221 --> 01:09:44,805
除非特殊情况发生
Only on special occasions.

1113

我有了一片“闪灭炸弹人”定时器的碎片
I have a piece of the Fizzle Bomber's timer.

1114
01:09:56,818 --> 01:09:59,319
你进行了非法时空跳跃，这是很严重的过错。
You made an illegal jump. That's a serious offense.

1115
01:09:59,863 --> 01:10:01,238
这已经无关紧要了
It doesn't matter anymore.

1116
01:10:02,240 --> 01:10:03,699
我必须再试一把
I had to try again.

1117
01:10:03,908 --> 01:10:05,075
你理解他么？
And did you apprehend him?

1118
01:10:05,577 --> 01:10:06,577
不
No.

1119
01:10:08,288 --> 01:10:11,331
每次进行时空跳跃你身后留下的碎片
The fragments of matter you leave behind after each jump

1120
01:10:11,416 --> 01:10:13,166
我们只能修复很多
we can only repair so much.

1121

开始精神、智障分析
The onset of psychosis, dementia.

1122
01:10:15,879 --> 01:10:17,004
这是认真的
It can be serious.

1123
01:10:17,839 --> 01:10:18,839
我很好
I'm fine.

1124
01:10:19,132 --> 01:10:20,841
你经历了多少次非法时空跳跃？
How many illegal jumps have you made?

1125
01:10:21,092 --> 01:10:22,092
就一次
Just one.

1126
01:10:22,927 --> 01:10:23,927
我将接受惩罚
I'll accept the punishment.

1127
01:10:29,100 --> 01:10:33,437
规划局参数设置很严格，这是有理由的
The parameters set by the Bureau are strict for a reason.

1128
01:10:33,813 --> 01:10:35,814
他们存在是为了保护我们
They exist for our protection.

1129
01:10:37,817 --> 01:10:38,901
然而
However,

1130
01:10:40,069 --> 01:10:42,988
我总是在想我们能够完成如此之多
I've always thought we could accomplish so much more

1131
01:10:43,072 --> 01:10:46,450
不受规划局委员会的限制
without the constant bureaucratic control of the board.

一个特种在外操作

<i>她将经历如此多的痛苦，全赖我</i>
<i>She'll endure so much pain because of what I do.</i>

1134
01:10:58,463 --> 01:11:00,005
这是命运的选择
That's the way it has to be.

1135
01:11:01,007 --> 01:11:02,341
这是命中注定
That's the way it's always been.

1136
01:11:03,718 --> 01:11:05,844
你应该比任何人都明白
You should understand that better than anyone.

1137
01:11:08,222 --> 01:11:10,974
蛇咬尾，无穷无尽
The snake that eats its own tail, forever and ever.

1138
01:11:11,976 --> 01:11:14,937
你在这里创造历史，影响未来
You are here to create history and influence what is to come.

1139
01:11:15,271 --> 01:11:16,939
我不认为我能做什么
I don't think I can do it.

1140
01:11:18,274 --> 01:11:19,274
明白
Understand

1141
01:11:19,359 --> 01:11:20,776
你不仅仅是一个特工
you are more than an Agent.

1142
01:11:20,860 --> 01:11:21,818
你有天赋
You're a gift

1143
01:11:21,903 --> 01:11:23,320
给予这个世界打破
given to the world through a

宿命悖论
Predestination Paradox.

1145
01:11:25,949 --> 01:11:27,282
你是唯一的一个人
You're the only one

1146
01:11:27,367 --> 01:11:29,910
从历史、祖先中解放

公鸡
The rooster.

1148
01:11:36,751 --> 01:11:38,251
但是你必须完成你的任务
But you must complete your mission.

1149
01:11:38,336 --> 01:11:40,003
你必须为未来埋下种子
You must lay the seeds for the future.

1150
01:11:40,880 --> 01:11:42,005
我们就全靠你了
We're counting on you.

1151
01:11:45,051 --> 01:11:48,470
而当什么发生了才能让我能有天不知道我的未来如何
And what happens when that day comes, when I have no knowledge of my future?

1152
01:11:52,934 --> 01:11:54,017
好吧，就像其他人一样
Well, then, like everyone else

1153
01:11:54,102 --> 01:11:56,144
你正准备某天某时不得不拿走她
you're just going to have to take it one day at a time.

1154
01:12:38,271 --> 01:12:42,357
你面前是一个很长的旅途
You have a long journey ahead of you.

千里之路始于足下

1157
01:13:02,128 --> 01:13:04,004
而我的双脚能够用来休息

好吧，仅仅闭上你的眼睛
All right, just going to cover up your eyes

1159
01:13:19,604 --> 01:13:22,272
仅仅为了安全，好吗？

1162
01:13:28,654 --> 01:13:29,654
你准备好了吗？
You ready?

1163
01:13:29,739 --> 01:13:32,282
<i>记住，深呼吸</i>

不要担心

选择是你的

我不打算离开她

这就是这样，就这样了
That's the way that it is.

命里注定就这样的

如果你觉得被骗了，对不起
I'm sorry if you feel deceived.

1186
01:16:29,252 --> 01:16:32,337
但是我们能够改变某些事件，这是个错误。
But it's a mistake to think that we can change certain events.

1187
01:16:32,630 --> 01:16:35,006
就像你说的，某些东西是命中注定的
Just like you said, some things are inevitable.

我知道是这样
I know that.

1190

并且你明白你是谁

震动将会减弱
The shock will wear off

1196
01:17:03,786 --> 01:17:06,621
但是你知道这些事情以后能够安慰自己

朝着正确的方向发展
are happening in the correct order.

我不想离开她
I don't want to leave her.

1202

你没有
You're not.

1203

你的麻烦就结了

你将从事对于一个男人而言最重要的工作
You're about to embark on the most important job a man has ever had.

01:17:58,924 --> 01:18:01,343
而你将变得伟大，我知道
And you're going to do great. I know.

All right, he's forward jumped 22 years.

他不习惯如此长的距离
He's not used to this kind of distance.

John不得不去想这些

01:27:12,644 --> 01:27:14,770
不，我很好奇
No, I'm curious.

1345
01:27:15,439 --> 01:27:16,814
你上报过
Did you report

1346
01:27:17,232 --> 01:27:20,318
你的退役的时间机器没有退役？
that your decommissioned Field Kit didn't decommission?

1347
01:27:21,820 --> 01:27:22,820
对吗？
Right?

1348
01:27:23,447 --> 01:27:25,656
一些人说，那不是命运
Some people say that it's fate.

1349
01:27:26,658 --> 01:27:27,950
但是你和我
But you and I,

1350
01:27:28,493 --> 01:27:29,493
我们知道
we know

1351
01:27:29,745 --> 01:27:31,454
有些事情命中注定
some things are predestined.

1352
01:27:31,872 --> 01:27:34,582
我成就了你，你成就了我
I made you who you are. You made me who I am.

1353
01:27:34,666 --> 01:27:35,917
这是个悖论，对吗？
It's a paradox, right?

1354
01:27:36,001 --> 01:27:37,835
但是不能够被打破了
But it can't be paradoctored.

1355
01:27:39,463 --> 01:27:40,504
对吗？
Right?

1356
01:27:40,672 --> 01:27:43,674
我很高兴能先占有你，我确实这么想
I had so much fun at preempting you, I did.

1357
01:27:43,842 --> 01:27:46,344
而今你自由了却来找了我
And now you're free and you found me

1358
01:27:46,845 --> 01:27:48,804
我们可以一起打天下
and we can be together.

1359
01:27:49,348 --> 01:27:50,640
我才不屑成为你
I'll never become you.

1360
01:27:50,724 --> 01:27:51,724
别那么说
Don't say that.

1361
01:27:51,892 --> 01:27:52,892
别那么说
Don't say that.

1362
01:27:53,602 --> 01:27:54,602
我们只是傀儡
We're just puppets.

1363
01:27:55,938 --> 01:27:57,480
我们是Robertson
We are Robertson.

1364
01:27:57,564 --> 01:27:58,689
他策划了整件事
He set the whole thing up.

1365
01:27:59,983 --> 01:28:01,025
他玩弄我们于股掌之间
He played us for fools.

1366
01:28:01,276 --> 01:28:02,693
他触发了多米诺骨牌效应
He's laying out the dominoes.

1367
01:28:02,778 --> 01:28:04,445
你知道，咱们只能看着牌倒下去
You know, we're just watching it fall.

1368
01:28:04,529 --> 01:28:06,822
我不会变成你
I will never become you

1369
01:28:06,907 --> 01:28:09,784
我也不会让你去杀人
and I will not let you kill those people.

1370
01:28:09,868 --> 01:28:10,868
等等，等等，等
Wait, wait, wait.

1371
01:28:11,036 --> 01:28:13,371
什么，你准备回归以前的生活？
What, you're gonna live a regular life

1372
01:28:13,455 --> 01:28:16,374
和那个贱人Alice，在古玩店？
with that bitch, Alice, from the antique store?

1373
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:18,668
她有个二B猫
She has a stupid cat,

1374
01:28:18,752 --> 01:28:21,963
她左边屁股上有个恶心的胎记
she has a disgusting birthmark on her left hip.

1375
01:28:22,047 --> 01:28:23,714
她做的菜我无力吐槽
She's a lousy fucking cook.

1376
01:28:23,799 --> 01:28:24,799
好吧，相信我
Okay, trust me.

1377
01:28:24,883 --> 01:28:26,634
她不能把持我们的秘密
She can't handle our secrets.

1378
01:28:26,718 --> 01:28:28,970
她不能，相信我。她和我们不是一路人
She can't, trust me. She's not right for us.

1379
01:28:29,429 --> 01:28:33,474
你不知道什么对我而言才是正确的
You have no idea what is right for me.

1380
01:28:33,558 --> 01:28:36,811
好，好，好，我们是好基友
Okay, okay, okay, all we have is each other.

1381
01:28:36,895 --> 01:28:39,563
这就是我们曾经拥有的
It is all we've ever had.

1382
01:28:40,315 --> 01:28:41,774
那，如果你朝我开枪
Now if you shoot me

1383
01:28:42,609 --> 01:28:43,693
你将变成我
you'll become me.

1384
01:28:44,611 --> 01:28:45,736
你的，明白？
You get it?

1385
01:28:45,821 --> 01:28:47,405
那就是它如何发生的
That's how it happens.

1386
01:28:47,614 --> 01:28:49,490
如果你想打破循环
If you want to break the chain

1387
01:28:49,825 --> 01:28:51,367
你就不能杀我
you have to not kill me

1388
01:28:52,577 --> 01:28:56,580
而是再次的爱我
but try to love me, again.

1389
01:28:58,792 --> 01:29:00,418
如果我把他放到你面前
What if I put him in front of you,

1390
01:29:01,420 --> 01:29:03,254
那个毁了你一生的男人...
the man who ruined your life...

1391
01:29:05,841 --> 01:29:06,841
别扯犊子了
Forget all that.

1392
01:29:06,925 --> 01:29:08,759
我们能够一起有个未来
We can have a future together.

1393
01:29:09,428 --> 01:29:10,428
你会杀了他
Would you kill him

1394
01:29:10,929 --> 01:29:12,388
去拯救千万生命？
to save thousands?

1395
01:29:12,472 --> 01:29:14,056
你想知道我们打算明天做什么？
You wanna know what we're gonna do tomorrow?

1396
01:29:16,601 --> 01:29:17,601
不
No.

1397
01:29:40,042 --> 01:29:41,042
<i>给你</i>

并且你明白你是谁
