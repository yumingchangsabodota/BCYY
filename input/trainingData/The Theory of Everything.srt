快點  老頭子
Come on, old man.

5
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:23,000
再不快點就晚了
I think we're going to be late!

6
00:01:25,810 --> 00:01:27,670
我全速前進呢  布萊恩
Fire's on the rocket, Brian.

7

布萊恩找到了空隙

太慢了
Too slow.

我第一個喝到酒  你好啊
First to find a drink, yeah. Hello.

14
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,360
要是宇宙的奧秘跟性有關
What if the secret of the universe has something to do with sex.

15
00:02:10,170 --> 00:02:13,370
你博士論文就寫這個吧  愛之物理學
Maybe do your doctorate on that? The physics of love.

16
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:16,070
-那是你的研究領域吧  -最近沒怎麼研究了
- I think that's more your field, Brian. - Not lately.

17
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:18,940
你要是再定不下來  就要被請出去了
They will boot you out, you know, if you don't decide.

18
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:22,620
我認識這裡所有的...棒極了
I know everybody here who's... brilliant.

19

居然是科學家們
Oh, dear, scientists!

20
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:31,090
別擔心  不會待太久的
Don't worry, we don't have to stay long...

21
00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:32,600
簡直無聊到死
looks mortifyingly dull.

22
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:40,270
-沒勁  -那是誰
- Bores. - Who's that?

23
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:43,050
哪個  他嗎
Who's who? Oh, him?

24
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:49,300
他可怪了  不過他也去了抗議核遊行[1960年代]
He's strange. However, he goes to ban the bomb marches.

25

32
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:30,200
-宇宙學家  我是個宇宙學家  -那是什麼
- Cosmologist, I'm a cosmologist. - What's that?

33
00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:32,160
就是特別聰明的  不信上帝的人

-信的宗教  -聰明的不信上帝的

37
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:44,000
-就是英國國教[聖公會]  -是啊
- Church of England. - England, yes.

38
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:48,270
總得有個信教的
I suppose someone has to be.

39
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:51,270
那宇宙學家信奉什麼呢
So, what do cosmologists worship then?

40
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:52,740
信奉什麼
What do we worship?

41
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:54,430
用一個統一的方程
One single unifying equation

42
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:56,660
來解釋宇宙萬物
that explains everything in the universe.

43
00:03:56,710 --> 00:03:58,170
-是嗎  -是
- Really. - Yes.

44
00:03:58,340 --> 00:03:59,400
是什麼方程
What's the equation?

45
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:02,040
問題就在這
That is the question.

46
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:06,840
這個問題非常好  我還沒想出來
And a very good question. I'm not quite sure yet.

47
00:04:07,770 --> 00:04:10,000
但我想研究這個
But I intend to find out.

48
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,840
那你為什麼去牛津啊
Then why do you even stay at Oxford?

49
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,970
因為我的期末考試
Because my finals exams are such a

50
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:24,440
考得一塌糊塗  他們叫我參加個口試
shambles that the examiners they settled me in for a "Viva",

51
00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:27,600
-他們如果我拿到二等  -口試是什麼
- And they told me that if I go up a second... - What's a "Viva"?

52
00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:30,820
有點恐怖  跟人面對面坐下來什麼的
A sort of, mildly terrifying face-to-face thingy.

53
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:33,570
-面試嗎  -審訊吧
- As an interview? - An interrogation.

54
00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:36,650
我告訴他們  如果給我二等學位[參考片尾注釋]
And I told them that if they gave me a 2nd class degree

55
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:39,270
我就得留在牛津做研究
then I'd stay with them and do my research at Oxford,

56
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:42,570
如果給我一等學位  我就能去劍橋了
but if they gave me the 1st, I needed to get into Cambridge, then

57
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:45,070
他們就能永遠甩掉我了
they would never have to see me again.

58
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:49,360
-所以他們給了你一等  -沒錯
- They gave you the 1st. - They gave me the 1st.

59
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:53,460
-是啊  -派對已經正式結束了
- Of course. - This party is officially deceased.

60
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,970
來吧  我找輛車送你回家
Come on, I've fixed you up a ride home.

61
00:04:57,310 --> 00:05:01,990
走啊  簡  簡
Come on, Jane... Jane?

62
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:04,770
-跟你聊天很開心  -我也是
- Well, it was lovely to talk to you. - Yes.

63
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:09,870
還有  希望你能找到那個方程
And... I hope you find your equation.

64
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:11,530
是啊
Yes... oh...

65
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:16,820
-再見  -再見
- Bye. - G'bye.

66

給你們的小測試
a little challenge for you all,

70
00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:45,760
在你們的學術研究路上...
as you embark upon your separate doctoral journeys...

71
00:05:45,770 --> 00:05:47,870
不管你們打算研究什麼  霍金先生
whatever they may be, Mr. Hawking.

72
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:49,940
傳下去
Pass them down.

73
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:52,170
來看看你們是男人還是男孩
Something to separate the men from the boys,

74
00:05:52,170 --> 00:05:53,380
是糧食還是糟糠
the wheat from the chaff,

75
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:56,980
介子還是π介子  真誇克[基本粒子之一]還是假行家
the mesons from the pi-mesons, the quarks from the quacks.

76
00:05:57,100 --> 00:06:00,850
十個問題  一個比一個難
Ten questions, each more impregnable than the last.

77
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:05,300
祝你們好運吧  週五三點再見
Good luck, you'll need it. Shall we say Friday at 3 o'clock?

78
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,910
我要做到癱瘓了
This is going to hospitalize me.

79
00:06:11,590 --> 00:06:17,450
好了  劃  劃  劃  劃
All right! Row! Row! Row! Row!

80
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:22,150
使勁劃  布萊恩  加油啊
Row it out, Brian! Come on, Brian!

81
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:26,740
劃  布萊恩  加油
Row, Brian! Come on! Row, Brian.

82
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:29,230
向前進  布萊恩
Straight on, Brian!

83
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:40,100
再來兩杯這個
Can I get two more of those, please?

84
00:06:40,270 --> 00:06:42,740
-換點零錢打個電話  -好的

86
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:06,770
猜我那天碰到誰了  卡洛琳
You'll never guess who I saw the other day... Caroline.

87
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:11,340
她好像有男朋友了  不過她愛約誰約誰
I think she was having a date, she can have him, quite frankly.

88
00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:13,730
這概率有多大
What's the probability?

89
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:16,250
小的不得了
Reasonably low.

90
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:21,100
這個  這是斯蒂芬
Uh... this is... this is Stephen.

是啊  跟上帝[做禮拜]

好吧
Okay.

96

快起床  你做出了幾個

98
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,620
那幾個問題你做出幾個
How many of the possible questions did you do?

99
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:14,800
布萊恩  你在說什麼啊
Brian, I have no idea what you're talking about.

100
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:17,270
夏瑪的問題  你做出幾個  斯蒂芬
How many of Sciama's questions did you get, Stephen?

101

-沒做  -一個沒做嗎
- None. - You didn't get any?

102
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:21,900
我一會再做
I was going to do them later.

103
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:23,220
你看都沒看
You haven't even looked at them.

104
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:24,270
沒看
No.

105
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:25,900
斯蒂芬  你知道自己
Stephen, are you aware that

106
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:28,090
是自願攻讀物理學博士學位的吧
you've voluntarily embarked on a PhD in physics?

107
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:29,570
還是在英國最頂尖的大學裡
At the most prestigious college in England?

108
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:30,320
知道
Yes.

109
00:08:30,370 --> 00:08:33,140
還以為入學典禮時候你睡著了呢
Oh! Thought maybe you'd slept through the induction or something.

110
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:37,640
布萊恩
Brian?

111
00:08:38,540 --> 00:08:41,490
-怎麼了  -放段瓦格納吧
- What? - Can you whip on some Wagner?

112
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:43,330
一邊去
Sod off!

113
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:31,140
-請進  斯蒂芬  -抱歉
- Come in, Stephen. - Sorry.

114
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:34,480
邁克  你這亂成一坨
Michael, that's so illegible

115
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:37,060
我也不知道你錯了多少  估計是不少
I can't quite decipher how wrong it is, I suspect enormously,

116
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:40,280
布萊恩  看不懂你寫的什麼
and Brian... that's just baffling.

117
00:09:40,570 --> 00:09:43,690
-您受累做了沒  -抱歉
- Have you even bothered to? - Oh, sorry.

列車時刻表
Train time tables.

119
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:56,540
這怎麼行  這時刻表都過期了
It's certainly unacceptable, these expired a month ago.

120
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,920
在背面  我出了點事
It's on the back, I had a little accident.

121
00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:07,650
只能做出九個
I could only do nine.

122
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:15,010
好吧  謝天謝地  那個

斯蒂芬  坐吧
Oh, Stephen, take a seat.

126
00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:41,750
我想談談你的課題
I wanted to talk to you about your subject.

127
00:10:41,950 --> 00:10:46,660
我們都等著你決定研究方向呢
We're all rather concerned as to what it's going to be.

128
00:10:46,830 --> 00:10:48,230
我定不下來
I can't decide.

129
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:54,790
有什麼想法嗎
Do you have any ideas?

130
00:10:56,540 --> 00:10:58,010
沒有
No.

131
00:11:17,530 --> 00:11:22,670
湯普森在這發現了電子[1897年]
This is where J.J. Thomson discovered the electron,

132
00:11:22,670 --> 00:11:26,290
盧瑟福在這分裂了原子核[1909年]
and where Rutherford split the atom.

133
00:11:28,930 --> 00:11:31,990
在劍橋搞研究的好處就是  你永遠都不知道
You know, one of the great rewards of this job is one never knows

134
00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:33,710
誰  在哪裡
from where the next great

135
00:11:33,710 --> 00:11:36,600
能搞出個重大發現來
leap forward is going to come, or from whom.

136
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:44,530
下週五  我要帶幾個優秀研究生去倫敦

140
00:12:44,190 --> 00:12:46,660
聽說你從沒去過教堂
So, I gather you've never been to church?

141
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:50,460
-很久以前去過  -想信教嗎
- Once upon a time. - Tempted to convert?

142
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:53,800
我不太信這種統領萬物的神
I have a slight problem with the whole Celestial Dictator premise.

143
00:12:54,390 --> 00:12:59,090
你午飯有安排嗎  我媽烤的肉特別好吃
Now, what are you doing for lunch? Ma makes a cracking roast.

144
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:06,810
簡  你是學什麼的

151
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:26,600
-我喜歡特納  -特納嗎
- Well, I like Turner. - Turner, really?

152
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:28,530
我一直覺得他的畫
You know, I always feel that his

153
00:13:28,530 --> 00:13:31,400
像是被暴雨泡了好幾天
paintings look as if they've been left out in the rain.

154
00:13:32,730 --> 00:13:34,690

別試  別試  簡
Don't touch it, don't touch it, Jane.

157
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:42,330
謝謝  他媽呢
Thank you. Mother.

158
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:46,500
斯蒂芬不喜歡我自己釀的酒  菲麗西汀呢
Stephen doesn't like my homemade wine...Philistine.

159
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:49,720
給你塞幾瓶帶回學校
I'm going to send you back with a couple of bottles.

160
00:13:49,770 --> 00:13:53,000
斯蒂芬  你和這位善良的女士去了教堂
So, Stephen, you have come to church with a good woman.

161
00:13:53,050 --> 00:13:55,090
覺得自己聖潔嗎
Are you feeling holier than thou?

162
00:13:55,890 --> 00:13:58,960
非常聖潔  謝謝
Positively saintly... thank you.

163
00:13:59,130 --> 00:14:01,200
你還沒說自己為什麼不信上帝
You haven't said why you don't believe in God.

164
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:04,200
物理學家的研究
A physicist can't allow his calculations

165
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:06,600
不能受超自然的創世主影響
to be muddled by a belief in a supernatural creator.

166
00:14:06,730 --> 00:14:10,420
你說得像是在指責物理學家啊
Sounds less of an argument against God than against physicists.

167
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:14,810
雞胸還是雞腿
Light or dark?

168

我要請簡做我五月舞會[劍橋傳統]的舞伴
I'm inviting Jane to be my partner for the May ball.

170
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,990
真的嗎  真棒

171
00:14:24,990 --> 00:14:28,720
你要跳舞了  斯蒂芬
You'll have to dance, won't you, Stephen?

172
00:14:28,990 --> 00:14:31,970
給女僕讓個路  好了
Make way for my mother's maid, here we go.

173
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:50,560
你好
Hello.

174
00:14:53,340 --> 00:14:54,510
你好
Hello.

175
00:15:09,830 --> 00:15:12,660
-抱歉  -你沒事吧
- Sorry. - Are you okay?

176
00:15:21,390 --> 00:15:23,870
-跳舞吧  -不跳
- Should we dance? - No.

177
00:15:25,410 --> 00:15:26,870
不跳了
No.

178
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:29,770
我不跳  雖然我很喜歡看別人跳
I don't. It's a phenomenon I'm very happy to observe,

179
00:15:29,770 --> 00:15:32,090
但我自己是不會跳的
but I can't possibly imagine participating.

180
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:34,330
我也這麼想的  誰願意跳舞啊
I absolutely agree. I mean, who would want to dance?

181
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:36,490
說真的  我不跳舞
No, I'm serious, I don't dance.

182
00:15:39,430 --> 00:15:41,390
那就不跳了
No dancing then.

183
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:50,310
你看男生的襯衫前胸
Do you see how the men's shirt-fronts

184
00:15:50,330 --> 00:15:53,820
還有領結  比女生的禮服還閃亮
and their bow ties how they glow more than the womens' dresses?

185
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:56,800
-是啊  -知道為什麼嗎
- Yes. - Do you know why?

186
00:15:56,850 --> 00:15:59,840
-為什麼  -汰漬
- Why? - Tide.

187
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:01,540
洗衣粉
Washing powder.

188
00:16:01,630 --> 00:16:04,380
洗衣粉裡的螢光物質在紫外線照射下發光
The fluorescence in the washing powder is caught by the UV light.

189
00:16:06,490 --> 00:16:08,080
你怎麼知道的
Why do you know that?

190
00:16:13,690 --> 00:16:20,320
恒星誕生和毀滅時  會輻射出紫外線
When stars are born and when they die, they emit UV radiation.

191
00:16:20,870 --> 00:16:24,070
如果只能看到夜空裡的紫外線
So, if we could see the night sky in ultraviolet light,

192
00:16:24,090 --> 00:16:26,940
現在的星星就都不見了
then almost all the stars would disappear

193
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:33,640
只剩下恒星壯麗的誕生和毀滅
and all that we would see are these spectacular births and deaths.

194
00:16:35,930 --> 00:16:40,460
-我覺得應該...  -就像這個
- And I reckon it would look a little... - Like that.

195
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:18,390
-為什麼  -什麼為什麼
- So, why? - Why what?

196
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:20,860
為什麼要研究中世紀西班牙詩歌
Why Spanish medieval poetry?

197
00:17:20,860 --> 00:17:23,770
應該是我喜歡穿越時空吧...
I suppose I like to time travel...

198
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:26,210
...像你一樣
...like you.

199
00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:29,240
有哪段時空是你特別想去的嗎
Are there any particular time periods that you'd like to visit?

200
00:17:29,290 --> 00:17:32,860
-二十年代吧  -咆哮的二十年代嗎[1920  北美]
- The imagine it's the Twenties. - The Roaring Twenties?

201
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:41,730
耶茨  《The Song of the Happy Shepherd》

202
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:37,060
"不要在天文學家那找尋知識
"Seek, then, No learning from starry men,

203
00:17:37,060 --> 00:17:39,650
"他們只是用望遠鏡
"Who follow with the optic glass

204
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:41,730
"追隨恒星紛飛的路徑"
"The whirling ways of stars that pass."

205
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:48,280
真棒
Bravo!

206
00:18:20,790 --> 00:18:28,250
"創世之初  只有天地
"In the beginning was the heaven and the earth,

207
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:33,330
大地混沌  沒有定型"
and the earth was without form,"

208
00:18:34,290 --> 00:18:39,300
"黑暗籠罩著深淵"
"And darkness was upon the face of the deep."

209
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:54,480
和我共舞一曲吧
Would you dance with me?

210
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:55,110
三號月臺  前往倫敦國王十字車站的列車
The train now departing from track number three is

211
00:19:55,150 --> 00:20:00,350
將於九點十五發車
the nine-fifteen service to London King's Cross.

212
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:09,580
快點  斯蒂芬  快點
Come on, Stephen. Get a move on.

213
00:20:10,050 --> 00:20:13,320
怎麼了你  快上來
What's wrong with you, man? Come up top.

214
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:30,640
一顆恒星  體積是太陽的三倍多
A star, more than three times the size of our sun...

215
00:20:30,690 --> 00:20:35,010
就要走到盡頭  怎麼結束呢  坍落
ought to end its life, how? With a collapse.

216
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:39,220
整顆恒星的引力
The gravitational forces of the entire mass overcoming

217
00:20:39,270 --> 00:20:42,520
克服了原子之間的斥力
the electromagnetic forces of individual atoms,

218
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:44,320
向內坍落
and so collapsing inwards.

219
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:47,440
如果品質足夠大  還會繼續坍落
If the star is massive enough, it will continue this collapse,

220
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:51,240
形成一個黑洞  翹曲了時空
creating a black hole, where the warping of space-time

221
00:20:51,290 --> 00:20:55,080
什麼都逃不出去  包括光
is so great that nothing can escape... not even light.

222
00:20:55,130 --> 00:21:00,600
變得越來越小  越小
It gets... smaller... smaller.

223
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:05,230
恒星的密度越來越大
The star, in fact, gets denser

224
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:10,180
原子  甚至原子內的粒子都被壓縮了
as atoms, even subatomic particles get literally crushed into smaller and smaller space.

225
00:21:11,950 --> 00:21:16,400
那最終  我們得到了什麼
And at its end point what are we left with?

226
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:20,550
時空奇點
A space time singularity.

227
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:24,920
時空在這裡停止
Space and time come to a stop.

228
00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:53,970
我在想  如果把彭羅斯的理論
I wonder what would happen if you applied

229
00:21:53,970 --> 00:21:56,780
從黑洞推廣到整個宇宙呢
Penrose's theory about black holes to the entire universe?

230
00:21:57,940 --> 00:21:59,730
如果愛因斯坦是對的
If Einstein is right,

231
00:21:59,730 --> 00:22:02,750
或者說廣義相對論是對的  那宇宙是在膨脹的
or if general relativity is correct, then the universe is expanding, yes?

232
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:03,020
對吧
Yes?

233
00:22:03,070 --> 00:22:04,170
-對  -好了
- Yes. - Okay, so...

234
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:07,840
如果時光倒流  宇宙就是在縮小
If you reverse time, then the universe is getting smaller.

235
00:22:08,230 --> 00:22:10,350
-沒錯  -那麼
- All right. - So...

236
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:13,310
如果一路倒退回去
What if I reverse the process all the way

237
00:22:13,310 --> 00:22:17,420
回到時間的起點呢
back to see what happened at the beginning of Time itself?

238
00:22:17,850 --> 00:22:20,020
-時間的起點  -對
- The beginning of Time itself? - Yes.

239
00:22:20,180 --> 00:22:22,590
宇宙越來越小
The universe, getting smaller and smaller,

240
00:22:22,590 --> 00:22:25,450
密度越來越大  溫度越來越高
getting denser and denser, hotter and hotter as...

241
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:26,970
隨著時間的倒流
As you wind back the clock.

242
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:30,330
-沒錯  時光倒流  -時光倒流
- Exactly, you wind back the clock. - Wind back the clock.

243
00:22:30,580 --> 00:22:33,880
你是想讓時光倒流嗎[逆時針]
Is that what you're doing? You're winding back the clock.

244
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:35,450
沒錯
Exactly what I'm doing.

245
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:40,100
繼續轉  還有好久呢  繼續轉
Well, keep winding! You've got quite a way to go! Keep winding.

246
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:41,050
我怕摔倒
I don't want to fall down.

247
00:22:41,050 --> 00:22:42,260
你得回到時間的起點
Well, you've got to go back to the beginning of time.

248
00:22:42,310 --> 00:22:45,570
可有你轉的  接著轉  別停
You've got a long way to go, so, keep winding, keep winding!

249
00:22:46,540 --> 00:22:48,150
直到...
Until you get...

250
00:22:49,220 --> 00:22:49,840
奇點
A singularity.

251
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:51,250
時空奇點
A space-time singularity,

252
00:22:51,250 --> 00:22:53,870
宇宙源自黑洞的爆炸
so the universe born from a black hole exploding.

253
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:56,620
-繼續  -繼續什麼
- Keep going. - What do you mean, "Keep going", what...

254
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,150
宇宙起源之前嗎
before the universe began?

255
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:01,120
不是  繼續  用數學來解決
No, no, no, no! Keep going, develop the mathematics!

256
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:51,710
用力頂  用力頂
Push it as hard as you can! Push it, push it!

257
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:54,570
-用力  -我用力了
- As hard as you can. - I am pushing as hard as I can.

258
00:24:55,800 --> 00:25:04,350
怎麼...  一  二  一  二
What... I count 1... 1, 2... 1, 2...

259
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:06,720
好了
All right, all right.

260
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:09,800
無名指  第四個夾子
Fourth finger, fourth peg.

261
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:48,380
是運動神經元病
It's called motor neuron disease.

262
00:25:51,450 --> 00:25:53,280
神經元逐步失調
It's a progressive neurological disorder

263
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:58,940
導致控制肌肉運動的腦細胞受損
that destroys the cells in the brain that control essential muscle activity,

264
00:25:58,990 --> 00:25:59,510
比如
such as...

265
00:26:00,050 --> 00:26:06,660
講話  行走  呼吸  吞咽
Speaking, walking, breathing, swallowing

266
00:26:06,780 --> 00:26:11,420
控制肌肉運動的電信號收到了干擾
The signals that muscles must receive in order to move are disrupted.

267
00:26:12,620 --> 00:26:18,440
結果就是肌肉逐步萎縮
The result is... gradual muscle decay, wasting away.

268
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:23,020
最終  喪失
Eventually, the ability to

269
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:28,150
運動能力  徹底地
control voluntary movement is... lost... entirely.

270
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:36,750
平均壽命是發病後兩年
I'm afraid average life expectancy is two years.

271
00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:42,770
我也無能為力
There's nothing I can do for you.

272
00:26:45,180 --> 00:26:46,860
大腦呢
What about the brain?

273
00:26:48,750 --> 00:26:52,140
大腦不受影響  你的思想依然在
The brain isn't affected, you're thoughts won't change.

274
00:26:52,190 --> 00:26:55,900
就是
It's... just that...

275
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:02,030
到最後  沒人能知道你在想什麼了
Well, eventually, no one will know what they are.

276
00:27:04,420 --> 00:27:06,570
非常抱歉
I'm ever so sorry.

277
00:27:56,510 --> 00:27:59,860
歡迎收看本周的自然世界
Well, welcome to this week's episode of "The Natural World",

278
00:27:59,910 --> 00:28:03,900
這次  我們將一起探索劍橋一位傑出物理學家
where this week we explore the bizarre hibernation patterns

279
00:28:03,990 --> 00:28:06,640
他的冬眠規律
of the rare Cambridge Physicist,

280
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:09,860
就是盛裝的這位
seen here in his remarkable plumage..."

281
00:28:12,070 --> 00:28:15,840
怎麼樣  他們怎麼說的  你的手腕怎麼樣
So, how was it? What did they say, how's your wrist?

282
00:28:15,890 --> 00:28:17,940
我病了  布萊恩
I have a disease, Bri.

283
00:28:19,690 --> 00:28:22,900
是花柳病嗎  斯蒂芬
Is it venereal... Stephen?

284
00:28:25,340 --> 00:28:27,800
是運動神經元病
I have motor neuron disease.

285
00:28:29,790 --> 00:28:30,970
不好意思
Sorry, I don't...

286
00:28:31,020 --> 00:28:34,210
盧•葛雷克病  他是個棒球運動員
It's Lou Gehrig's disease, he's a baseball player.

287
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:37,560
不好意思  神經運動  棒球什麼的病
Sorry, I'm lagging behind in my pioneering research into

288
00:28:37,730 --> 00:28:41,670
我還沒深入研究過
skilled motor, baseball related diseases.

289
00:28:42,740 --> 00:28:47,390
-我還剩兩年  -什麼
- I have two years to live. - Sorry?

290
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:52,110
大聲說出來就不那麼怪了是吧
It does sound odd when you say it out loud, doesn't it?

291
00:28:55,340 --> 00:28:58,740
什麼意思  你幹什麼
Whatchya mean? What are you doing?

292
00:29:00,710 --> 00:29:02,190
他們  他們
What did... what did... what...

293
00:29:02,190 --> 00:29:04,490
他們怎麼說的  我剛沒仔細...
what did they say? Sorry, I... I don't really...

294
00:29:07,510 --> 00:29:08,760
走吧  布萊恩
Will you go, Brian?

295
00:29:08,810 --> 00:29:10,740
斯蒂芬  是我太蠢了
Stephen, I was just being a berk...

296
00:29:10,750 --> 00:29:12,510
我沒...我肯定...
I didn't... I'm so... I'll be...

297
00:29:14,980 --> 00:29:16,490
走吧
You go.

298
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:21,860
斯蒂芬  找你的電話  是個姑娘
Stephen, phone for you. It's a girl.

299
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:39,130
-回頭見  好的
- I'll see you soon. - Yes.

300
00:29:50,670 --> 00:29:52,330
她在等著呢
She's waiting.

301
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:03,040
斯蒂芬
Stephen?

302
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:54,290
-簡  -布萊恩
- Jane! - Brian.

303
00:30:54,410 --> 00:30:57,500
真抱歉  我
I'm sorry... I'm...

304
00:30:57,610 --> 00:30:59,460
你坐下吧
Why don't you sit down.

305
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:09,650
真抱歉  是斯蒂芬的事
I'm so sorry. It's about Stephen.

306
00:31:09,650 --> 00:31:12,910
他之前住院...
You know he was in hospital...

307
00:31:50,610 --> 00:31:52,900
有教育意義嗎
Something educational?

308
00:31:55,140 --> 00:31:56,380
非常有
Very.

309
00:31:58,030 --> 00:32:00,840
約翰跟瑪莎有外遇
John is having an affair with Martha,

310
00:32:00,910 --> 00:32:02,610
可瑪莎愛著阿蘭
but Martha is in love with Alan,

311
00:32:02,610 --> 00:32:05,810
不過阿蘭應該是同性戀
and I think that Alan is probably homosexual,

312
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:08,380
看他的毛衣  我呢  我在盡力
by the look of his jumper, so, well, I'm just trying

313
00:32:08,380 --> 00:32:12,080
計算他們幸福的可能性
to work out the mathematical probability of happiness.

314
00:32:13,470 --> 00:32:14,760
要算出來了嗎
Are you close?

315
00:32:14,810 --> 00:32:18,620
應該是零點幾  不過還差著遠呢
It's some integer of zero, but, no, I'm not quite there yet.

316
00:32:22,190 --> 00:32:25,310
-斯蒂芬  -他剛走
- Stephen. - You just missed him.

317
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:27,170
之前還在這
He was here earlier.

318
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:31,490
別這樣
Don't do this.

319
00:32:36,270 --> 00:32:37,780
走吧
Go!

320
00:32:42,570 --> 00:32:43,990
好吧
Okay.

321
00:32:45,540 --> 00:32:47,290
跟我玩個遊戲
Play a game with me.

322
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:50,010
快走
Go!

323
00:32:54,370 --> 00:32:57,420
你要是不站起來跟我打一場
If you don't get up and play a game with me...

324
00:32:58,140 --> 00:33:00,340
我就不回來了
I won't come back here again...

325
00:33:04,250 --> 00:33:06,550
永遠不來了
...ever.

326
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:20,740
來吧
Come on!

327
00:34:49,580 --> 00:34:51,700
你走吧
You can leave me now.

328
00:34:51,950 --> 00:34:53,490
你不想談談嗎
Are you going to talk about this or not?

329
00:34:53,540 --> 00:34:56,240
-快走不好嗎  -你想要我走嗎
- Will you please just go? - Is that what you want?

330
00:34:56,330 --> 00:34:58,100
是  我想要你走  走吧
Yes, it is what I want, so, please,

331
00:34:58,100 --> 00:35:00,530
你要是還在乎我  就走吧
if you care about me all, then, please, just go!

332
00:35:00,580 --> 00:35:02,790
-不行  -我只剩兩年了
- I can't. - I have two years to live.

333
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:04,940
-我還要工作  -我愛你
- I need to work. - I love you.

334
00:35:10,110 --> 00:35:13,970
你這  你得出了錯誤結論
You've... you've leapt to... that's a false conclusion...

335
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:16,430
我要和你在一起  有多就是多久
I want us to be together, for as long as we've got,

336
00:35:16,540 --> 00:35:17,920
時間不長的話
and if that's not very long then, well,

337
00:35:17,930 --> 00:35:20,260
也沒事  兩年也夠
that's just how it is... it'll have to do.

338
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:24,560
你不知道會怎麼樣  我的一切都受影響
You don't know what's coming. It'll affect everything.

339
00:35:41,340 --> 00:35:44,040
你眼鏡總是這麼髒
Your glasses are always dirty.

340
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:02,800
給你
There.

341
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:06,290
好多了吧
That's better, isn't it?

342
00:36:07,310 --> 00:36:08,470
嗯
Yes.

343
00:36:11,330 --> 00:36:13,510
是啊
Yes, it is.

344
00:36:20,060 --> 00:36:22,710
...在盒子邊緣
...the solutions to the Schrodinger

345
00:36:22,710 --> 00:36:27,400
薛定諤方程是無解的  所以...
equation must vanish at the boundary of the box, so we have...

346
00:36:29,260 --> 00:36:30,960
時間
Time!

347
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:34,260
你的課題是時間嗎
Time, that's your subject?

348
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:38,660
有具體方向嗎
Any aspect in particular?

349
00:36:38,730 --> 00:36:40,040
就是時間
Time.

350
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:44,320
請進  請進
Come in, come in.

351
00:36:54,050 --> 00:37:00,350
你應該不知道自己面對的是什麼  簡
I don't think you realize what lies ahead, Jane.

352
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:03,850
他的壽命非常短
His life is going to be very short.

353
00:37:04,830 --> 00:37:13,080
要小心  你是在和科學作對
So, be careful, the weight of science is against you.

354
00:37:13,860 --> 00:37:18,510
而且你沒有抗爭的機會
And this will not be a fight, Jane.

355
00:37:20,530 --> 00:37:24,900
我們都會被打敗
This is going to be a very heavy defeat...

356
00:37:28,260 --> 00:37:30,080
...所有人
...for all of us.

357
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:37,600
我知道你們都怎麼想
I know what you all think... that...

358
00:37:39,330 --> 00:37:43,480
覺得我不是很堅強
That I don't look a terribly strong person.

359
00:37:46,660 --> 00:37:48,760
可我愛他
But I love him.

360
00:37:50,530 --> 00:37:53,650
他也愛我
And he loves me.

361
00:37:55,860 --> 00:37:59,440
我們要一起抗爭...
We're going to fight this illness together...

362
00:38:03,350 --> 00:38:05,050
...大家一起
...all of us.

363
00:39:30,930 --> 00:39:32,710
祝你好運
Good luck.

364
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:35,880
-早上好  斯蒂芬  -早上好  雷夫
- Good morning, Stephen. - Good morning, Rev.

365
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:47,660
我知道  我知道
I know, I know...

366
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:49,830
-...方程要更優雅一點  -是啊
- ...got to be a little more elegant. - Yes, that's what...

367
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:51,570
我懂...
I understand...

368
00:39:55,730 --> 00:39:57,590
進來吧  斯蒂芬
Come in, Stephen.

369
00:40:05,330 --> 00:40:09,600
我知道  一開始都擔心這個
I know it's something we're all worried about initially.

370
00:40:09,660 --> 00:40:13,850
你保留了些意見...
You had some reservations about it...

371
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:18,090
等著瞧吧
Well, well, we'll see.

372
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:20,110
-歡迎  斯蒂芬  -早上好
- Welcome, Stephen. - Morning.

373
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:24,010
-請坐吧  -不用  謝謝
- Would you like to take a seat? - No, I'm fine, thank you.

374
00:40:24,060 --> 00:40:25,410
確定嗎
You're sure?

375
00:40:25,460 --> 00:40:28,500
好吧  總體來說
So, so you... in summary.

376
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:32,370
第一章  漏洞百出
As we know, chapter one, full of holes.

377
00:40:33,260 --> 00:40:35,130
缺乏數理支持
Lacks mathematical support.

378
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:39,590
-基普•索恩教授  -第二章  原創的
- Professor Thorne. - Chapter Two, now, really original.

379
00:40:39,630 --> 00:40:41,630
用了不少羅傑的觀點
Uses a lot of Roger's ideas.

380
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:44,010
至少你還支持我的觀點
Well, at least you run with them.

381
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:47,790
第三章  留了太多疑問
Chapter three, too many unanswered questions.

382
00:40:48,060 --> 00:40:48,980
沒錯
I agree.

383
00:40:49,030 --> 00:40:51,830
當然了  還有第四章
And then, of course, we have chapter four,

384
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:54,960
時間起點的黑洞
this black hole at the beginning of time.

385
00:40:55,030 --> 00:40:58,200
-時空奇點  -沒錯
- Space-time singularity? - Indeed.

386
00:40:58,250 --> 00:41:00,190
太棒了
It's brilliant!

387
00:41:00,890 --> 00:41:02,090
太棒了
Brilliant.

388
00:41:02,340 --> 00:41:03,620
棒極了
Superb!

389
00:41:03,870 --> 00:41:07,040
那麼只剩下一句話了  做得不錯
And therefore, all that remains to be said is: Well done!

390
00:41:07,460 --> 00:41:09,360
或者準確點說
Or perhaps, I should say, to be more precise:

391
00:41:09,410 --> 00:41:12,220
-做的不錯  博士  -漂亮  斯蒂芬
- Well done, Doctor! - Bravo, Stephen.

392
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:15,090
這理論真不錯
An extraordinary theory.

393
00:41:17,460 --> 00:41:19,280
謝謝
Thank you.

394
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:24,690
-然後呢  -證明它
- So what next? - Prove it.

395
00:41:25,300 --> 00:41:31,690
用一個方程證明  時間是有起點的
To prove, with a single equation, that time had a beginning.

396
00:41:34,660 --> 00:41:37,360
是不是很棒  教授
Wouldn't that be nice, Professor?

397
00:41:38,900 --> 00:41:44,630
一個簡單  優美的方程
With one simple elegant equation

398
00:41:46,330 --> 00:41:48,930
來解釋萬物
to explain everything?

399
00:41:49,210 --> 00:41:54,250
是啊  肯定很棒
Yes, it would. It would indeed.

400
00:42:13,820 --> 00:42:17,560
受人尊敬的  能力超群的

謝謝  簡
Thank you, Jane.

405
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:32,830
真神奇  他是第一個擔心自己努力不夠
It is astonishing that he's the first person

406
00:42:32,830 --> 00:42:35,250
還能拿到博士學位的人
to receive his doctorate fearing what little work he's be doing.

407
00:42:36,900 --> 00:42:39,110
努力是霍金最討厭的詞
"Work" Was the worst four-letter word for Stephen.

408
00:42:39,110 --> 00:42:39,550
甚至在牛津
Even at Oxford,

409
00:42:39,560 --> 00:42:44,660
他平均每天只學習一個小時  一個小時
especially, he averaged an hour, an HOUR a day he averaged.

410
00:42:39,560 --> 00:42:44,660
-就這樣  斯蒂芬就是...  -真是神奇  我一開始...
- And that it is. It's Stephen... - It's astonishing that...

411
00:42:49,660 --> 00:42:50,400
過去六個月
And how many of your

412
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:52,120
我幫你們回了多少信
letters have I covered in the last six months?

413
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:54,500
你們外出搞研究時候
When you've been doing research trips...

414
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,590
-多少  -四封

415
00:43:24,430 --> 00:43:29,400
-沒事吧  -沒事  我沒事
- Everything all right? - I'm good... I'm fine.

416
00:44:19,830 --> 00:44:21,100
你好啊  羅賓
Hi, Robin.

417
00:44:25,230 --> 00:44:27,100
我沒事
It's ok. I'm all right.

418
00:46:16,490 --> 00:46:19,980

謝謝
Thank you.

423
00:46:54,690 --> 00:46:57,700
你剛說什麼了
Sorry, did you say something?

424
00:47:00,320 --> 00:47:02,380
我說...
I said...

425
00:47:05,880 --> 00:47:07,270
什麼
Yes?

426

謝謝
Thank you.

看看你
Look at you!

428
00:48:12,150 --> 00:48:14,090
去吧  簡
Go, Jane.

429
00:48:14,790 --> 00:48:16,430
馬上回來
I'll be one second.

430
00:48:17,910 --> 00:48:21,510
露絲  寶貝
Luce, Baby.

431
00:48:33,240 --> 00:48:34,520
簡
Jane.

432
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:04,780
斯蒂芬
Stephen.

433
00:49:05,370 --> 00:49:06,930
親愛的
Dear?

434
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:11,430
我有了個想法
I've got an idea.

435
00:49:16,220 --> 00:49:18,770
我說我有了個想法
I said I've had an idea.

436
00:49:29,720 --> 00:49:31,060
-你好  -你好  鄧尼斯
- Hello. - Hi, Dennis.

437
00:49:31,150 --> 00:49:33,430
-你好  鄧尼斯  -你好
- Hello, Dennis. - Hi.

438
00:49:34,950 --> 00:49:37,150
好了  我愛你
Okay, I love you.

439
00:49:37,220 --> 00:49:39,740
他沒事的  他沒事的
He'll be fine, he'll be fine.

440
00:49:41,790 --> 00:49:43,570
-抱歉  沒關係
- Sorry. - No problem.

441
00:49:51,850 --> 00:49:56,060
...我們可以推斷
...allowing us to predict that

442
00:49:56,060 --> 00:50:02,650
有些粒子  是可以逃離黑洞的
some particles can in fact escape a black hole.

443
00:50:02,700 --> 00:50:08,140
黑洞  並不是那麼黑的
The black holes are not, in fact, black at all,

444
00:50:09,070 --> 00:50:14,130
它散發著熱輻射
but glow with heat radiation.

445
00:50:16,250 --> 00:50:18,910
...也就是說
...the steady emission of

446
00:50:18,910 --> 00:50:24,010
黑洞在穩定地輻射熱能  損失品質
heat energy causes the black holes to lose mass,

447
00:50:25,620 --> 00:50:32,710
最終以爆炸的方式消失
and eventually they disappear in a spectacular explosion.

448
00:50:32,790 --> 00:50:35,500
非常  非常簡單  物體散發熱量
It's very, very simple, when a hot body loses heat...

449
00:50:35,550 --> 00:50:37,320
熱力學第二定理
Second law of thermodynamics.

450
00:50:37,370 --> 00:50:39,270
-沒錯  熱力學  -就在...
- He's right, it's thermodynamics. - In... in...

451
00:50:40,350 --> 00:50:42,620
想像一下  如果的確
If we can imagine that the black hole is, indeed,

452
00:50:42,630 --> 00:50:43,980
有粒子不斷逃離黑洞
losing particles, then,

453
00:50:43,980 --> 00:50:46,350
那假以時日  黑洞的體積就會減小  會蒸發
over time it will diminish in size, it will evaporate.

454
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:49,240
-然後  -消失
- It will... - Disappear.

455
00:50:51,520 --> 00:50:53,110
所以
So...

456
00:50:56,890 --> 00:51:03,900
首先  恒星消失  坍落成黑洞
First a star vanishes into a black hole,

457
00:51:04,990 --> 00:51:12,450
然後  黑洞也要...
but then the black hole itself must...

458
00:51:13,670 --> 00:51:14,890
消失  虛無
Gone! Nothing!

459
00:51:14,950 --> 00:51:18,520
-從虛無到虛無  -你欠我杯啤酒
- From nothing to nothing. - You owe me another beer.

460
00:51:19,090 --> 00:51:20,750
我得告訴你
I have to show you that our

461
00:51:20,750 --> 00:51:23,960
我們的朋友證明了時間是有起點的
friend has proven that time, indeed has a beginning.

462
00:51:24,150 --> 00:51:27,990
不僅是這個  還有宇宙如何出現  如何消亡
Not only that, how the universe was born, and how it will end.

463
00:51:28,170 --> 00:51:32,550
-砰  -哢嚓
- Bang! - Crunch!

464
00:51:34,380 --> 00:51:37,390
多美  多生動
It's beautiful! It's racy!

465
00:51:37,450 --> 00:51:41,410
真荒唐  胡言亂語
Complete nonsense. It's preposterous.

466
00:51:43,720 --> 00:51:46,940
是因為我說的東西嗎  教授
Was it something I said, Professor?

467
00:51:49,150 --> 00:51:50,890
抱歉
Excuse me.

468
00:51:52,690 --> 00:51:53,600
我叫
My name...

469
00:51:54,190 --> 00:51:56,820
我是卡拉提諾夫教授
My name is Professor Khalatnikov.

470
00:51:56,850 --> 00:51:59,040
來自蘇維埃理工學院
from Soviet Academy of Sciences.

471
00:51:59,150 --> 00:52:04,090
我的研究領域  是熱宇宙的演化
As you know, my field is evolution of the hot universe,

472
00:52:04,150 --> 00:52:07,930
宇宙微波背景輻射的性質
the properties of the microwave background radiation,

473
00:52:07,980 --> 00:52:10,540
還有黑洞理論
and theory of the black holes.

474
00:52:10,790 --> 00:52:13,150
說實話...
To be honest...

475
00:52:13,190 --> 00:52:14,840
我今天來...
I came here today...

476
00:52:15,890 --> 00:52:19,540
...就是想聽胡言亂語的
...expecting to hear a lot of nonsense.

477
00:52:20,390 --> 00:52:22,290
然後失望地回家
I go home disappointed.

478
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:27,910
這位小夥子做到了
The little one here... has done it.

479
00:52:28,760 --> 00:52:30,190
他做到了
He has done it!

480
00:52:38,020 --> 00:52:41,080
見到你真榮幸
It has been a pleasure to meet you,

481
00:52:41,080 --> 00:52:43,730
-教授  -彼此彼此

482
00:52:48,890 --> 00:52:53,950
-還算順利嘛  -是挺順利的
- That went pretty well. - It's probably for awhile.

483
00:52:57,750 --> 00:53:01,270
霍金輻射  這位小夥子做到了
Hawking radiation! The little one has done it!

484
00:53:01,270 --> 00:53:03,350
這位小夥子做到了
The little one has done it!

485
00:53:04,820 --> 00:53:07,250
-快點  天才  -真好笑
- Come on, Genius! - Oh, very funny!

486
00:53:10,390 --> 00:53:12,220
就推你到這了  老頭子
You've had enough of that, Old Man.

487
00:53:12,270 --> 00:53:17,170
用力  小子  1  2  3
Come on, codger. 1, 2, 3...

488
00:53:19,520 --> 00:53:21,440
天哪  簡是怎麼做到的
God! How does Jane manage?

489
00:53:25,520 --> 00:53:30,080
斯蒂芬  你那個運動口腔什麼的病  會不會影響...
Stephen, your Motor "Mouth" Disease, does it effect...

490
00:53:30,860 --> 00:53:31,970
什麼
What?

491
00:53:32,780 --> 00:53:34,360
一切
Everything?

492
00:53:36,810 --> 00:53:41,110
另一套系統  自動的
Different system... automatic.

493
00:53:41,210 --> 00:53:42,940
真的嗎
You serious?

494
00:53:42,990 --> 00:53:45,170
那還算不錯嘛
Well, that's a bit wonderful, isn't it?

495
00:53:45,980 --> 00:53:48,660
對男人的理解又進了一步
Well, it certainly explains a lot about men.

496
00:53:50,230 --> 00:53:54,300
快點
Hurry up! Come on!

497
00:54:15,180 --> 00:54:17,840
霍金輻射

498
00:54:27,180 --> 00:54:31,840
-裡面有什麼  -驚喜
- What's in there? - It's a surprise!

499
00:54:34,780 --> 00:54:36,410
別睜開
Keep them closed.

500
00:54:39,540 --> 00:54:40,410
爸爸  快看
Look, Daddy, look!

501

不喜歡的話可以退回去
If you don't like it, we can take it back.

503
00:55:09,580 --> 00:55:11,230
我不明白...
I don't understand...

504
00:55:11,230 --> 00:55:15,160
你花了好多年假設黑洞存在
you've spent years assuming black holes exist, and

505
00:55:15,180 --> 00:55:18,410
你相信天鵝座X-1星很可能
you believe Cygnus X-1 could well turn out to be

506
00:55:18,460 --> 00:55:21,890
是我們能觀測到的第一個黑洞
the first black hole that we can actually observe,

507
00:55:21,940 --> 00:55:24,310
卻還跟基普•索恩賭它不是
and yet you bet Kip Thorne it's not a black hole?

508
00:55:24,360 --> 00:55:26,490
-是的  -賭什麼
- Yes. - What did you bet him?

賭一年的雜誌
A one year's subscription to a magazine.

510

-什麼雜誌  《自然》嗎  -不是  《閣樓》
- Which magazine? Nature? - No! Penthouse!

511
00:55:36,680 --> 00:55:39,140
-《閣樓》嗎  -沒錯

等上去了就方便多了  你好啊  斯蒂芬
And once we're up at the top, it's very snug... hello, Stephen.

525
00:56:39,540 --> 00:56:41,040
好了
Here we go.

526
00:56:41,090 --> 00:56:43,280
-來給你轉個身  -要我推一下嗎
- We'll turn you around, Stephen. - You want me to push?

527
00:56:43,480 --> 00:56:46,040
不用  我沒事  你去拿行李吧
No, no, I'll be fine, you get the luggage.

528
00:56:46,110 --> 00:56:48,220

535
00:57:28,040 --> 00:57:29,840
出來了嗎
Is it out?

536
00:57:31,240 --> 00:57:33,950
-要點水嗎  -不用  沒事
- Some... some water? - No, don't worry.

537
00:57:34,690 --> 00:57:36,860
好了  沒事了
You're okay. That's it.

538
00:57:37,180 --> 00:57:40,800
沒事了  沒事了
There we go. It's okay. It's okay.

539
00:57:40,810 --> 00:57:42,720
得去看醫生
He needs to see a specialist.

540
00:57:42,720 --> 00:57:45,290
老是這樣
It keeps happening over and over again.

541
00:57:45,940 --> 00:57:54,280
-不看醫生  不看醫生  -好  不看
- No doctors. No doctors! - All right, no doctors.

542
00:57:58,730 --> 00:58:00,630
來點水
A little water.

543
00:58:38,810 --> 00:58:40,560
斯蒂芬
Stephen?

544
00:58:43,410 --> 00:58:45,120
我需要幫手
I need help.

545
00:58:47,710 --> 00:58:52,290
為了羅伯特  他的童年都被我拖累了
If only for Robert, it... he's missing out on his childhood.

546
00:58:52,580 --> 00:58:55,930
我想努力把這個家經營下去
I keep looking for a way to make this work,

547
00:58:55,930 --> 00:58:58,260
可我一個人做不到
but I can't find it on my own.

548
00:58:58,310 --> 00:59:03,250
沒問題啊  我們是個正常的家庭
Everything is fine, we're just a normal family.

549
00:59:03,280 --> 00:59:06,080
哪裡正常了
We're not a normal family.

550
00:59:09,880 --> 00:59:12,030
哪裡正常了
We're not a normal family!

551
00:59:15,110 --> 00:59:21,930
羅伯特  你媽媽對我非常生氣
Robert, your mother is very angry with me.

552
00:59:28,680 --> 00:59:30,570
謝謝啊
Thanks.

553
00:59:40,290 --> 00:59:41,710
簡
Jane?

554
00:59:47,620 --> 00:59:49,410
簡  停下
Jane! Stop!

555
00:59:56,770 --> 00:59:58,150
坐下
Sit!

556
01:00:11,920 --> 01:00:13,650
好了...
Now...

557
01:00:15,740 --> 01:00:18,140
我給你提個建議
I'd like to make a suggestion.

558
01:00:21,040 --> 01:00:25,240
聽著有點奇怪  可也幫過大忙
It might sound unusual, but I have seen it work wonders.

559
01:00:25,380 --> 01:00:31,250
我覺得你應該加入唱詩班
I think that you should consider joining the church choir.

560
01:00:36,680 --> 01:00:38,410
媽媽
Mum...

561
01:00:38,480 --> 01:00:39,940
我好久都沒聽過
I think that's possibly

562
01:00:39,940 --> 01:00:42,750
這麼貼心的話了
the most English thing anyone has ever said.

563
01:00:44,840 --> 01:00:46,480
也許吧
Maybe so.

564
01:00:48,510 --> 01:00:51,690
-我以前喜歡唱歌  -唱得挺好的
- I used to love singing. - You're very good at it.

565
01:00:52,240 --> 01:00:55,280
-可我也不確定  -去吧
- I don't know about that. - Just go.

566
01:00:58,010 --> 01:01:00,280
每週一小時
It's one hour a week.

567
01:01:43,840 --> 01:01:46,940
真棒  大夥下周見
Really lovely, everyone. Okay, see you next week.

568
01:01:59,080 --> 01:02:00,260
-你好  -你好
- Hello. - Hello.

569
01:02:00,340 --> 01:02:05,780
-是要加入唱詩班嗎  -我是來...
- Have you come to sing? - Um... I just came to...

570
01:02:08,800 --> 01:02:11,140
-高音嗎  -中音
- Soprano? - Mezzo.

571
01:02:11,200 --> 01:02:13,660
太棒了  正需要中音
Ah! Lovely! Just what we need.

572
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:16,990
-你早去哪了  -問得好
- Where have you been hiding? - A good question.

573
01:02:17,030 --> 01:02:20,260
反正來得早不如來得巧
Well, you're here now and just in time.

574
01:02:20,270 --> 01:02:22,010
俗話說的
As they say.

575
01:02:27,170 --> 01:02:30,070
-反正我還要回來的  -好
- Ya know, I have to come back anyway. - Great.

576
01:02:30,130 --> 01:02:32,430
-都給你了嗎  -是的  謝謝
- Do you have everything? - Yes, thank you, yes.

577
01:02:32,480 --> 01:02:36,910
謝謝你  你肯定是...團裡的中流砥柱
Thank you for coming, you will be a... A valuable asset.

578
01:02:37,030 --> 01:02:38,760
謝謝
Thank you.

579
01:02:41,700 --> 01:02:43,570
我  我該走了
Well, I should... I should be going.

580
01:02:43,670 --> 01:02:46,540
要是你兒子想學鋼琴...
And... uh... if your son wants those piano lessons, just...

581
01:02:46,630 --> 01:02:48,930
是啊  沒問題
Yes, yes, absolutely, I... um...

582
01:02:49,520 --> 01:02:50,700
-肯定找你  -真棒
- I will do. - Great.

583
01:02:50,730 --> 01:02:53,930
我丈夫也喜歡音樂
My... my husband... adores music, too.

584
01:02:53,930 --> 01:02:56,670
他彈什麼樂器嗎
Oh! Well! Does he play?

585
01:02:58,020 --> 01:03:00,340
我也可以教他的
I could... I could teach him as well.

586
01:03:01,030 --> 01:03:04,220
說來話長  不過...
That's a long story. But, um...

587
01:03:04,270 --> 01:03:05,430
好吧
Ah, okay.

588
01:03:05,700 --> 01:03:08,210
-謝謝你  喬納森  -不客氣  簡  再見
- Well, thank you, Jonathan - My pleasure, Jane, see you again.

589
01:03:08,260 --> 01:03:09,730
-再見  -再見
- Bye bye. - Bye bye.

590
01:04:02,930 --> 01:04:04,480
要酒嗎
Wine?

591
01:04:05,470 --> 01:04:07,210
好啊  謝謝
Why not, thank you.

592
01:04:07,260 --> 01:04:09,810
-斯蒂芬  -要
- Stephen? - Yes.

593
01:04:27,770 --> 01:04:31,420
斯蒂芬  簡跟我說  你有個優美的理論
Stephen, Jane was telling me you have a beautiful theorem...

594
01:04:33,570 --> 01:04:38,840
證明宇宙是有開端的
...that... that proves the universe had a beginning?

595
01:04:42,900 --> 01:04:46,740
我的博士論文
That was my PhD thesis.

596
01:04:49,130 --> 01:04:52,900
我的新課題證明那是錯的
My new project disproves it.

597
01:04:53,900 --> 01:04:55,060
是錯的
Disproves it?

598
01:04:55,110 --> 01:04:56,480
是錯的
Yes.

599
01:04:58,700 --> 01:05:01,720
那你不再相信創世理論了
So, then, you no longer believe in the Creation?

600
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:08,260
在物理學裡  人信仰什麼是...
What one believes is irrelevant...

601
01:05:08,400 --> 01:05:11,080
...是不重要的
...irrelevant in physics.

602
01:05:12,650 --> 01:05:14,120
好吧
I see.

603
01:05:14,630 --> 01:05:16,200
斯蒂芬來了個大轉彎
Stephen's done a U-turn.

604
01:05:16,300 --> 01:05:20,020
新的理論是宇宙沒有邊界
The big new idea is that the universe has no boundaries at all.

605
01:05:20,570 --> 01:05:22,560
沒有邊界  沒有開端...
No boundaries, no beginning...

606
01:05:22,570 --> 01:05:25,850
...也沒有上帝
...and no God. Oh!

607
01:05:25,900 --> 01:05:29,050
明白了  我還以為
Oh, I see... I... I thought that...

608
01:05:29,370 --> 01:05:30,570
你證明宇宙有開端
you'd proved the universe

609
01:05:30,570 --> 01:05:32,770
進一步證明有創世主
had a beginning and thus a need for a Creator.

610
01:05:34,900 --> 01:05:39,060
-我的錯  -是我的
- My mistake. - No... mine.

611
01:05:41,300 --> 01:05:43,080
斯蒂芬想找到一個理論
Stephen is looking for a single theory

612
01:05:43,090 --> 01:05:46,080
來解釋宇宙中的一切
that explains all the forces in the universe.

613
01:05:47,190 --> 01:05:49,270
這樣上帝就必須死
Therefore, God must die.

614
01:05:49,370 --> 01:05:51,980
為什麼上帝必須死  我不明白
Why must God die, I don't see.

615
01:05:52,570 --> 01:05:58,190
物理學的兩大支柱是  量子論
The two great pillars of physics are: Quantum Theory,

616
01:05:58,430 --> 01:06:02,230
針對所有微小粒子的理論
the laws that govern the very small particles,

617
01:06:02,240 --> 01:06:05,870
電子什麼的  還有廣義相對論
electrons and so on, and General Relativity.

618
01:06:05,970 --> 01:06:07,320
對  愛因斯坦
Ah, yes, Einstein.

619
01:06:07,370 --> 01:06:09,410
愛因斯坦的理論  針對非常巨大的
Einstein's theory, the law that governs the very large,

620
01:06:09,460 --> 01:06:14,100
恒星什麼的  但量子論  和相對論
planets and such, but Quantum, and Relativity...

621
01:06:14,170 --> 01:06:16,190
別說  他們是不一樣的
Don't tell me... they're different?

622
01:06:16,440 --> 01:06:19,180
一點也不一樣
They don't remotely play by the same rules.

623
01:06:19,870 --> 01:06:23,830
如果宇宙裡只有土豆  那很簡單
If the world were all potatoes, then, easy

624
01:06:23,900 --> 01:06:28,410
我們可以追溯回去  像斯蒂芬之前一樣
you could trace a precise beginning, as Stephen once did,

625
01:06:28,620 --> 01:06:30,790
找到創世的那一刻
a moment of Creation.

626
01:06:31,350 --> 01:06:34,780
哈利路亞  上帝是存在的
Hallelujah, God lives.

627
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:36,870
可是有了豌豆之後
If you incorporate peas into the menu,

628
01:06:36,870 --> 01:06:38,250
就變得有點...
then it all goes a little...

629
01:06:38,400 --> 01:06:40,090
...亂搞了
...tits up.

630
01:06:40,570 --> 01:06:43,000
沒錯  瘋掉了
Yes, haywire.

631
01:06:43,070 --> 01:06:45,410
-變成了沒有上帝的亂世  -天啊
- It all becomes a Godless mess. - Oh, dear.

632
01:06:45,600 --> 01:06:48,000
愛因斯坦討厭豌豆
Einstein hated peas.

633
01:06:48,630 --> 01:06:50,420
也就是量子論  他說
Quantum Theory, he said,

634
01:06:50,420 --> 01:06:53,560
"上帝不擲骰子"
"God doesn't play dice with the universe."

635
01:06:53,630 --> 01:06:57,840
可是他不僅玩骰子
Seems he not only plays the dice,

636
01:06:57,960 --> 01:07:03,000
還扔到了我們看不到的地方
but he throws them where we can't find them.

637
01:07:03,050 --> 01:07:05,380
上帝又變成了珍稀物種
God is back on the endangered species list.

638
01:07:06,880 --> 01:07:09,270
他應該能適應的
Well, I expect He'll cope.

639
01:07:09,320 --> 01:07:13,360
物理學又登場了
But physics is back in business.

640
01:07:13,450 --> 01:07:18,820
對  物理學又登場了
Yes, physics is back in business.

641
01:07:30,030 --> 01:07:32,360
我以前結過婚
I was married... actually.

642
01:07:34,870 --> 01:07:37,220
可她突然去世了
But suddenly... she passed.

643
01:07:38,600 --> 01:07:40,490
差不多一年了
Almost a year ago now.

644
01:07:42,830 --> 01:07:44,930
白血病
It was leukemia.

645
01:07:47,270 --> 01:07:52,860
她抗爭過  我也盡力照顧  可還是...
She fought it and I nursed her, but in the end...

646
01:07:58,300 --> 01:08:04,870
我特別孤獨  獨守空房
I do get quite lonely... the tyranny of the empty room.

647
01:08:04,930 --> 01:08:06,660
什麼的
And all that.

648
01:08:07,470 --> 01:08:11,200
但音樂拯救了我  在唱詩班  教人彈琴
But... music is my salvation... teaching and playing.

649
01:08:11,370 --> 01:08:13,230
算不上職業吧
Not really as a career,

650
01:08:13,230 --> 01:08:15,290
反正我也沒有什麼野心
but I... I'm not that ambitious, so...

651
01:08:22,030 --> 01:08:25,220
這算不算是罪  我也不知道
Is that a sin? I don't know.

652
01:08:26,570 --> 01:08:29,480
問錯人了
Wrong man to ask.

653
01:08:34,770 --> 01:08:37,670
-謝謝你們的招待  -謝謝你能來
- Thank you so much for having me. - Thank you for coming.

654
01:08:37,720 --> 01:08:40,230
真是太...太好了
It was re... really... really wonderful.

655
01:08:40,330 --> 01:08:44,150
如果有什麼能幫你的
If there's anything I can do to be of service... to you.

656
01:08:44,200 --> 01:08:47,000
我是說幫你們家
To the family, I mean.

657
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:48,510
不要客氣
I would... consider it a privilege.

658
01:08:48,700 --> 01:08:52,730
我沒有孩子  單身也沒什麼負擔
I have no children, or commitments.

659
01:08:52,770 --> 01:08:55,980
我沒別的意思  就是想幫你  我...
I only mean that if I... could be of help, I've...

660
01:08:56,030 --> 01:08:58,130
我肯定...  也算是
I'm... really, if I might find a purpose

661
01:08:58,130 --> 01:09:02,410
幫我排解孤獨了
that would help alleviate my own situation.

662
01:09:04,110 --> 01:09:06,590
-晚安  -晚安
- Good night. - Night.

663
01:09:42,830 --> 01:09:46,060
我理解你的
I understand...

664
01:09:47,670 --> 01:09:50,940
如果你需要幫助...
If you need help...

665
01:09:53,230 --> 01:09:59,490
並且有人願意幫忙
If someone is prepared to offer...

666
01:10:02,990 --> 01:10:06,640
我不會反對的
I won't object.

667
01:12:30,490 --> 01:12:33,860
您是一人   也是萬物
Calls you one and calls you all,

668
01:12:33,920 --> 01:12:36,920
他的領域  永存於世
to gain his everlasting hall.

669
01:12:37,420 --> 01:12:43,840
生為救贖  解救眾生
Christ was born to save. Christ was born to save.

670
01:12:43,920 --> 01:12:46,070
太棒了  大家可以走了
Great! Lovely! Okay! We can go!

671
01:12:47,390 --> 01:12:49,850

I'm... could... could you all leave a copy of that?

673
01:12:59,690 --> 01:13:01,180
我有話要跟你說
There's something I need to tell you.

674
01:13:01,980 --> 01:13:03,400
什麼
What?

675
01:13:04,020 --> 01:13:05,490
我懷孕了
I'm pregnant.

676
01:13:08,260 --> 01:13:11,910
天啊  我...我還以為你和斯蒂芬
Gosh! I... I, um... I assumed that you and Stephen...

677
01:13:13,020 --> 01:13:15,510
真...真是太棒了
Well, that's... that's really wonderful.

678
01:13:15,930 --> 01:13:18,730
-確實  -真的  太美妙了
- It is. - Yes, it's wonderful.

679
01:13:19,660 --> 01:13:23,510
-簡  恭喜你  -謝謝
- Congratulations, Jane. - Thank you.

680
01:13:38,910 --> 01:13:40,530
說"茄子"  準備好了嗎
Everyone say "Cheese"! Ready?

681
01:13:40,540 --> 01:13:42,560
我數到三  1  2  3
Count 3! 1, 2, 3...

682
01:13:42,610 --> 01:13:44,340
茄子
Cheese!

683
01:13:57,120 --> 01:13:59,520
-媽媽  -來了
- Mummy! - Just coming.

684
01:14:08,860 --> 01:14:11,160
那個
Now, you know...

685
01:14:11,190 --> 01:14:13,090
我一直都很支持你
I've always been supportive

686
01:14:13,090 --> 01:14:15,970
不請人來幫忙
of your choice not to have home help,

687
01:14:16,020 --> 01:14:18,240
但我們得想個長遠的辦法
but we need to find a permanent solution.

688
01:14:18,240 --> 01:14:19,660
這種...這種...
This... this...

689
01:14:20,020 --> 01:14:22,300
這種狀況不是長久之計
situation cannot continue,

690
01:14:22,300 --> 01:14:26,860
你得趕緊找個常住的護工
you need to have a proper live-in nurse immediately.

691
01:14:27,160 --> 01:14:29,220
有人照顧我
We have help.

692
01:14:29,560 --> 01:14:33,360
你知道我什麼意思
Look... you know what I'm talking about.

693
01:14:33,560 --> 01:14:36,840
我們雇不起護工
We can't afford a live-in nurse.

694
01:14:36,850 --> 01:14:39,160
斯蒂芬  這樣不是辦法
Stephen, you need to find a way,

695
01:14:39,160 --> 01:14:40,740
為了你的家人
for your family's sake...

696
01:14:40,740 --> 01:14:42,480
你已經是世界名人了
you're world famous.

697
01:14:42,530 --> 01:14:46,910
我是因為黑洞出名的  又不是搖滾樂
For black holes, not for rock concerts.

698
01:14:47,580 --> 01:14:53,090
斯蒂芬  我沒開玩笑  這事不能拖
Stephen, this isn't funny, I believe it's urgent.

699
01:15:13,360 --> 01:15:15,520
我們有權知道真相
We do have a right to know.

700
01:15:15,590 --> 01:15:18,140
簡  我們有權知道
We have a right to know, Jane.

701
01:15:21,060 --> 01:15:23,100
知道什麼
Know what?

702
01:15:23,690 --> 01:15:26,080
蒂莫西的爸爸是誰...
Whose child Timothy is...

703
01:15:26,080 --> 01:15:29,060
斯蒂芬還是喬納森
Stephen's, or Jonathan's?

704
01:15:31,290 --> 01:15:33,820
我在你們眼裡就是那樣的人
That's what you think of me?

705
01:15:34,720 --> 01:15:36,160
除了斯蒂芬
There is no way that Timothy

706
01:15:36,160 --> 01:15:38,280
沒人可能是蒂莫西的爸爸
could have any other father than Stephen.

707
01:15:38,660 --> 01:15:40,460
行了吧
Enough!

708
01:15:50,910 --> 01:15:53,770
-喬納森  別走  -我該走了
- Jonathan, please don't go. - I have to go.

709
01:15:54,060 --> 01:15:56,770
-所有人都說我們...  -那又怎樣
- Everybody's talking, and... - So, what does it matter?

710
01:15:56,820 --> 01:15:58,890
我很難做下去  我只是想幫你們
It's difficult for me because I'm just trying to help.

711
01:15:58,940 --> 01:15:59,580
我當然知道
I know you're trying to help

712
01:15:59,580 --> 01:16:01,500
而且你幫了很大忙
and your help is valueless.

713
01:16:01,520 --> 01:16:02,800
我想現在我最好還是
The best thing for me right thing right now,

714
01:16:02,800 --> 01:16:03,740
還是...還是
I think, maybe if... if... if...

715
01:16:04,150 --> 01:16:06,140
...退出你們的生活吧
...I just step back for now.

716
01:16:06,160 --> 01:16:07,460
喬納森  別這樣
Please, Jonathan,

717
01:16:07,460 --> 01:16:08,870
我們需要你  孩子需要你
we need you, the children need you,

718
01:16:08,870 --> 01:16:10,810
我需要你  斯蒂芬也需要你
and I need you, and Stephen needs you.

719
01:16:10,860 --> 01:16:11,660
-喬納森  -別說這些了
- Jonathan... - Don't think of it.

720
01:16:11,690 --> 01:16:14,180
但是  簡  還有別的原因
But there's other things as well. Jane, I...

721
01:16:17,020 --> 01:16:18,950
我對你有感覺
I have feelings for you.

722
01:16:23,360 --> 01:16:26,110
我對你也是
And I have feelings for you, too.

723
01:16:31,060 --> 01:16:32,900
簡  謝謝你
Thank you, Jane.

724
01:17:21,510 --> 01:17:26,000
有人邀我去波爾多
I've been invited to Bordeaux.

725
01:17:26,420 --> 01:17:30,720
-去哪  -波爾多
- Invited where? - To Bordeaux.

726
01:17:31,850 --> 01:17:33,500
你要去波爾多
To Bordeaux?

727
01:17:34,680 --> 01:17:36,180
馬克他們嗎
Mark and them?

728
01:17:36,820 --> 01:17:39,710
學生們可以帶我去
Students can take me,

729
01:17:39,710 --> 01:17:43,240
我知道你不喜歡坐飛機
I know you hate flying.

730
01:17:43,740 --> 01:17:45,930
我確實討厭坐飛機
I do hate to fly.

731
01:17:46,270 --> 01:17:52,340
你開車去吧  我們波爾多見
Bring the car, meet me in Bordeaux.

732
01:17:53,920 --> 01:17:58,090
這樣孩子們也舒服些
Make the children comfy.

733
01:17:59,970 --> 01:18:02,300
斯蒂芬  你一個人去太不方便了
It'd be too difficult to manage, Stephen.

734
01:18:08,970 --> 01:18:13,400
讓喬納森陪你吧
Bring Jonathan.

735
01:18:17,420 --> 01:18:20,270
他不一定願意去吧
I doubt he would be willing.

736
01:18:37,160 --> 01:18:38,590
你好啊  斯蒂芬
Hello, Stephen.

737
01:18:55,060 --> 01:18:58,010
-喝這個行嗎  -這個...
- Is this okay? - Well...

738
01:18:59,190 --> 01:19:01,160
我是不會說出去的
I won't tell if you won't.

739
01:19:12,370 --> 01:19:13,490
但是...
Just...

740
01:19:14,360 --> 01:19:16,880
別喝多  你還得開車呢
bearing in mind you have to drive.

741
01:19:32,380 --> 01:19:35,130
簡需要你的説明
Jane needs help.

742
01:19:49,460 --> 01:19:50,800
薩拉  千萬記得
Sarah, you won't forget to give him

743
01:19:50,800 --> 01:19:52,790
一著陸就給他注射藥物
the injection as soon as soon as you land, will you.

744
01:19:52,840 --> 01:19:54,050
到賓館記得給我打個電話
And you'll call me when you get to the hotel.

745
01:19:54,080 --> 01:19:55,320

747
01:19:57,480 --> 01:19:59,080
斯蒂芬
Stephen?

748
01:20:01,350 --> 01:20:03,320
媽媽帶孩子去
Mum'll take the baby.

749
01:20:03,950 --> 01:20:07,040
-她一會就到  -我們波爾多見

01:20:33,550 --> 01:20:36,240
-他們睡了嗎  -睡了
- They asleep? - Yeah.

752
01:22:37,190 --> 01:22:38,780
喬納森
Jonathan.

753
01:23:51,990 --> 01:23:53,220
喬納森
Jonathan?

754
01:23:53,810 --> 01:23:57,610
喬納森  斯蒂芬出事了
Jonathan, it's Stephen, he's been just taken ill,

755
01:23:57,710 --> 01:24:00,120
他突然病重  被送到了醫院
he's in the hospital right now,

756
01:24:00,130 --> 01:24:01,430
現在還在昏迷
he's in a coma.

757
01:24:33,430 --> 01:24:34,430
他怎麼了

758
01:24:36,430 --> 01:24:37,430
他感染了重度肺炎

759
01:24:39,430 --> 01:24:41,430
現在全靠呼吸機維持

760
01:24:45,430 --> 01:24:46,430
不知道他還能撐多久

761
01:24:50,430 --> 01:24:51,430
我得問問我的同事

762
01:24:51,430 --> 01:24:53,430
能不能撤掉呼吸機

763
01:24:56,410 --> 01:24:58,420
你什麼意思
What are you talking about?

764
01:25:01,650 --> 01:25:03,730
可以讓他沒有痛苦的離開
This way would be a painless end.

765
01:25:03,780 --> 01:25:05,920
讓他脫離麻醉狀態
If we try to bring him round from the anesthetic

766
01:25:05,920 --> 01:25:09,100
也不一定能保他的命
it's not sure he will survive resuscitation.

767
01:25:10,580 --> 01:25:12,940
讓他脫離麻醉狀態
You have to bring him round from the anesthetic!

768
01:25:14,400 --> 01:25:16,790
你確定真要這麼做
Are you sure it's what you want?

769
01:25:17,840 --> 01:25:20,940
讓他呼吸的唯一方法
The only way of weaning him off the ventilator

770
01:25:20,940 --> 01:25:23,110
就是實施氣管切開手術
would be to give him a tracheotomy,

771
01:25:23,280 --> 01:25:27,330
在脖子上開刀  從喉嚨旁邊過去
a hole in the neck, by-passing the throat.

772
01:25:28,510 --> 01:25:30,770
他就再也沒法說話了
He will never speak again.

773
01:25:35,110 --> 01:25:39,850
沒得商量  必須要保住他的命
There's no question... Stephen must live.

774
01:25:39,900 --> 01:25:43,230
需要什麼就用什麼
I will see he gets everything he needs.

775
01:25:43,410 --> 01:25:46,290
然後轉院回劍橋
I will have him transferred back to Cambridge.

776
01:25:49,180 --> 01:25:54,040
-他很可能下不了手術臺  -他能的
- He may not survive the journey. - Yes, he will.

777
01:26:01,850 --> 01:26:03,110
我知道
I know.

778
01:26:05,380 --> 01:26:06,740
我就...
I'll...

779
01:26:07,680 --> 01:26:09,150
不去了
step back.

780
01:26:12,610 --> 01:26:14,890
你東西都帶齊了嗎
Did you get everything in the car...

781
01:26:14,900 --> 01:26:17,750
他的輪椅  設備什麼的
his chair, and his equipment, and everything?

782
01:26:38,590 --> 01:26:40,420
再見了
Goodbye.

783
01:28:15,420 --> 01:28:16,420
斯蒂芬
Stephen?

784
01:28:35,870 --> 01:28:38,080
這是個拼字板
This is a spelling board.

785
01:28:40,520 --> 01:28:41,650
我先說顏色
Firstly, you tell me

786
01:28:41,650 --> 01:28:45,030
你要哪個顏色
what letter you want by blinking

787
01:28:45,080 --> 01:28:48,320
就對我眨下眼睛
when I say the color of the group that contains that letter.

788
01:28:50,610 --> 01:28:51,740
確定了顏色以後
Once I know the group,

789
01:28:51,740 --> 01:28:54,260
我說到你要的字母
you can choose the character inside that group by

790
01:28:54,310 --> 01:28:58,310
你就眨下眼睛
by blinking again when I say the color of each letter with that group...

791
01:29:01,310 --> 01:29:03,050
...很簡單
...apparently

792
01:29:03,840 --> 01:29:05,810

她來了  很多人推薦她的

807

跟她和氣點

851
01:34:01,070 --> 01:34:04,390
它有一個十分簡單的介面

852
01:34:04,390 --> 01:34:05,920
你可以一個個字母的流覽

853
01:34:05,920 --> 01:34:07,150
每次選一個字母

把文字轉換成語音
to convert the written text into synthesized speech.

860
01:34:21,980 --> 01:34:25,270
聲音是有點像機器人  但總比...
I mean the voice sounds a little bit robotic, but...

861
01:34:25,620 --> 01:34:26,760
我們來試試吧
Shall we give it a try?

862
01:34:26,820 --> 01:34:28,960

目前我只有這一種
It's the only one lately I have at the moment.

時間有沒有盡頭
Will it ever come to an end?

884
01:36:49,090 --> 01:36:51,350
我們能不能回到過去
Can we go back in time?

885
01:36:53,110 --> 01:36:55,310
也許未來  這些問題會變得
Some day these answers may seem

886
01:36:55,310 --> 01:36:58,630
像地球繞著太陽轉一樣平常
as obvious to us as the Earth orbiting the sun,

887
01:37:00,160 --> 01:37:04,180
抑或如烏龜塔般荒謬
or perhaps as ridiculous as a tower of tortoises.

888
01:37:00,160 --> 01:37:04,180
古代人對宇宙的認識

這兩個問題如果有答案

他問我是否真的是霍金
who asked if I was the real Stephen Hawking.

953
01:49:03,450 --> 01:49:04,820
我回答說我不是
I replied I was not,

954
01:49:04,820 --> 01:49:07,970
霍金本人比我帥多了
and said the real one was much better looking.

955
01:49:11,090 --> 01:49:12,770
1979年  您曾表示
In 1979, you talked about

956
01:49:12,770 --> 01:49:15,590
有望在本世紀末
the possibility of a Theory of Everything.

957
01:49:15,650 --> 01:49:18,540
發現適用萬物的理論
being discovered before the end of the century.

958
01:49:19,520 --> 01:49:22,420
我現在預言我當時錯了
I now predict that I was wrong.

959
01:49:26,760 --> 01:49:30,920
霍金教授  您說過您不信上帝
Professor Hawking, you have said you do not believe in God.

960
01:50:38,530 --> 01:50:41,280
您說過您不信上帝
You have said you did not believe in God.

961
01:50:42,670 --> 01:50:45,990
那麼您有什麼指導您的生活哲學嗎
Do you have a philosophy of life that helps you?

962
01:51:08,700 --> 01:51:12,920
我們人類也不過是高級靈長類動物
It is clear that we are just an advanced breed of primates,

963
01:51:13,080 --> 01:51:14,820
生活在一顆小星球上
on a minor planet orbiting

964
01:51:14,820 --> 01:51:17,180
繞著一顆普通的恒星轉
around a very average star,

965
01:51:17,450 --> 01:51:19,540
我們生活的銀河系之外
in the outer suburb of one

966
01:51:19,540 --> 01:51:22,100
還有上億個星系
among a hundred billion galaxies...

967
01:51:23,650 --> 01:51:28,340
然而  自人類文明誕生以來
But, ever since the dawn of civilization,

968
01:51:28,400 --> 01:51:30,180
人們就沒有停止過
people have craved for

969
01:51:30,180 --> 01:51:33,820
對世界根本規律的探索
an understanding of the underlying order of the world.

970
01:51:34,970 --> 01:51:37,130
宇宙的邊界是什麼
There ought to be something

971
01:51:37,130 --> 01:51:40,780
肯定有個特別的答案
very special about the boundary conditions of the universe.

972
01:51:42,000 --> 01:51:46,010
但是還有比沒有邊界更特別的答案嗎
And what can be more special than that there is no boundary?

973
01:51:48,550 --> 01:51:52,630
同樣  人類的潛力也不會有邊界
And there should be no boundary to human endeavor.

974
01:51:54,160 --> 01:51:56,420
我們都是與眾不同的
We are all different.

975
01:51:56,450 --> 01:51:58,920
無論生活多麼艱辛
However bad life may seem,

976
01:51:58,980 --> 01:52:03,180
你總會有自己的方式發光
there is always something you can do, and succeed at.

977
01:52:03,710 --> 01:52:07,390
生命不息  希望不止
While there is life, there is hope.

978
01:52:39,690 --> 01:52:40,990
是斯蒂芬的來信
It's from Stephen.

979
01:52:47,960 --> 01:52:49,380
天啊
Gosh.

980
01:53:08,840 --> 01:53:12,000
你眼鏡總是這麼髒
Your glasses are always dirty.

981
01:53:29,320 --> 01:53:32,780
霍金教授  霍金夫人  女王接見

My "Companion of Honor".

984
01:54:10,970 --> 01:54:13,610
幹得好  主張自由社會主義的老頭子
Not bad for an old liberal socialist.

985
01:54:15,440 --> 01:54:19,020
別擔心  你還是可以拒絕授銜的
Don't worry, you can decline the knighthood.

986
01:54:28,960 --> 01:54:31,760
謝謝你請我來
Thank you for today.

987
01:54:32,230 --> 01:54:33,830
真的很棒
It was extraordinary.

988
01:54:35,230 --> 01:54:37,850
我們這一路一直都很棒  是吧
It's all been rather extraordinary, though, hasn't it?

989
01:54:46,690 --> 01:54:48,540
你在寫什麼
What are you writing?

990
01:55:00,550 --> 01:55:04,250
看看我們的成果
Look what we made.

991
01:56:41,680 --> 01:56:52,860
《時間簡史》在全球銷量超過千萬
雖然已經72歲了  斯蒂芬依然沒有退休
繼續探索萬物理論

992
01:56:47,980 --> 01:56:52,860
他婉拒了女王授予的騎士頭銜

993
01:56:54,050 --> 01:57:03,620
簡拿到了西班牙詩歌的博士學位
她與喬納森喜結連理
簡和斯蒂芬依然是好朋友  現已經有三個孫輩

994
01:57:05,070 --> 01:57:13,650
英國大學學位分等級
一般來說  一等學位要求均分70以上
霍金的本科三年只有一次考試  也就是畢業考試
由於緊張他發揮失常  成績處在一等與二等的邊緣
因此需要追加一次面試
