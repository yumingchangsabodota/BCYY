77
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:24,570
传说 它住在这片森林里
They say it lives in these very woods.

78
00:07:24,730 --> 00:07:27,190
夜里你能听到它的咆哮
That you can hear its roar at night.

79
00:07:27,650 --> 00:07:32,150
左一个传言 右一个谣言 但据我所知...
They say this, they say that, but, as far as I know...

80
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:36,320
没有人真正见过这只龙

除了我

千真万确
I sure did.

85
00:07:45,210 --> 00:07:46,210
它长什么样
What'd it look like?

86
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:47,430
绿色的
Well, it was green.

87
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,100
浑身都是绿色
Green all over.

88
00:07:49,170 --> 00:07:51,130
除了他的眼睛
Except for his eyes.

89
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:54,770
他的眼睛是红的 就像地狱之火
His eyes were red. Like hellfire.

90
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,180
我都来不及眨眼...
Before I could even blink...

91
00:07:57,350 --> 00:08:01,770
它就抬起头 张开它有力的下颚...
it rears back its head, opens its mighty jaw...

92
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:02,940
然后喷火...
and shoots out...

93
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,780
于是我当机立断
So, I wasn't gonna waste my breath.

94
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:10,020
翻滚到一旁 跌跌撞撞地站起来...
I rolled out the way, scrambled to my feet...

95
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:11,670
准备迎接一场战斗
ready for the fight that was gonna come.

96
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:13,200
但当我举起来复枪...
But as I raised my rifle...

97
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:16,030
那只龙用它的爪子向我扑来
the dragon comes at me with one swipe of its claw...

98
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,590
把枪从我的手里打飞
knocks the gun right out of my hands.

99
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:18,620
怎么办
Now, what?

100
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:20,390
情况不太妙啊
Things are really not looking good here.

101
00:08:21,370 --> 00:08:24,200
但我还没有完蛋 还不是时候
But I wasn't gonna be done. Not yet.

102
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:26,880
我拿出我的小折刀...
I just took out my pocket knife...

103
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:29,540
一旦龙动我一下...
And as the dragon set upon me...

104
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:33,260
就送他回家
I drove it home.

105
00:08:34,890 --> 00:08:36,560
又在唬小孩了 爸爸
Scaring the kids again, Dad?

106
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:38,800
不不不 我只是在帮助他们...
No, no, no. I was just giving them a leg up...

107
00:08:38,970 --> 00:08:40,600
了解那片森林里有什么
on what's out there in those woods.

108
00:08:41,310 --> 00:08:43,980
我每天都去那片森林
Well, I'm out in those woods every day...

109
00:08:44,150 --> 00:08:46,650
我见过熊和山猫
and while I have seen bears and bobcats...

110
00:08:46,810 --> 00:08:49,810
以及你们能想到的各种鸟类
and just about every type of bird you can imagine.

111
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:53,480
从没见过龙
I have never seen a dragon.

112
00:08:54,950 --> 00:08:56,380
你没见过
Just because you don't see something,

113
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:57,580
不代表没有
doesn't mean it's not there.

114
00:08:57,740 --> 00:08:59,660
你说那是真的
And just because you say it's true,

115
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:00,910
不代表就是真的
doesn't mean it is.

116
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:04,750
可是 我现在就要过去
But, I'm headed out there right now.

117
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:06,550
回头告诉你们 我有没有看见
I'll let you all know if I see anything

118
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:09,090
巨大的 绿色的 喷火的东西
big and green and breathing fire.

119
00:09:10,590 --> 00:09:12,600
米查姆先生 我相信你
Mr. Meacham, I believe you.

120
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:15,260
很高兴你相信我 看看我的女儿...
Well, I'm glad you do. See, my daughter...

121
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:17,220
她见多识广
she knows a thing or two

122
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:19,590
但只了解她见过的东西
but only if it's staring at her in the face.

123
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,090
如果你的生活
If you go through life

124
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:22,860
只经历一些眼前的事情...
only seeing what's right in front of you...

125
00:09:22,930 --> 00:09:24,470
你就会错过很多
you're gonna miss out on a whole lot.

126
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:28,270
看 在这一点上 你们已经有优势了
See, and that's where you guys have the upper hand.

127
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:30,450
记住我的话...
Because mark my words...

128
00:09:30,610 --> 00:09:32,660
龙还在森林里
that dragon is still out there.

129
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:36,160
如果你们去了那片森林
And if you were to go out there to those woods...

130
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:38,150
去到没人去的地方...
where no one ever goes...

131
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:40,670
就能找到他
then you might find him.

132
00:09:43,450 --> 00:09:46,490
除非 他先找到你
Unless, he found you first.

133
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:06,480
抓住你了
Gotcha!

134
00:10:45,350 --> 00:10:46,360
嘿 埃利奥特

快来 埃利奥特
Come on, Elliot!

137
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:53,260
埃利奥特
Elliot?

138
00:12:11,190 --> 00:12:12,360
埃利奥特
Elliot!

139
00:12:20,610 --> 00:12:21,690
快来
Come on!

140

再高点
Higher!

141
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:00,180
你在看什么
What are you looking at?

142
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:40,150
这边吗
This way?

143
00:15:40,310 --> 00:15:41,970
我们离家很远了
We're pretty far from home.

144
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:35,950
你在这啊
There you are.

145
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:22,570
没人会把你砍倒了
No one's gonna cut you down now.

146
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:38,960
你要走了吗 格蕾丝
You ready to go, Grace?

147
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:44,650
没错
Yeah.

148
00:17:54,110 --> 00:17:55,270
再等一会儿
Just a second.

149
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,870
拜托 格蕾丝 别再这样
Come on, Grace. Not again.

150
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:00,330
我就是报复一下
I'm just settling a score.

151
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:07,240
一次为了杰克 一次为了自己 对吧
One for Jack. One for you, huh?

152
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:09,500
没错 差不多吧
Yeah. Something like that.

153
00:18:10,670 --> 00:18:12,510
你们两个不是结婚了吗
Aren't you two supposed to be getting hitched?

154
00:18:12,670 --> 00:18:14,880
没错 就是让他保持警惕而已
Yep! Just keeping him on his toes.

155

And then...

160
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:14,670
他们下降 下降 下降
Then they go down, and down, and down!

161
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:21,180
然后...
And then...

162
00:20:35,810 --> 00:20:38,150
我想知道那位女士从哪来
I wonder where that lady came from.

163
00:20:44,110 --> 00:20:45,820
别担心
Don't worry.

164
00:20:45,990 --> 00:20:47,700
我不会让她伤害你
I won't let her hurt you.

165
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:11,010
晚安 埃利奥特
Good night, Elliot.

166
00:21:46,010 --> 00:21:47,060
埃利奥特
Elliot.

167
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:27,180
树倒啦
Timber!

168
00:23:07,970 --> 00:23:09,390
嘿 嘉文
Hey, Gavin.

169
00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:12,140
都砍到森林深处了 杰克没意见吗
Did Jack give the okay to cut this deep?

170
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:15,680
别管杰克 继续砍
Don't worry about Jack. Just keep cutting.

171
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:21,740
谁同意的砍这里的树的
Who said it was okay to be here?

172
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:23,040
我只是按他们说的做
I just go where they tell me.

173
00:23:23,070 --> 00:23:24,360
杰克去哪了
Where's Jack?

174
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:25,690
他在那
There he is!

175
00:23:28,650 --> 00:23:29,940
这也太出格了 杰克
This is so out of line, Jack.

176
00:23:30,110 --> 00:23:32,300
你们不该砍到这深处附近的
You're not supposed to be cutting anywhere near this deep.

177
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:33,380
我对此一无所知
I didn't know anything about this either.

178
00:23:33,410 --> 00:23:34,500
这不是我下的命令 格蕾丝
This wasn't my call, Grace.

179
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:35,830
那是谁的命令
Then, whose was it?

180
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,050
怪不得
Of course.

181
00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:41,430
让我来处理 好吗
Let me handle this, please?

182
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:43,300
问题是 你不会处理的
You don't handle it. That's the problem.

183
00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:45,010
你说得对 嘉文个性如此
You're right, and Gavin is Gavin.

184
00:23:45,170 --> 00:23:47,130
他是我的兄弟
He's my brother.

185
00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:49,180
嘿 我要去学校了
Hey, I have to get to school.

186
00:23:50,050 --> 00:23:51,190
你能在卡车里等吗 亲爱的
Could you wait in the truck, sweetheart?

187
00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:52,220
我们一会儿就好
We'll just be a minute.

188
00:23:53,890 --> 00:23:54,990
我们来看看地图
Let's go through the maps.

189
00:23:55,010 --> 00:23:56,050
再看一遍
Let's review them.

190
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:30,760
你好
Hello?

191
00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:46,060
等等
Wait!

192
00:25:00,750 --> 00:25:02,210
你在哪
Where are you?

193
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:08,880
你怎么上去的
How'd you get up there?

194
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:23,850
拜托 慢一点
Come on! Slow down.

195
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:25,720
你真会爬树
You're pretty good at this.

196
00:25:44,370 --> 00:25:45,410
救命
Help!

197
00:25:56,260 --> 00:25:57,640
别放手
Don't let go!

198
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:00,690
不
No!

199
00:26:08,610 --> 00:26:09,610
别碰
Don't!

200
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:12,030
我受伤了
I'm hurt!

201
00:26:27,170 --> 00:26:28,550
你几岁了
How old are you?

202
00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:31,130
五岁
Five?

203
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:34,340
那你可长得真高
You're pretty big to be a five-year-old.

204
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:39,630
你叫什么
What's your name?

205
00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:41,220
彼得
Pete.

206
00:26:41,810 --> 00:26:42,810
彼得
Pete.

207
00:26:44,890 --> 00:26:46,680
看来你确实叫彼得
You look like a Pete.

208
00:26:46,850 --> 00:26:48,290
- 我叫娜塔莉 - 娜塔莉

211
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:54,540
你在想什么 你不能这么跑出来
What were you thinking? You can't run away like that.

212
00:26:54,570 --> 00:26:55,660
你怎么了
What happened to you?

213
00:26:56,030 --> 00:26:57,240
我从树上摔下来了
I fell out of a tree.

214
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:58,730
你从树上摔下来了
You fell out of a tree?

215
00:26:58,910 --> 00:27:00,110
你在树上干嘛
What were you doing in a tree?

216
00:27:00,950 --> 00:27:02,120
跟着他
Following him.

217
00:27:09,790 --> 00:27:11,040
他叫彼得
His name is Pete.

218
00:27:13,210 --> 00:27:14,620

221
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:21,810
等等
Wait, wait, wait!

222
00:27:26,470 --> 00:27:27,850
你来自哪里
Where'd you come from?

223
00:27:31,190 --> 00:27:33,610
你的父母去哪了
Do you know where your parents are?

224
00:27:33,770 --> 00:27:34,890
你的家人呢
Your family?

225
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:42,360
嘿
Hey.

226
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:46,620

Where'd you get that?

227
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:48,590
等等
Wait!

229
00:27:52,210 --> 00:27:53,510
这里 小家伙
Whoa, there, little buddy.

230
00:27:53,670 --> 00:27:55,010
你要去哪啊 这么...
Where are you going so...

231
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:58,600
嘿 孩子 回来
Hey, kid! Come back here.

232
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:02,840
过来 孩子
Come on, kid!

233
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:04,770
小心 嘉文
Careful, Gavin!

234
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:49,720
没关系
Doesn't matter.

235
00:28:49,890 --> 00:28:51,330
警长 游骑兵 所有人
The sheriff, the rangers, everybody else

236
00:28:51,350 --> 00:28:52,540
都会封闭这个地方...
are gonna be locking this site down...

237
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:54,970
直到找出这个孩子从哪来的
until they figure out where that kid came from.

238
00:28:55,150 --> 00:28:56,400
嘿 你听到了吗
Hey, you hear that?

239
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:58,230
别转移话题 嘉文
Don't change the subject, Gavin.

240
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:13,520
每一次 我想采取一些主动...
Every time I try and take some initiative...

241
00:29:13,540 --> 00:29:15,080
你就让我闭嘴
you shut me down.

242
00:29:17,590 --> 00:29:19,070
如果我们没有砍到这里...
If we hadn't been cutting out here...

243
00:29:19,130 --> 00:29:21,340
就不能及时发现这个孩子
we never would've found that kid in the first place.

244
00:29:21,510 --> 00:29:23,260
我们在这做好事 杰克
We're doing good work here, Jack.

245
00:29:23,430 --> 00:29:24,690
我们需要一批好木材 才有竞争力
And we need a big score to help us compete.

246
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:25,860
那几年之后...
What about a few years from now...

247
00:29:25,890 --> 00:29:27,240
因为你提前动工
when we have nothing left to cut down

248
00:29:27,260 --> 00:29:28,580
我们无树可砍怎么办
because you keep jumping the gun?

249
00:29:29,390 --> 00:29:31,110
- 你要去哪 - 你觉得呢
- Where are you going? - Where do you think?

250
00:29:32,180 --> 00:29:34,310
你不是唯一一个我操心的家人
You're not the only family I gotta worry about.

251
00:29:38,270 --> 00:29:40,310
让我知道彼得的情况 好吗
Let me know how Pete's doing, will ya?

252
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:51,610
怎么了 嘉文 杰克训了你一顿吗
What's wrong, Gavin? Jack giving you a hard time?

253
00:29:52,450 --> 00:29:53,910
你知道杰克这个人
Oh, you know Jack.

254
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:56,540
因为被女朋友骂了一顿 他很恼火
He's just sore because his girlfriend's stepping on his toes.

255
00:29:57,210 --> 00:29:58,630
那是个红头发美妞啊 伙计
Redheads, man.

256
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:04,300
- 小心 - 小心
- Look out! - Look out!

257
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:16,150
那是什么
What was that?

258
00:30:21,650 --> 00:30:22,860
我们去打猎
Let's go hunting.

259
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:29,200
彼得
Pete.

260
00:30:33,370 --> 00:30:35,420
该醒醒了 彼得
Time to wake up, Pete.

261
00:30:38,290 --> 00:30:39,450
妈妈
Momma?

262
00:30:52,390 --> 00:30:53,390
埃利奥特
Elliot?

263
00:31:23,420 --> 00:31:24,700
他怎么样了
How's he doing?

264
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:27,430
总而言之 很好
Pretty well, all things considered.

265
00:31:27,590 --> 00:31:30,170
没有营养不良或者严重的暴露迹象
No signs of malnourishment or serious exposure.

266
00:31:30,340 --> 00:31:31,940
头部应该有撞击 但...
He might have a bump to the head, but...

267
00:31:31,970 --> 00:31:34,260
- 幸运的孩子 - 非常幸运
- Lucky kid. - Super lucky.

268
00:31:34,430 --> 00:31:35,760
他怎么会在那里
How'd he get out there?

269
00:31:35,930 --> 00:31:37,970
他可能曾在那野餐或者野营
My guess, he was on a picnic or a camping trip.

270
00:31:38,140 --> 00:31:39,410
和他家人走散了
He wandered off from his family,

271
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:40,480
迷路了
got himself lost.

272
00:31:40,650 --> 00:31:42,490
当然 但什么时候
Sure, but when?

273
00:31:42,650 --> 00:31:44,740
看起来他在外面
It looks like he's been out there

274
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:47,160
待了不知道多久
for who knows how long.

275
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:48,580
他有这个
And he had this.

276
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:49,910
你确定是你的吗
You sure that's yours?

277
00:31:52,990 --> 00:31:54,070
非常确定
Pretty sure.

278
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:55,780
我们来了 都打理好了
Here we are. All fixed up.

279
00:31:55,950 --> 00:31:58,160
过来 感觉如何
Hey, there. How you feeling?

280
00:31:58,330 --> 00:32:01,340
就是擦伤而已 彼得在哪
It was just a scrape. Where's Pete?

281
00:32:02,460 --> 00:32:04,050
我要带娜塔莉回家
I'm gonna take Natalie home,

282
00:32:04,130 --> 00:32:06,340
然后再回森林
then head back out to the forest.

283
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:08,960
也许那里有...
Maybe there's something out there...

284
00:32:09,130 --> 00:32:12,130
一些线索之类的
some clue, or something.

285
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:13,840
他醒了能叫我吗
Could you call me when he wakes up?

286
00:32:14,010 --> 00:32:15,430
当然
Of course.

287
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:16,890
当他醒了
When he wakes up,

288
00:32:16,970 --> 00:32:18,970
我认为最好一切都慢慢来
I think it would be best to take things slowly.

289
00:32:19,140 --> 00:32:21,600
一步一步来 让他知道自己安全
One step at a time. Let him know he's safe.

290
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:24,110
我们不知道他经历了什么
We don't know what he's been through.

291
00:32:24,270 --> 00:32:26,690
我们给社会服务部门打了电话
We put in a call in to Social Services.

292
00:32:26,770 --> 00:32:28,860
他们知道怎么处理这种事
They'll know exactly how to handle this.

293
00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:31,950
目前 这里会照顾好他
For the time being, he'll be just fine right here.

294
00:32:33,820 --> 00:32:35,990
其实 他不见了
Actually, he's gone.

# 我曾常以为自己是流浪男孩 #
I used to think I was some kind of gypsy boy

352
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:49,510
# 在我让你带我回家之前 #
Before I let you take me home

353
00:37:52,430 --> 00:37:56,520
# 再见 玛丽安 #

# 是时候我们开始再次 #

# 对所有的一切  #

356
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:09,820
# 大笑 痛哭 痛哭 大笑 #
And laugh about it all again

357
00:38:13,870 --> 00:38:15,790
好了 我们到了
Okay. Here we are.

358
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:22,880
需要帮助吗
Need a little help?

359
00:38:24,170 --> 00:38:25,630

天哪
Oh, my goodness.

363
00:38:35,350 --> 00:38:36,890
怎么了 亲爱的
What's wrong, honey?

364
00:38:37,060 --> 00:38:38,720
你饿了吗
Are you hungry?

365
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:41,360
我们进去吧 吃点东西
Let's go inside. Let's go get something to eat.

366
00:38:42,150 --> 00:38:43,360
我想回家
I want to go home.

367

368
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:49,320
你家在哪 能告诉我吗
Where is your home? Can you tell me?

369
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,880
这样吧
How about this?

370
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:59,210
如果你现在和我进去
If you come inside with me now,

371
00:38:59,330 --> 00:39:01,910
那明天...
then tomorrow...

372
00:39:02,090 --> 00:39:03,550
我就带你回森林
I'll take you back out to the woods

373
00:39:03,670 --> 00:39:06,750
你就能告诉我 你住在哪
and you can show me exactly where you live.

374
00:39:07,510 --> 00:39:08,560
怎么样
How does that sound?

375
00:39:09,550 --> 00:39:13,010
当我还是个小女孩时
You know, when I was a little girl...

376
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:17,230
我特别想住在森林里
I wanted to live in the forest more than anything.

377
00:39:18,390 --> 00:39:20,100
我喜欢待在外面
I loved being out there.

378
00:39:20,270 --> 00:39:22,690
和松鼠啊 小鸟啊
It was so fun with the squirrels

379
00:39:22,770 --> 00:39:25,350
树啊待在一起 太有趣了
and the birds and the trees.

380
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:28,610
所以 当我长大了...
So, when I grew up...

381
00:39:28,780 --> 00:39:31,250
就把这作为我的工作 保护森林
I made it my job to protect the woods

382
00:39:31,370 --> 00:39:33,250
和里面的一切
and everything in them.

383
00:39:34,620 --> 00:39:38,090
可能还包括你
Which I suppose includes you.

384
00:39:41,130 --> 00:39:42,420
和埃利奥特吗
And Elliot?

385
00:39:43,540 --> 00:39:44,750
埃利奥特是谁
Who's Elliot?

386
00:39:46,590 --> 00:39:47,890
格蕾丝
Grace?

387
00:39:56,770 --> 00:39:57,950
你确定要留他吗
Are you sure about this?

388
00:39:57,980 --> 00:40:00,320
找到他的家就好了
It's just until we found out where he belongs.

389
00:40:01,650 --> 00:40:02,650
谁知道呢
Who knows?

390
00:40:02,770 --> 00:40:06,560
也许和他同龄的人能让他敞开心扉
Maybe being around someone his own age will help him open up.

391
00:40:06,730 --> 00:40:08,560
也许能说出他从哪来的
Maybe he'll tell us where he came from.

392
00:40:08,740 --> 00:40:10,950
你别碰它 要吃它
You don't touch it. You eat it.

393
00:40:11,110 --> 00:40:12,280
像这样
Like this.

394
00:40:13,990 --> 00:40:15,070
我得承认...
I gotta admit...

395
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:18,160
住在森林里 特立独行...
living out in the woods, doing things his own way...

396
00:40:19,460 --> 00:40:21,460
听起来像是男版的你啊
sounds like a boy after your own heart.

397
00:40:29,510 --> 00:40:31,180
我们可能迷路了
I think we're lost.

398
00:40:31,340 --> 00:40:33,420
嘉文知道他在做什么
Ah, Gavin knows what he's doing.

399
00:40:34,180 --> 00:40:36,310
你三英里前就这么说
You said that three miles ago.

400
00:40:36,810 --> 00:40:38,690
拐弯后 河就向上了
The river's up around that bend.

401
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:40,480
我们跟着走就行了
We can just follow that,

402
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:41,750
就能返回起点
and we'll be back where we started.

403
00:40:41,770 --> 00:40:43,610
那样河就向下了
The river's back that way.

404
00:40:43,770 --> 00:40:45,430
我们一直在绕圈圈
We've been going in circles.

405
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:50,280
我以前从没走过这么远
I've never been out this far before.

406
00:41:19,010 --> 00:41:20,680
你知道我们在哪吗
Do you know where we are?

407
00:41:24,730 --> 00:41:26,360
看看这个
Look at this.

408
00:41:26,900 --> 00:41:28,320
到底是什么
What on Earth?

409
00:41:29,650 --> 00:41:30,980
你得来看看
You've got to see this.

410
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:46,410
你觉得是那个孩子干的吗
You think that kid did all this?

411
00:41:47,170 --> 00:41:49,090
一个孩子怎么能做成这样
What would a kid be doing this far out?

412
00:41:50,710 --> 00:41:51,950
嘿 伙计们 看看这个
Hey, guys! Look at this.

嘉文 快走
Gavin, come on!

427
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:43,400
那是什么
What was that?

428
00:43:43,490 --> 00:43:44,490
那是什么
What was that?

429
00:43:47,290 --> 00:43:48,340
你看到了吗
Did you see that?

430
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:49,500
你看到了吗
Did you see that?

431
00:43:49,670 --> 00:43:51,270
- 那是头怪兽 - 部 那是恶魔

It was a monster demon.

433

434
00:44:03,970 --> 00:44:05,880
把唱针放上去 然后...
You put the needle on, and...

435
00:44:14,690 --> 00:44:16,270
# 没错 今天是个好日子 #

我们就是一家

446
00:44:41,470 --> 00:44:43,810
# 梦想成真 没有损失 #
Everything to gain and nothing to lose

447
00:44:45,220 --> 00:44:47,470
# 从早到晚的好日子 #
A good day from morning till night

448
00:44:47,560 --> 00:44:51,190
把头放在这里 挪过去...
Put your head here, scooch down...

449
00:44:51,350 --> 00:44:54,390
这是五岁

450
00:44:55,400 --> 00:44:59,030
# 如果你想表现良好 就要现在开始 #
You know you got to get going If you're gonna make a showin'

451
00:44:59,110 --> 00:45:00,740

# 今天是治病的好日子 #
And it's a good day for curing your ills

455
00:45:11,580 --> 00:45:15,500
# 所以深呼吸 丢了药片 #
So take a deep breath and throw away the pills

456
00:45:15,580 --> 00:45:19,210
# 因为今天是从早到晚的好日子 #
'Cause it's a good day from morning till night

457
00:45:22,550 --> 00:45:25,060
我曾到过这里 在东帕德
I was out here, at the Eastern Pad.

458
00:45:25,220 --> 00:45:27,600
我记得 那是最后一次见到指南针
That's the last time I remember having my compass.

459
00:45:28,310 --> 00:45:30,100
- 但那是... - 五十英里的东边
- But that's... - Fifty miles east.

460
00:45:30,270 --> 00:45:31,610
离我们找到他的地方
From where we found him.

461
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:38,310
# 太阳 早上好 #

# 今天照耀大地 #

# 你就能得到优先权 #

465
00:45:51,120 --> 00:45:52,780
我好久都没读过这本书了
I haven't read that book in forever.

466
00:45:53,120 --> 00:45:55,370
我识字的时候 有人给了我这本书
Someone gave it to me when I was learning how to read.

467
00:45:58,840 --> 00:45:59,840
没事的 小子

468
00:46:00,250 --> 00:46:01,250
就是电话
It's just a phone.

469
00:46:01,510 --> 00:46:04,720
# 今天是从早到晚的好日子 #
It's a good day from morning till night

470
00:46:05,300 --> 00:46:08,800
# 今天是从早到晚的好日子 #
It's a good day from morning till night

471
00:46:09,970 --> 00:46:11,470
# 从早到晚的好日子 #
Good day from morning till night

472
00:46:15,310 --> 00:46:17,640
这是埃利奥特吗 彼得
Is this Elliot, Pete?

473
00:46:20,520 --> 00:46:23,190
埃利奥特是个人吗
Is Elliot a person?

474
00:46:24,320 --> 00:46:25,370
不
No.

475
00:46:26,320 --> 00:46:27,480
他是什么呢
Well, what is he, then?

476
00:46:27,660 --> 00:46:31,500
格蕾丝 是警长 他想和你说话
Grace, it's the Sheriff. He wants to talk to you.

477
00:46:35,210 --> 00:46:36,300
喂
Hello?

478
00:46:36,460 --> 00:46:38,510
嗨 格蕾丝 神秘小子怎么样
Hey, Grace. How's our mystery boy?

479
00:46:38,670 --> 00:46:40,130
还是很神秘
Still a mystery.

480
00:46:40,710 --> 00:46:42,040
有什么消息吗
Any news?

481
00:46:43,010 --> 00:46:45,680
帕特查了失踪人口档案
Well, Pat went digging through our missing persons files.

482
00:46:47,220 --> 00:46:49,810
他的身世追溯到了很远啊...
He had to go pretty far back...

483
00:46:50,970 --> 00:46:52,720
但这不是好消息
but it's not good news.

484
00:46:54,140 --> 00:46:55,140
可怜的彼得
Poor Pete.

485
00:46:55,310 --> 00:46:56,360
我知道
I know.

486
00:46:57,190 --> 00:46:59,690
我刚和社会服务部门通过电话
I just got off the phone with Social Services.

487
00:46:59,860 --> 00:47:01,990
他们明天早上会得到他的抚养权
They're gonna take custody of him tomorrow morning.

488
00:47:02,820 --> 00:47:03,820
彼得...
Pete...

489
00:47:03,980 --> 00:47:06,020
埃利奥特是你想象的朋友吗
is Elliot your imaginary friend?

490
00:47:06,860 --> 00:47:08,230
什么是想象
What's imaginary?

491
00:47:09,070 --> 00:47:10,870
就是你脑中幻想的一个人
It's where you make someone up in your head...

492
00:47:11,030 --> 00:47:13,240
这样你就有人说话了
so that you have someone to talk to.

493
00:47:14,330 --> 00:47:16,170
能让你不这么孤单
It keeps you from being lonely.

494
00:47:18,540 --> 00:47:19,870
他们有意思吗
Are they funny?

495
00:47:20,580 --> 00:47:21,660
当然了
Sure.

496
00:47:23,050 --> 00:47:24,260
他们会飞吗
Do they fly?

497
00:47:25,050 --> 00:47:27,760
你想让他们做什么 他们就能做什么
I guess they can do whatever you want them to.

498
00:47:27,930 --> 00:47:29,680
所以他们才是想象出来的
That's what makes them imaginary.

499
00:47:31,010 --> 00:47:33,260
你也是我想象的朋友吗
Are you my imaginary friend, too?

500
00:47:35,720 --> 00:47:37,050
我是真的
I'm real.

501
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:40,890
埃利奥特也是真的
So is Elliot.

502
00:47:47,570 --> 00:47:48,700
干得好 小子
Good job, buddy.

503
00:47:58,210 --> 00:48:00,460
妈妈 外面有个怪兽
Mommy, there's a monster outside.

504
00:48:26,110 --> 00:48:27,610
我得回到他身边
I need to get back to him.

505
00:48:28,690 --> 00:48:30,940
我走的时候 他很害怕
He gets scared when I'm gone.

506
00:48:31,360 --> 00:48:32,610
他看起来像只龙
He looks like a dragon.

507
00:48:34,490 --> 00:48:35,780
什么是龙
What's a dragon?

508
00:48:36,450 --> 00:48:38,160
那就是龙
That's a dragon.

509
00:48:38,330 --> 00:48:39,460
有一首歌
Like the song.

510
00:48:39,540 --> 00:48:40,670
什么歌
What song?

511
00:48:40,790 --> 00:48:43,130
我爸爸以前喜欢唱的歌
There's a song that my dad used to sing.

512
00:48:43,290 --> 00:48:45,290
关于龙的 还有他们住在哪
It's about dragons and where they live.

513
00:48:48,380 --> 00:48:51,880
# 去北方 用你脚上的翅膀去北方 #
Go North, Go North With wings on your feet

514
00:48:52,050 --> 00:48:56,010
# 乘着风去北方 那里有三条交汇的河 #
Go North with the wind Where the three rivers meet

515
00:48:56,180 --> 00:48:59,900
# 坐在最高的树旁 #
Now plant yourself down side the tallest tree

516
00:49:00,060 --> 00:49:03,900
# 野外的天空闪烁星座点点 #
Measure the stars shining one two and three

517
00:49:04,060 --> 00:49:07,890
# 看看你的周围 #
Look all around you and see

518
00:49:08,070 --> 00:49:11,700
# 森林的深处有古龙 #
Deep in the forest there dragons will be

519
00:49:11,860 --> 00:49:15,860
# 森林的深处有古龙 #
Deep in the forest there dragons will be

520
00:49:16,830 --> 00:49:17,870
什么是北方
What's North?

521
00:49:18,040 --> 00:49:19,330
是个方向
It's a direction.

522
00:49:19,490 --> 00:49:20,740
要怎么去那
How do you get there?

523
00:49:21,830 --> 00:49:23,140
你可以看看地图
You could look at a map.

524
00:49:23,170 --> 00:49:24,670
或者跟着北极星
Or you could follow the North Star.

525
00:49:24,830 --> 00:49:27,160
如果你跟着北极星一直走到最深处
If you follow it as far as you possibly can...

526
00:49:27,340 --> 00:49:29,050
就能看到山
you get to the mountains.

527
00:49:29,210 --> 00:49:30,540
那里就能找到他们
And that's where you'd find them.

528
00:49:30,670 --> 00:49:32,210
我说的是龙
The dragons, I mean.

529
00:49:34,180 --> 00:49:35,180
嘿
Hey.

530
00:49:36,090 --> 00:49:37,760
我很久都没听过那首歌了
I haven't heard that song in forever.

531
00:49:39,680 --> 00:49:41,800
娜塔莉 你能让
Natalie, do you think

532
00:49:41,890 --> 00:49:43,600
我和彼得单独谈谈吗
I could talk to Pete alone for a moment?

533
00:49:45,020 --> 00:49:46,020
好的
Okay.

534
00:49:47,110 --> 00:49:48,200
回头见 彼得
See you in a minute, Pete.

535
00:49:55,910 --> 00:49:57,080
嘿 过来
Hey, come here.

536
00:50:03,870 --> 00:50:07,200
是你帮我找到的 对吧
You found this for me, didn't you?

537
00:50:09,880 --> 00:50:11,720
那些树逃跑的地方
Where the trees ran away.

538
00:50:14,220 --> 00:50:18,560
我十岁生日的时候 爸爸给了我这个
My dad gave this to me on my 10th birthday...

539
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:20,220
这样如果我迷路了
so that if I ever got lost,

540
00:50:20,310 --> 00:50:22,650
就知道怎么回家
I'd know how to find my way back home.

541
00:50:24,390 --> 00:50:25,390
彼得 亲爱的...
Pete, honey...

542
00:50:26,940 --> 00:50:28,940
你还记得怎么进入森林的吗
do you remember how you got to the woods?

543
00:50:32,570 --> 00:50:34,410
这是很久之前的事了 对吗
It was a long time ago, wasn't it?

544
00:50:37,990 --> 00:50:39,960
我们当时在冒险
We were on an adventure.

545
00:50:46,460 --> 00:50:47,460
你知道...
You know...

546
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:51,470
我和你差不多大的时候 失去了母亲
I lost my mom when I was not much older than you.

547
00:50:54,420 --> 00:50:56,420
我知道有多艰难
I know how hard it can be.

548
00:50:57,930 --> 00:51:01,690
但我希望你知道 你不孤单
But I want you to know, you are not alone.

549
00:51:02,680 --> 00:51:03,680
我知道
I know.

550
00:51:04,310 --> 00:51:05,310
是吗
You do?

551
00:51:06,600 --> 00:51:07,760
我有埃利奥特
I have Elliot.

552
00:51:10,770 --> 00:51:12,440
你能和我多说说埃利奥特吗
Can you tell me more about Elliot?

553
00:51:12,860 --> 00:51:14,280
他是谁
Who is he?

554
00:51:25,620 --> 00:51:27,280
他是我的朋友
He's my friend.

555
00:51:30,500 --> 00:51:31,870
这是埃利奥特
This is Elliot?

556
00:51:33,670 --> 00:51:36,540
他肯定是个很特别的朋友
He must be a very special friend.

557
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:41,850
他不喜欢人类 但他应该会喜欢你
He doesn't like most people. But I think he'd like you.

558
00:51:43,390 --> 00:51:44,390
是吗
He would?

559
00:51:47,810 --> 00:51:50,650
等着吧 明天
You'll see. Tomorrow.

560
00:51:51,810 --> 00:51:53,060
明天
Tomorrow.

561
00:51:53,900 --> 00:51:55,700
当我回家时
When I go home.

562
00:51:55,860 --> 00:51:57,410
你会跟着我 对吗
You're coming with me, right?

563
00:51:58,150 --> 00:51:59,150
当然
Of course.

564
00:52:02,240 --> 00:52:03,740
你很勇敢
You're very brave.

565
00:52:05,160 --> 00:52:06,660
你知道吗
Did you know that?

566
00:52:07,580 --> 00:52:11,090
你是我见过最勇敢的男孩
You might be the bravest boy I've ever met.

567
00:53:15,940 --> 00:53:17,240
- 嘉文 - 杰克
- Gavin? - Jack.

568
00:53:17,400 --> 00:53:18,410
你怎么了
What happened to you?

569
00:53:18,570 --> 00:53:20,770
你记得那些米查姆曾和我说的故事吗
You remember those stories that Meacham used to tell us?

570
00:53:22,150 --> 00:53:23,230
和龙有关吗
About dragons?

571
00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:25,830
不是他编的
He wasn't making them up.

572
00:53:26,620 --> 00:53:28,750
我们发现了龙 还有一间树屋
We tracked it, and there was a treehouse.

573
00:53:28,830 --> 00:53:30,000
我想开枪射它
I tried to shoot it,

574
00:53:30,080 --> 00:53:31,890
但他把枪从我手里打飞了...
but it just ripped the gun right out of my hands...

575
00:53:31,910 --> 00:53:33,190
还扭弯了枪 在它面前完全没用
and bent it like it was nothing.

576
00:53:33,250 --> 00:53:34,310
嘉文 我不能因为
Gavin, I can't just head out

577
00:53:34,330 --> 00:53:35,560
你觉得自己看见了龙
to the woods in the middle of the night...

578
00:53:35,580 --> 00:53:36,940
大半夜的就去森林里
because you think you saw a dragon.

579
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:38,750
觉得我看见了 杰克 我知道自己看见了什么
Think I saw? Jack, I know what I saw.

581
00:53:42,170 --> 00:53:43,670
你不相信我
You don't believe me.

582
00:53:43,970 --> 00:53:45,150
我告诉你 我们要做什么
I'll tell you what we'll do.

583
00:53:45,180 --> 00:53:46,320
我们会打电话给林业部门
We'll call the Forestry,

584
00:53:46,320 --> 00:53:47,180
告诉他们我们看见的
we tell them what you saw,

585
00:53:47,260 --> 00:53:48,490
然后他们就会去处理的
and then they can go and deal with it.

586
00:53:48,510 --> 00:53:49,970
好吧 我会拍到照片的
Fine. I get the picture.

587
00:53:52,100 --> 00:53:53,760
我还指望家人呢
I thought I could count on family.

588
00:53:55,270 --> 00:53:56,270
嘉文
Gavin.

别担心 明早见

"埃利奥特迷路了
"Elliot Gets Lost.

591

这是一个小狗的故事

他的名字叫..."

"他要和家人进行一场冒险

埃利奥特有..."

598
00:55:04,510 --> 00:55:05,510
等等
Wait.

599
00:55:07,050 --> 00:55:08,710
这和我给它念的不一样
This isn't how I tell it.

600
00:55:15,270 --> 00:55:17,190
你要我别念了吗
Would you like me to stop?

601
00:55:17,270 --> 00:55:18,270
不
No.

602
00:55:19,190 --> 00:55:20,280
我喜欢这个故事
I like it.

603
00:55:29,360 --> 00:55:32,740
"埃利奥特从没这么兴奋过
"Elliot has never been so excited.

604
00:55:33,280 --> 00:55:35,570
当妈妈和爸爸在扎帐篷时
Elliot and his boy play,

605
00:55:35,700 --> 00:55:37,870
埃利奥特和他的小伙伴在玩
while Mom and Dad set up the tent.

606
00:55:37,960 --> 00:55:40,550
他就属于这里
He is right where he belongs."

607
00:57:11,670 --> 00:57:13,070
你在找什么吗
You looking for something?

608
00:57:14,050 --> 00:57:15,970
你吓到我了
Oh. You scared me.

609
00:57:16,850 --> 00:57:18,480
你为什么不睡觉
Why aren't you asleep?

610
00:57:18,640 --> 00:57:20,470
你不也没睡 一个原因吧
The same reason you're not, I suppose.

611
00:57:20,640 --> 00:57:22,600
你应该听说了那个男孩
I guess you heard about the boy.

612
00:57:22,690 --> 00:57:23,820
没错
I did.

613
00:57:24,150 --> 00:57:26,360
这个小镇 流言传得很快
You know, word travels fast in this town.

614
00:57:26,480 --> 00:57:27,720
他在森林里待了多久

615
00:57:28,480 --> 00:57:29,520
六年
Six years.

616
00:57:30,320 --> 00:57:31,320
六年
Six years?

617
00:57:31,860 --> 00:57:35,070
没人能在森林里活六年
Nobody can survive in that forest for six years.

618
00:57:35,160 --> 00:57:36,200
至少一个人不行
At least not alone.

619
00:57:36,870 --> 00:57:38,870
他说...
Well... He says...

他说他不是一个人

他说这是森林里的一个朋友
He says it's his friend from the forest.

623
00:57:52,510 --> 00:57:53,930
这让我想起了...
And it reminded me of...

624
00:57:54,010 --> 00:57:55,850
我知道让你想起了什么
I know what it reminded you of.

625
00:57:57,180 --> 00:57:58,230
那个吗
That one?

626
00:58:00,010 --> 00:58:02,510
我几岁的时候 你画的来着
How old was I when you drew this for me?

627
00:58:02,680 --> 00:58:03,970
也许五六岁吧
Uh, maybe five or six.

628
00:58:04,060 --> 00:58:05,520
在你妈去世之前
Just before your mother passed away.

629
00:58:06,560 --> 00:58:09,770
我记得 你认真听我说的每句话
I remember then, you hung on every word I ever said.

630
00:58:11,030 --> 00:58:13,030
总是有很多疑问
You were so full of questions.

631
00:58:13,110 --> 00:58:14,150
爸爸
Dad.

632
00:58:14,240 --> 00:58:15,370
嗯
Hmm?

633
00:58:17,700 --> 00:58:19,750
你在森林里到底看见了什么
What did you really see out there?

634
00:58:19,910 --> 00:58:22,040
拜托 别编另一个故事
Please, don't tell me another story.

635
00:58:22,200 --> 00:58:24,200
就告诉我你记得什么
Just tell me what you remember.

636
00:58:28,590 --> 00:58:29,720
我记得什么
What I remember?

637
00:58:31,800 --> 00:58:34,720
我记得 我当时在打猎...
What I remember is, I was out hunting...

638
00:58:36,050 --> 00:58:37,590
阳光照下来...
and the sun was shining down...

639
00:58:38,220 --> 00:58:39,700
风穿过森林
and wind was blowing through the trees.

640
00:58:39,720 --> 00:58:42,430
我在想"孩子 你就属于这里"
And I remember thinking, "Boy, this is exactly where I belong."

641
00:58:43,600 --> 00:58:45,600
我停在小溪旁喝水
I stopped by a creek to get a drink.

642
00:58:45,770 --> 00:58:47,690
突然间 我发现阳光消失了
Suddenly I realize I wasn't in the sun anymore...

643
00:58:47,770 --> 00:58:49,930
我抬头看什么挡住了天空
and I looked up to see what was blocking the sky.

644
00:58:50,110 --> 00:58:53,910
我怎么只看见了一只龙
And what did I see but a dragon?

645
00:58:54,990 --> 00:58:56,580
我真的看见了一只龙
I see a dragon.

646
00:58:58,490 --> 00:59:00,080
我一辈子都没那么害怕过
I've never been so scared in my life.

647
00:59:01,580 --> 00:59:04,290
但当我举起枪 要开枪...
But when I raised my gun to shoot...

648
00:59:04,450 --> 00:59:08,080
突然有一种感觉...
suddenly there was this feeling, this...

649
00:59:09,170 --> 00:59:10,670
就像魔法一样
It was like magic.

650
00:59:11,590 --> 00:59:14,260
没有其他词能形容它 就是魔法
There's no other word to express it. It was magic.

651
00:59:15,970 --> 00:59:18,810
于是我放下枪 坐在那...
So, I put my gun down and just sat there...

652
00:59:18,970 --> 00:59:23,650
我们隔着小溪 坐在那彼此对视
and we sat there across the creek from each other just looking.

653
00:59:24,310 --> 00:59:26,110
我就坐在那看着
I just sat there looking.

654
00:59:26,270 --> 00:59:29,150
然后龙转身消失在森林里
And then the dragon turned and disappeared into the woods.

655
00:59:29,310 --> 00:59:31,680
我记得当时想"我太幸运了"
And I remember thinking, "I am one lucky guy."

656
00:59:35,320 --> 00:59:36,820
当然 没人相信我
Of course, nobody believed me.

657
00:59:37,530 --> 00:59:39,200
我知道人们怎么谈论我的
I knew what people were saying about me.

658
00:59:39,360 --> 00:59:40,320
我必须承认
I must admit, there were

659
00:59:40,330 --> 00:59:42,080
有一段时间我在想"也许他们是对的"
times when I thought, "Maybe they're right."

660
00:59:42,160 --> 00:59:44,830
但我想到那魔法
But then I thought about the magic.

661
00:59:45,660 --> 00:59:47,700
它改变了我对世界的认识...
It changed the way I see the world...

662
00:59:47,870 --> 00:59:49,830
我对树的认识 对阳光的认识...
the way I see trees, the way I see sunshine...

663
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:51,550
甚至对你的认识
the way, even, I see you.

664
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,040
我不会和任何东西交换
I wouldn't trade that for anything.

665
00:59:59,800 --> 01:00:02,550
所以我不会尝试说服你 我放弃
So, I'm not gonna try to convince you. I quit that.

666
01:00:02,890 --> 01:00:08,400
但也许你愿意用开放的眼光去看待
But maybe if you could just be open to looking.

667
01:00:11,310 --> 01:00:12,980
我了解那片森林
I know those woods.

668
01:00:15,320 --> 01:00:17,820
我对那片森林了如指掌
I know those woods like the back of my hand.

669
01:00:20,320 --> 01:00:22,150
我不可能错过一只龙
I couldn't have missed a dragon.

670
01:00:24,870 --> 01:00:26,500
可你错过了彼得
Well, you missed Pete.

671
01:00:44,390 --> 01:00:45,520
彼得
Pete.

672
01:00:46,010 --> 01:00:47,340

677
01:01:07,410 --> 01:01:08,990
我要去工厂一趟
I'm gonna head over to the mill.

678
01:01:09,080 --> 01:01:10,710
和嘉文聊聊
Talk to Gavin about something.

679
01:01:10,870 --> 01:01:12,030

# 对吗 #

832
01:14:55,450 --> 01:14:56,630
得调动整个部队

833
01:14:56,660 --> 01:14:58,260
你真的得进来看看
You really have to come inside and see this.

所以 如果有人有什么意见 也该我说
So, if anyone tries to tell you any different, it's mine.

839
01:15:08,460 --> 01:15:09,460
它属于我
It belongs to me.

840
01:15:09,790 --> 01:15:11,000
我想看看
I wanna see!

841
01:15:11,630 --> 01:15:12,900
我们为什么要站在外面
Why are we standing outside?

842
01:15:12,920 --> 01:15:14,330
我们能进去看看嘛
Can we go in and take a look at it?

843

埃利奥特 你没事吧

Me and my crew are the only ones who know how to deal with it.

848
01:15:49,630 --> 01:15:51,230
所以 一旦我们进去了 保持冷静
So, when you get in there, just stay calm.

849
01:15:51,250 --> 01:15:52,410
别一惊一乍
Don't startle it.

850
01:15:52,590 --> 01:15:54,270
别让人在我眼皮底下被吃了
Don't want anyone getting eaten on my watch.

851
01:15:54,300 --> 01:15:55,340

你们可以坐在外面...
You can sit out here...

855
01:15:59,430 --> 01:16:00,490
然后争论"里面有什么"
and talk about "What's in there"

856
01:16:00,510 --> 01:16:01,570
直到双方都气得要死

857
01:16:01,600 --> 01:16:03,600
我就想看看 都让开

863

警长 能让你的人分散吗
Sheriff, can you get your men to spread out?

877
01:17:14,170 --> 01:17:16,450
我们需要叫一架直升机 因为龙能飞
We need to call in a chopper, because this dragon can fly.

878
01:17:17,670 --> 01:17:19,080

879
01:17:19,260 --> 01:17:21,720
杰克 你把我叫过来就为了一只龙
Jack, you dragged me all the way out here for a dragon?

你知道怎么开车吗
Do you know how to drive?

887
01:17:46,660 --> 01:17:47,660
大概吧
Sort of,

888
01:17:47,740 --> 01:17:49,700
但我爸爸的卡车可没这么多按钮
but my dad's truck doesn't have this many buttons.

889
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:51,590
住手 小姑娘

你都够不着踏板 挪过去
Your feet don't even reach the pedals. Scoot over.

891
01:17:54,040 --> 01:17:55,040

Wait!

892

我不想伤害你的朋友 孩子

898
01:18:34,540 --> 01:18:35,550
抓紧了
Hold on tight!

899
01:18:47,090 --> 01:18:48,590
我还以为弄反了
I thought I put it in reverse.

900
01:18:54,890 --> 01:18:56,180
天哪...
Oh, my...

901
01:18:58,310 --> 01:18:59,560
那不是真的吧
That isn't real, is it?

902
01:19:00,440 --> 01:19:02,150
跟着那只龙
Follow that dragon!

903
01:19:04,400 --> 01:19:06,270
嘿 嘿
Hey! Hey!

904
01:19:06,450 --> 01:19:07,620
抱歉
Sorry about that.

905
01:19:24,380 --> 01:19:28,130
告诉那只龙坚持住 我们有客人了
Tell that dragon to hang on. We've got company.

906
01:19:34,850 --> 01:19:36,290
所有分队注意
Attention all units.

907
01:19:36,310 --> 01:19:39,190
我们在米尔黑文路向东行驶 追捕一只...
We're eastbound on Millhaven Road in pursuit of a...

908
01:19:39,350 --> 01:19:41,140
一只龙 一只龙
A dragon! It's a dragon!

909
01:19:41,310 --> 01:19:43,150
你不能在无线电里说龙
You can't say dragon over the radio.

910
01:20:10,550 --> 01:20:11,550
埃利奥特

Not a chance!

918

That fool's out of his mind.

923
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:20,920
- 停车 - 我在停

好吧 坐稳了
Okay, hang on tight.

926

我们得换个法子了
We're going to have to do this another way.

927

954
01:27:25,490 --> 01:27:27,950
我们不能再留在这了
We can't stay here anymore.

955
01:27:36,330 --> 01:27:40,750
人们知道你在这里 他们会来找你

亲爱的 看啊
Honey, look.

959
01:32:36,880 --> 01:32:39,590
再也没人见过那只龙
No one ever saw that dragon again.

960
01:32:39,760 --> 01:32:42,310
我也没讲过关于它的其他传说
And I never told another tale about it.

961
01:32:42,470 --> 01:32:44,970
那天之后 也不必说了
I didn't have to. Not after that day.

962
01:32:47,270 --> 01:32:48,400
人们四处寻找
Folks looked high and low,

963
01:32:48,480 --> 01:32:50,570
但都徒劳无功
but it was nowhere to be found.

964
01:32:52,270 --> 01:32:53,810
有人说他飞去了其他的森林
Some said he flew to another forest

965
01:32:53,940 --> 01:32:55,730
很远很远
far, far away.

966
01:32:56,730 --> 01:32:58,940
但那些只是故事
But those were just stories.

967
01:33:00,570 --> 01:33:02,610
时光飞逝
Time marched on.

968
01:33:03,120 --> 01:33:04,790
孩子长大
Children got older.

969
01:33:05,330 --> 01:33:09,170
树木茁壮 故事也变长
Trees growed taller. Tales growed taller, too.

970
01:33:09,750 --> 01:33:13,460
最好的故事也会结束
By and by, even the best ones come to an end.

971
01:33:15,130 --> 01:33:18,930
但我知道有人 会告诉你其他事
But I know someone who would tell you otherwise.

972
01:33:29,270 --> 01:33:30,360
有一个小男孩
There's one little boy

973
01:33:30,480 --> 01:33:33,030
能告诉你整个故事
who could tell you the whole story.

974
01:33:33,190 --> 01:33:36,150
他能告诉你 接下来发生了什么
He could even tell you what happens next.

975
01:33:36,650 --> 01:33:39,870
他知道北极星是夜空中最亮的星
He knows that the North Star shines brightest of all.

976
01:33:40,650 --> 01:33:43,230
他知道森林里有魔法
He knows that there's magic in the woods,

977
01:33:43,320 --> 01:33:45,530
如果你知道在哪的话
if you know where to look for it.

978
01:33:46,870 --> 01:33:49,790
他知道他的龙还在那里
He knows his dragon is still out there.

979
01:33:50,830 --> 01:33:53,620
也许 如果你走运...
Maybe, if you're lucky...

980
01:33:53,790 --> 01:33:55,660
同一个男孩...
that same boy...

981
01:33:55,840 --> 01:33:57,510
我见过最勇敢的男孩...
the bravest boy I've ever met...

982
01:33:58,960 --> 01:34:00,670
他能告诉你哪里能找到他
he could tell you where to find him.

983
01:35:11,540 --> 01:35:14,590
# 你为自己画下蓝图 #
You had your maps drawn

984
01:35:14,710 --> 01:35:18,760
# 你心中已有盘算 只为仅有的希望 #
You had other plans to hang your hopes on

985
01:35:19,170 --> 01:35:23,300
# 每条路都让你绝望 怀疑自己的选择  #
Every road they led you down, Felt so wrong

986
01:35:24,420 --> 01:35:26,550

987
01:35:29,640 --> 01:35:32,650
# 你宽阔的胸怀 #

The way you see the world, It got you this far

989
01:35:37,270 --> 01:35:41,700

You might have some bruises and a few scars

990
01:35:42,530 --> 01:35:45,120
# 但你知道你终究会安然无恙 #
But you know you're gonna be okay

991
01:35:47,410 --> 01:35:49,620
# 即便你恐惧害怕 #
And even though you're scared

992
01:35:49,700 --> 01:35:52,000
# 你仍是最坚强的那个 #
You're stronger than you know

993
01:35:52,870 --> 01:35:55,420
# 如果你迷失于没有一丝光亮的黑暗 #
If you're lost out where the lights are blinding

994
01:35:55,500 --> 01:35:57,380
# 置身于没有一丝星光的黑夜 #
Caught and all the stars are hiding

995
01:35:57,460 --> 01:36:00,840
# 那时 原野的呼唤会指引你回家的路 #
That's when something wild calls you home

996
01:36:00,920 --> 01:36:01,920
# 家 #
Home

997
01:36:01,960 --> 01:36:04,420
# 如果恐惧让你徘徊原地 #
If you face the fear that keeps you frozen

998
01:36:04,510 --> 01:36:06,600
# 投身无边汪洋追逐远方 #
Chase the sky into the ocean
