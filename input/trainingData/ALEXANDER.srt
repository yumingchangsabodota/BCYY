Maybe this is the time to wean him from the pacifier.

405
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:21,940
亲爱的 你说的倒简单
Honey, easy for you to say.

406
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:23,730
又不是你整天跟他一起
You're not here with him all day.

407
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:29,740
愿我去追寻梦想 一个美丽的梦想
Think of a wonderful thought Any merry little thought

408
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:31,540
像云朵天上飘啊飘
Think of Christmas, think of snow

409
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:33,340
也像雪花飞啊飞
Think of sleigh bells, off you go

我感觉没人懂我
I feel like no one understands me.

414

415
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,531

418
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:12,620
你觉得我不可思议?

422
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:26,820
才不 是我更爱你
No, I love you more.

423
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:29,780
别勾引我过去抱你的小屁屁哦
And don't get me started on that cute little butt of yours.

424
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:31,081
说啥?
What?

425
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:33,900
咋了?
What?

426
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,140
为啥要对我说"咋了"?
Why are you "what" -ing me?

427
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:36,646
你什么情况?
What's your problem?

428
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:39,180
- 你说啥? - 你不知道我很讨厌你吗
- Excuse me? - You know what? You're so annoying.

429
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:41,050
你能不能哪怕冷静一秒钟?
Why can't you just chill out? For one second?

430
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:42,780
你真讨厌
You're exhausting.

431
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:44,241
你开玩笑呢?
Are you kidding?

432
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,802
西莉娅 抱歉 刚是我的傻逼弟弟
Sorry, Celia. That was my idiot brother.

433
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:53,811
西莉娅?
Celia?

434
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:56,131
不会吧
Seriously?

435
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:00,290
她不接电话了
Now she won't pick up!

436
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,380
我很担心亚历山大
I'm worried about Alexander.

437
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:07,480
这些年 他生日派对 所有人都放了他鸽子
I mean, of all the years for everyone to bail on his birthday.

438
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:12,580
自从有了特雷佛 重新上班后 他总是喜怒无常的
He's been so moody since I had Trevor and started work.

439
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:14,220
他都12岁了 不用担心
Don't worry about it. He's 12.

440
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:15,660
每个人这时候都这样
Everybody's moody at that age.

441
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:16,940
他都12岁了?
How's he already 12?

442
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:19,049
对啊 过得真快
I know. Just happened.

443
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:22,420
这就是重点 一切都太快了
That's the problem. Everything is just happening so fast.

444
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:23,500
是啊
Yeah.

445
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:24,620
这屋子就像个火车站
This house is like a train station.

446
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:27,161
人们进进出出
Everyone's coming and going...

447
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:30,802
特雷弗第一句话竟然是爸比
and Trevor's first word was "Fommy."

448
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:33,700
- 我也许听错了 - 我不那么想
- Maybe I misheard that. - I don't think you did.

449
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:35,001
好了 亲爱的
Honey, come on.

450
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:39,163
家和孩子我全包了
I got the kids covered. I got the house covered.

451
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:41,204
你在外面赚银子
You're killing it at work.

452
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:43,409
还有比这更好的么
Things have never been better.

453
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:44,580
得了吧
Oh, please.

454
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:45,900
- 没有比这更好的了? - 是啊
- Never been better? - It's true.

455
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,201
本
Ben...

456
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:50,042
你都宅家7个月了
you've been unemployed for the past seven months.

457
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,460
有压力吗
Aren't you stressed out?

458
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:53,966
一点
Yeah. A little bit.

459
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:56,404
那你为啥不紧张?
Why aren't you freaking out more?

460
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:58,780
紧张能有什么好的
What good would freaking out do?

461
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:01,367
要有的话 我早就紧张了
Then I'd just be freaked out and unemployed.

462
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:07,050
明天我会搞定面试的
Tomorrow I'm gonna nail that interview.

463
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:10,726
马到成功
Big day tomorrow.

You ever feel alone in the world?

467

我就是想让他们明白
I just wish they understood!

468
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:37,860
只是想让他们知道
I just wish they knew what it felt like...

469
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:41,084
可怕 糟糕又倒霉的一天是个什么样子
to have a terrible, horrible, no good, very bad day!

470
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:30,485
你们貌似该起床了
Shouldn't you guys be up?

471

整本书出现了15次之多

602
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:11,220
肯定是印刷那边出毛病了
But it must be some horrible mistake at the printer!

603
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:14,500
这我不清楚 库珀 你最后核对的
I don't know, Cooper. You're the one who did the final proof!

604

We can't have that in a children's book!

605
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:19,700
我们刚才暂停活动了 所以这没啥问题

00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:32,380
他不会读的
He won't read it.

611
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:35,650

00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:48,620
菲利普·帕克的事儿知道了吗
Have you heard about Philip Parker?

617
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:50,980
别跟我提他那惊世骇俗的派对了
I don't wanna hear anything more about his amazing party.

618
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:52,441
不是 他不开了
No. It's canceled.

619
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:53,900
啥?
What?

620
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,620
他长水痘了

屁股上都长了
They're even in his butt crack.

624
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:04,940
这么说 派对他不办了?
So, his party's not on?

625
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:06,780
不办了 所以大家又要参加你的了
No! So everyone's coming to yours again!

626
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:08,780
- 真的? - 是啊 
- Really? - Great, right?

627
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:10,525
水痘救了你
His pox is your gain.

628
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:14,881
我得去一下
I gotta go. I gotta go.

Today's a new day, and I thought that we could go ahead...

I actually feel bad Philip's gonna miss such a sweet party, but...

"就在今天 你长大了
"Today's the day. You're growing up!

744
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:24,980
我来帮你
"I'm here to help you...

745
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:26,380
纵身拉屎"
"take that dump!"

746
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:27,940
别读拉 先生
Please don't, sir!

747
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:30,004
"在水池拉
"Take that dump in the pool!

748
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,248
床上拉
"Take that dump on the bed!

749
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:37,645
但是可别在你哥哥头上拉"
"But, don't take a dump on your, on your brother's head.

750
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:40,260
"你可以像青蛙一样拉
"You can take a dump like a frog.

751
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:42,688
我会像狗一样拉"
"I'll take a big dump like a dog!"

752
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:44,620
不 应该是"跳"
No! It's "jump"!

753
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:47,287
是跳 不是拉屎
It's just jump, sir. Not dump.

754
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:48,740
能允许我失陪一下吗?
Would you excuse me for a moment?

755
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:49,980
我从来没这么弄过
I never agreed to do this kind of...

756
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:51,340
他们印错字了
There was a misprint.

757
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:54,260
是像青蛙一条"跳" 印错了一个字
Jump like a frog. One little letter.

758

It was a mistake! It was meant to be jump! I'm so sorry.

759
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:59,211
她在那 头发乱呼呼的那个 这书是她的
There she is, right there, with the bad hair! She's behind this.

760
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:11,260
安心 我们肯定能成功的 是吗
Okay, we got this. We got this, right?

761
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:13,660
你好吗 准备好了吗
You good? You cool? You ready?

762
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:16,247
你也准备好了吧
You ready to nail this? All right.

763
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:21,921
哇
Wow.

764
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:35,700
嘿 他们等着你呢
Hey, man, guys are ready for you.

765
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:38,162
- 走吧 - 好的 谢了
- Let's go. - Great, thank you.

766
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:41,100
开始我们还觉得有点奇怪呢
At first we thought it was a little weird

767
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:42,220
你为什么会来应聘这工作
that you even applied for this job...

768
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:45,967
因为我们岁数小 可你
because we're pretty young and you're...

769
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:47,220
有点儿老
Older.

770
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:48,300
- 对 - 对的
- Yeah. - Yeah.

771
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:49,681
是有点老
Kind of decrepit.

772
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:51,420
但我们看了你的简历
But then we took a look at your resume,

773
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:53,131
你的工作经验很帅啊
and your experience is awesome.

774
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:55,740
空间站设计团队的一员啊
You're part of the space station design team.

775
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:58,820
你真有轨道力学的博士学位吗
You have a Ph.D. in orbital mechanics. I mean, for real?

776
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:00,121
真的
For real.

777
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:03,561
对不起
Sorry.

778
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:05,571
嘿 你
Hey, you.

779
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:08,408
他今儿有点不开心
He's a little out of sorts today.

780
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:13,020
他的大黄蜂奶嘴坏了 很难买
It's so hard to find the Bumble Bee pacifier.

781
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:16,140
你总想着 是吧 这样...
It would blow your mind. Anyway...

782
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:17,700
玩这个
Here you go.

783
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:19,660
他得玩一会儿
He's just gonna play for a while.

784
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:22,327
孩子们都很疯
And, kids are crazy.

785
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:23,740
他们挺有趣的
They're fun.

786
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:24,820
是啊
Yeah.

787
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:26,620
怎么说?
So, what were we talking about?

788
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:28,220
我们想开发一款新游戏
We're thinking about launching this game.

789
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:31,540
我们想开发一款空间站主题的策略模拟游戏
We want it to be a space station simulation strategy game.

790
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:34,620
想要玩家有身临其境 栩栩如生的游戏体验
We want it to be authentic and completely immersive.

791
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:36,500
听起来挺有趣啊
That sounds really exciting.

792
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:38,020
正是我的菜啊
That's in my wheelhouse.

793
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:39,700
太棒了 我们想听一些看法
Great! We wanna hear some ideas.

794
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:41,820
我觉得第一个点子是模块发展
I guess my first idea would be modular evolution.

795
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:43,180
很好
Cool.

796
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:45,540
空间站并不是一成不变的 它们会随着时间而不断变大
Space stations are not static. They grow over time.

797
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:48,980
所以一开始 空间站要设计的要小
So you would want to start with perhaps a small space station...

798
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:51,420
然后逐渐变成大空间站
and grow it into an enormous space station.

799
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:53,700
这么做我觉得玩家们应该会有机会
And I think players should have that opportunity.

800
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:55,660
添加温室啊
They could add greenhouses.

801
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:57,140
实验室啊
They could add labs.

802
00:36:57,240 --> 00:36:58,965
可以把空间站营造的
They could grow a space station...

803
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:01,529
如他们所愿
as big as their imagination.

804
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:03,940
你的小宝
Your kid.

805
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:05,580
没事儿
You know what, that'll be fine.

806
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:07,940
他可以寄养到托儿所 这都不是问题
Because we can get daycare, so that won't be an issue.

807
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:09,420
不 不是
No, no, no.

808
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:10,721
我是说你孩子现在
Your kid right now...

809
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:13,723
脸都绿了
his face is all green.

810
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:16,925
天啊
Wow, Trev.

811
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:20,211
特雷弗

打个电话
Just make this little call.

949
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:35,540
库珀 你死哪去了
Cooper! Where are you?

950
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:37,740
我家人出了点事儿 所以
My family had a little situation, so...

951
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:39,580
真的啊?真有意思
Really? That's funny.

952
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:42,620
我们这儿也不巧出了点状况
Because we're having a little bit of a situation here!

953
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:45,300
电话就没断过
The phones are going crazy.

954
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:47,204
朗读会到底是个神马情况
What happened at that reading?

955
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:48,980
来了很多人
Well, it was a really good crowd.

956
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:50,700
很多人 出席率爆棚
It was a big, big crowd. Big turnout.

957
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:54,820
家长们有很多话要说
And the parents seemed to have a lot to say.

958
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:57,100
- 他们很活跃 - 是吗
- They responded. - Did they?

959
00:42:57,200 --> 00:43:00,860
他们是不是要讲 迪克·范·戴克 要他们的孩子
Did they respond to Dick Van Dyke asking their toddlers...

960
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:03,128
像狗一样大便?
if they could take a dump like a dog?

961
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:05,500
我觉得我能相信你
I thought I could count on you.

962
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:07,404
等会再说
We'll discuss this later.

963
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,248
我很期待...我很期待
I look forward to... I look forward to that.

964
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:21,205
告诉我哈 安东尼 你上岁数了吗
Tell me something, Anthony. Are you a senior citizen?

965
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:23,211
没 考官
No, ma'am.

966
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:25,660
那你为啥在限速25英里的地方开15英里?
Well, then why are you driving 15 miles an hour in a 25 mile zone?

967
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:26,961
踩点油门 伙计
Come on, speed it up.

968
00:43:28,040 --> 00:43:31,961
看 这就对了嘛
That's right. That is right. Boy.

969

变道
Change lanes.

970
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:43,926
现在右拐
Now, I want you to take a right up here.

971
00:43:50,360 --> 00:43:52,562
不错嘛
All right. Okay.

972
00:43:58,200 --> 00:43:59,925
西莉娅的电话哈
Celia's calling.

973
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:03,220
我女朋友 估计是舞会的事儿
It's my girlfriend. Probably wants to talk prom plans.

974
00:44:03,320 --> 00:44:07,286
今晚的舞会 先不管她
Tonight's the prom. Well, I'll just ignore that.

975
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:10,810
她好像很着急找你的样子
It seems like she's very anxious to talk to you.

976
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:13,060
不 不行 我开车呢
No. No, no. I'm driving.

977
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:15,300
开车不能接电话
I would never answer the phone when I'm driving.

978
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:17,620
- 不接吗 - 不接 任何情况
- No. - No matter what circumstance.

979
00:44:17,720 --> 00:44:20,140
舞会可不是天天都有的哦
But, you know, proms don't happen every day.

980
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:21,487
对哈
That's true.

981
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:24,540
可以吗?很快就好 不会...
You sure? It'll just be super quick. It's not...

982
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:28,083
你重要的事儿 我也很重要
What's important to you is important to me.

983
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:29,601
是不?
Right?

984
00:44:32,080 --> 00:44:34,100
西莉娅 我不方便打电话现在 
Hey, Celia. I can't really talk right now, but...

985
00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:37,020
- 快放下手机 - 你说啥?
- Put the phone down! - What?

986
00:44:37,120 --> 00:44:39,500
放下手机!
Put the mobile device down now!

987
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:40,881
看路啊 
Eyes on the road!

988
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:43,291
不 不要啊 
No, no!

989
00:44:46,120 --> 00:44:47,651
你会害死我们的
You're gonna kill us!

990
00:44:54,600 --> 00:44:55,847
你神马情况?
What is wrong with you?

991
00:44:57,840 --> 00:44:59,020
你干什么呐
What are you doing?

992
00:44:59,120 --> 00:45:03,450
你在...你要干神马?你这傻逼
What are you... What are you doing? You fool!

993
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:09,325
你耍我
You tricked me!

994
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:10,806
给我下车
Get outta this car.

995
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:12,860
- 下车 - 你太操蛋了
- You get out of this car. - You're evil!

996
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:14,380
你舞会完蛋了
You prom creep!

997
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:16,420
- 我觉得他没考过 - 出去
- I don't think he passed. - Get out!

998
00:45:16,520 --> 00:45:17,721
快滚!
Get out!

999
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:39,486
这全是你的错
This is your fault.

1000
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:41,380
要是你没害我跟西莉娅吵架
If you hadn't caused a fight between me and Celia...

1001
00:45:41,480 --> 00:45:42,460
我也绝对不会去接电话
I would've never picked up that call...

1002
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:43,580
- 考试也不会砸 - 别这样
- and failed my test. - No, no, no.

1003
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:45,940
你不能赖别人 安东尼
Anthony, you are not passing the blame on this one.

1004
00:45:46,040 --> 00:45:48,420
我都说过了 今天不太适合考票
I told you today might not be a good day to take the test.

1005
00:45:48,520 --> 00:45:49,780
老爸 我今天必须考票
Dad, I had to take the test today.

1006
00:45:49,880 --> 00:45:50,980
不 你不用非得今儿考票的
No, you didn't have to take the test today.

1007
00:45:51,080 --> 00:45:52,540
全是亚历山大害的
It is all Alexander's fault.

1008
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:54,620
要是他没把特雷弗的大黄蜂杀了 
If he hadn't dropped Trevor's paci down the disposal...

1009
00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:57,380
我也就不用钻车里排练 也就不会感冒了
I never would have rehearsed in a cold car and gotten sick.

1010
00:45:57,480 --> 00:45:58,420
你也脱不了干系
That's also your fault.

1011
00:45:58,520 --> 00:46:00,380
你要是没浪费一晚上电的话
If you hadn't left the battery on in my car all night...

1012
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:01,420
我就不会迟到了
I wouldn't have been late to work...

1013
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:03,100
迪克·范·戴克也不会生我的气
and Dick Van Dyke wouldn't be mad at me.

1014
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:05,580
詹·齐米妮想宰了我 知道吗?
Chim Chiminey wants to kill me! Can you imagine?

1015
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:08,580
老妈 特雷弗哭的停不下来 我要去哪排练?
Mom, Trevor was crying! Where was I supposed to rehearse?

1016
00:46:08,680 --> 00:46:12,020
你怎么可能会撞坏街上的每一个停车计时器?
How were you able to hit every parking meter on that street?

1017
00:46:12,120 --> 00:46:13,740
算了吧 我早上洗澡的时候老妈你都看到我的小弟弟了 
When I was in the bathroom this morning, Mom saw me naked!

1018
00:46:13,840 --> 00:46:15,700
你一点也不留情啊
I don't think you left a speck of paint!

1019
00:46:15,800 --> 00:46:18,321
都赖她 她这个老婊子
Her fault! She's an evil woman.

1020
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:20,780
一件又一件啊
One right after the other.

1021
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:22,411
闭嘴!
Stop, you guys!

1022
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:24,651
闭嘴!
Okay, stop!

1023
00:46:25,840 --> 00:46:27,460
都是我害的
It was my fault.

1024
00:46:27,560 --> 00:46:30,780
所有事儿都赖我行了吧
I'm to blame for all of it. For everything.

1025
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:32,260
看到没?我就说的
Yeah, see? I told you.

1026
00:46:32,360 --> 00:46:33,940
等会儿
No, hold on, hold on.

1027
00:46:34,040 --> 00:46:36,260
亚历山大 你说什么呢
Alexander, what are you saying?

1028
00:46:36,360 --> 00:46:37,300
听着
Okay, look.

1029
00:46:37,400 --> 00:46:39,780
我昨晚自己做了一杯生日圣代
Last night I made myself a birthday sundae

1030
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:41,420
对着蜡烛许了个愿
and I made a wish on a candle...

1031
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:44,780
诅咒了你们所有人
and I think I cursed this day for all of you.

1032
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:46,460
- 你干嘛了? - 对不起
- You did what? - I'm sorry.

1033
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:47,780
我只是想让你们都知道
I just wanted you guys to know what it was like...

1034
00:46:47,880 --> 00:46:50,660
倒霉的日子是个什么滋味
to have a massively horrible, terrible day.

1035
00:46:50,760 --> 00:46:52,540
所以我许的愿
So I wished it...

1036
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:54,300
都灵验了
and now you're all having one.

1037
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:56,300
亚历山大 我真难相信啊
Alexander, as incredible as it would be...

1038
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:58,460
你会有这样的超能力?
for you to have that kind of supernatural ability...

1039
00:46:58,560 --> 00:46:59,740
你诅咒不了的吧
I don't think you can actually curse a day, buddy.

1040
00:46:59,840 --> 00:47:01,980
是啊 甜心 这不赖你
Yeah, sweetie, this isn't your fault.

1041
00:47:02,080 --> 00:47:03,300
我们只是期望的太高
We just bit off more than we could chew today...

1042
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:04,500
结果跌得很惨
and it isn't going our way.

1043
00:47:04,600 --> 00:47:06,300
我真诅咒了
No, look, I did curse the day.

1044
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:08,820
我也不知道是怎么弄的 但是它的确奏效了
I don't know how, but I did, and it worked.

1045
00:47:08,920 --> 00:47:10,500
现在艾米丽的演出泡汤了
And now Emily's gonna miss her play...

1046
00:47:10,600 --> 00:47:13,451
安东尼也不能带着西莉娅去舞会了
and Anthony's not gonna be able to drive Celia to the prom.

1047
00:47:14,120 --> 00:47:16,500
他为了能带着她出去玩可等了一年呢
He's been waiting all year to make out with her in the back of the van.

1048
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:18,300
好吧 我们不想听这些
Okay, we don't need to hear that.

1049
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:20,204
好 对不起
Okay, I'm sorry.

1050
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:22,604
真心的
I'm really sorry.

1051
00:47:23,360 --> 00:47:25,700
忘了我的派对吧
Just forget my party.

1052
00:47:25,800 --> 00:47:27,923
反正也就是那样吧
It'll be a disaster anyway.

1053
00:47:29,560 --> 00:47:31,330
不接受你的道歉
Apology not accepted.

1054
00:47:32,440 --> 00:47:33,641
听着
Look...

1055
00:47:35,240 --> 00:47:39,380
今天这一天还没有都过完呢
this day is not ruined, because this day is not over yet.

1056
00:47:39,480 --> 00:47:40,860
老爸说的很对
Dad, you're so right.

1057
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:44,060
我不能因为感冒而错过了演出
I may be sick, but there's no way I'm missing opening night.

1058
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:45,380
我也不能因为弄坏了车子
I may have wrecked the van...

1059
00:47:45,480 --> 00:47:48,300
而错过和西莉娅的舞会 况且现在还没错过
but I'm not missing prom with Celia. I can't.

1060
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:52,525
我们今天是不会被打败的
Look, we are not going to let this day get the better of us.

1061
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:54,180
就好比上个星期
It's like last week at Target

1062
00:47:54,280 --> 00:47:56,220
爸爸把特雷弗丢在了塔吉特商店里45分钟
when Dad lost Trevor for 45 minutes.

1063
00:47:56,320 --> 00:47:57,380
- 好吧 - 是
- Okay. - Yeah.

1064
00:47:57,480 --> 00:47:59,180
店长本来想报警的
And the store manager wanted to call the cops...

1065
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:01,220
但是爸爸拒绝了
but Dad said, "No!"

1066
00:48:01,320 --> 00:48:02,940
- 我们找到他了 - "我们要继续找"
- We found him. - "We are gonna keep looking."

1067
00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:04,020
你们要继续找我宝贝儿?
We will keep looking for my baby?

1068
00:48:04,120 --> 00:48:05,260
"我们会找到宝宝的"
"We will find my baby."

1069
00:48:05,360 --> 00:48:06,580
他们当时封锁了出口 所以没事儿
They sealed the doors. It was fine.

1070
00:48:06,680 --> 00:48:08,580
- 你到底什么情况? - 好了 好了
- What's wrong with you? - Okay, okay, okay, okay.

1071
00:48:08,680 --> 00:48:09,780
好了啦
Okay, guys, okay.

1072
00:48:09,880 --> 00:48:11,740
都3点了已经 我们得闪了
It's past 3:00, so if we're gonna go, we gotta do this now.

1073
00:48:11,840 --> 00:48:12,980
准备好了吗 库珀一族?
Are we ready, Coopers?

1074
00:48:13,080 --> 00:48:15,300
好啦 如果你相信精灵的话 拍拍手吧
All right! Clap those hands if you believe in fairies!

1075
00:48:15,400 --> 00:48:16,980
你还好吧 艾米丽
Emily, are you okay?

1076
00:48:17,080 --> 00:48:20,220
当然
Mom! Positivism. Let's do this thing.

1077
00:48:20,320 --> 00:48:21,700

那便是最好的开始时间
There's no better way to start

1396
01:06:01,360 --> 01:06:04,620
世界丢在脑后
Think of all the joy you'll find

1397
01:06:04,720 --> 01:06:07,241
没有话可以形容
When you leave your past behind
