Ricky, I'm Bella. Uh, you can call me Bella,

21
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:13,560
或者你愿意的话叫阿姨也行
or Auntie, if you like,

22
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:14,600
虽然我不是你亲阿姨
even though I'm not your real auntie.

23
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:17,540
但是这样更亲近一点儿嘛
But, you know, it's a bit less formal.

24
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:19,580
哇喔 你可真是个大胖小子
Whoo. You're a big fella!

25
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:24,450
你是不是把世界上所有的派都吞肚子里了啊 哈哈

他挺不错的
Well, he's nice.

28
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:29,580
是啊 我们现在有点事情
Yeah. Now, uh, obviously we've

29
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:30,860
需要好好谈谈 Bella
got a couple of things to talk through, Bella.

30
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:32,940
之前你肯定已经了解过这孩子的
Clearly you've been briefed about his,

31
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:35,460
背景情况和收养史了
uh, background and also his foster care history.

32
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:38,130
很显然 他是个真正的小坏蛋 烫手山芋一个
Apparently he's a bit of a handful, a real bad egg.

33
00:03:38,210 --> 00:03:40,530
我是说 如果你看过他的档案 你就会发现
I mean, if you look at his file, you'll see that for yourself.

34
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:44,670
这小家伙可真是劣迹斑斑 叛逆 偷窃 乱吐痰 逃家
We're talking disobedience, stealing, spitting, running away,

35
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:47,760
扔石头 踹东西 毁坏公物
throwing rocks, kicking stuff, defacing stuff,

36
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:50,240
放火 涂鸦 成天鬼混
burning stuff, loitering and graffiti.

37
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:52,150
这还只是我们所知道的而已
And that's just the stuff we know about.

38
00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:56,780
但我们希望 通过环境的改变能让他改邪归正
But hopefully, uh, change in scene will help straighten him out.

39
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:58,380
现在他有家了 他会好起来的
He's home now. He'll be OK.

40
00:03:58,470 --> 00:04:04,200
我喜欢你的乐观 非常好

Ricky 这儿就是你的新家了
Ricky, this is your new home.

42
00:04:17,050 --> 00:04:18,770
这小子可难缠了
A real piece of work, this one.

00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:21,340
Ricky
Ricky!

44
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:24,040
已经没有别的人家愿意收留你了 知道吗
There's no one else who wants you, OK?

45
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:29,680
好了 Ricky 你知道留给你的另一个选择是什么 是吧
Now, Ricky, you know what the alternative is, don't you? Eh?

46
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:35,000
- 所以这次你能乖乖合作吗 - 当然可以 我们一定可以搞定的
- Think you can make it work? - Course we can. We'll make it work.

47
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:46,100
让开点 快点 让开点
Move. Move it. Move!

48
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:47,870
我已经干这行很久了
Yeah. I've been in this game a long time.

49
00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:49,690
我们的口号是“不放弃任何一个孩子 ”
"No child left behind" Is our motto.

50
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:51,870
好吧 虽然不是官方口号
Well, it's not, you know, the official motto,

51
00:04:51,950 --> 00:04:54,390
但这绝对是我的想法
but it's definitely mine.

52
00:04:54,470 --> 00:04:55,680
另外 我们还要走个交接程序
Also, as part of the transition process,

53
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:56,910
我需要检查一下你的财产状况
I'll be needing to inspect your property,

54
00:04:56,990 --> 00:04:59,650
确保你这里的收养环境能符合我们的高标准要求
just to make sure that it's up to our high standard.

55
00:04:59,730 --> 00:05:03,220
看起来还不错 你觉得呢 Tappert警官
Looks fine. What do you think, Constable Tappert?

56
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:05,460

Well, I see he has a rifle.

63

小心别让这孩子碰那玩意儿
Just keep it away from this little guy.

64
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:33,210
天知道他拿了枪会干出什么事儿来
God knows what he's capable of.

65
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:35,920

That's a silly question, isn't it? Look at you.

77

你以前在农场干过活吗 还是你根本就是个绣花枕头大草包
You ever worked on a farm before or you just... ornamental?

78
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:52,240
Hec 想当初我们刚刚相遇的时候
Hec. Just remember when we first met,

79
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,790
你看起来也不怎么样啊
you weren't much good to anyone.

80
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:58,330
也只不过是个脏兮兮一身酒臭味的流浪汉罢了

Sorry about Hec. He's a silly old goat, that's all.

They said you liked to read, so I got a bunch of books for you,

92

95
00:07:37,890 --> 00:07:39,440
孩子 我知道你曾经历过很多磨难
I can't imagine what you've been through,

96
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:41,070
你这一路走来肯定不容易
boy. You know, I can't imagine it was easy.

97
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:43,880
但是现在这儿就是你的家
But you're here now. This is home.

不管怎样 你能来这儿真好
Anyway, it's really nice to have you here,

99

Come on. Have some breakfast, then you can run away.

111
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:53,710
见鬼 我踩到屎了
Oh man. I got poop on my kicks.

112

快滚开 臭虫

你该给我找点活干

119

你想让我干点什么吗

有啊 离我远点儿

早上好 我还以为你逃跑了
Morning. I thought you were running away.

124

我是跑了 但是有东西忘了带 就又回来了
I did, but I forgot something, so I came back.

你熟悉这个雨林吗
You ever been up in that jungle before?

127
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:34,340
哦 这不是雨林 只是个灌木丛而已
Oh, it's not a jungle; it's the bush.

128
00:11:34,350 --> 00:11:37,110
大约有一百万公顷呢 小子
There's about a million hectares of it, buddy.

129
00:11:37,190 --> 00:11:39,650
只是“灌木林”而已吗
You said "Bush".

你经常回去吗
You ever go back much?

132

Not for a long time. It's a hard journey, easy to get lost.

133

But I live here now. It's my home!

266
00:22:19,170 --> 00:22:22,250
已经不再是了 至少在他们看来 不是
Not any more, it isn't. Not in their eyes.

267
00:22:22,250 --> 00:22:24,890
没有一个女人持家 就不算家
Not without a woman to run the show.

268
00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:27,880
要不你重新娶个老婆怎么样
Why don't we just get you a new wife?

269
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:30,080
我听说网络上有很多女人
There's plenty of ladies on the internet, I heard.

270
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:34,450
太快了吗
Too soon?

271
00:22:34,530 --> 00:22:35,380
那我们就坚持继续在这里生活
What if we just keep living here,

272
00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:36,230
如果他们想把农场抢走
and if they try to take the farm,

273
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:38,900
我们就跟他们枪战 誓死捍卫到底 就像电影<疤面煞星>那样
we'll just have a shootout, like Scarface.

274
00:22:38,990 --> 00:22:40,670
虽然我们没有可卡因
Except we don't have any cocaine.

275
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:42,240
Ricky 没用的
You can't change this, Ricky.

276
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:43,100
你必须要回去了
You're gonna go back,

277
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:45,560
他们会给你找个新家的 好吗
and you're gonna stick it out in a new home. OK?

278
00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:47,180
这是不可能的 没门儿
There's no way that's happening.

279
00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:50,850
我会进灌木林里住些日子 我需要...  消失一段时间
Well, I'm gonna go bush. I'm gonna... disappear for a while.

280
00:22:50,930 --> 00:22:56,690
消失 这听起来更像是我要做的事
Disappear? Yeah, that sounds more like me.

281
00:22:56,770 --> 00:22:58,880
别这样嘛 我们可是一伙的
Come on! We'll be a team!

282
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:01,790
老天啊 你在那里面连五分钟都呆不了
Oh, for God's sake. You wouldn't last five minutes out there.

283
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:06,330
Bella阿姨说过 你得好好照顾我
But Auntie Bella said you had to look after me

284
00:23:06,410 --> 00:23:08,570
你可以给我点私人空间吗
Can you just give me some privacy?

285
00:23:22,130 --> 00:23:24,620
我听说他们会在福利院做实验
I heard they do experiments at the Boys' Home-

286
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:27,020
水刑啊 折磨啊之类的事
waterboarding, torture, that sort of thing.

287
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:29,370
有个男孩只是想多要点早餐麦片
This one boy got thrown acid

288
00:23:29,380 --> 00:23:33,190
脸上就被泼硫酸了
on his face because he asked for more Weet-Bix.

289
00:23:33,270 --> 00:23:35,730
嘿 你不能把阿姨就这么放到个箱子里
Hey, you can't put Auntie in a box.

290
00:23:35,810 --> 00:23:36,880
够了 别说了
Give it a rest.

291
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:39,280
- 但是她是想要去天堂的啊  - 她已经不在了 好吗
- But she wanted to go to the sky place. - She's gone, OK?

292
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:43,040
这就是人生 前一天你还在这里
That's life- one day you're here,

293
00:23:43,060 --> 00:23:44,580
下一天你就被装在个该死的盒子里了
and the next you're in a bloody box.

294
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:49,900
孩子 你给我听好
Just get this into your head,boy

295
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:54,210
是Bella想要你和我们一起生活 不是我
it was Bella that wanted you here, not me.

296
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:58,000
你觉得你可以留在这里 但事实上不行
I know you think this can work, but it can't.

297
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:02,420
福利院的人这个星期五就会过来
So the welfare people are coming on Friday.

298
00:24:02,420 --> 00:24:03,220
他们会把你带走
They're coming to get you.

299
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:08,760
所以 就只能这样了吗
That's that, then?

300
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:11,060
对 只能这样了
Yep... that's that.

301
00:24:38,610 --> 00:24:41,830
只能这样了
That's that.

302
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:02,280
我在这个谷仓里自焚了
永别了这个残酷的世界

303
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:02,320
我在这个谷仓里自焚了

304
00:25:03,420 --> 00:25:07,380
不信你自己进去看

305
00:25:11,910 --> 00:25:13,680
再见 Ricky Baker
Goodbye, Ricky Baker.

306
00:25:19,210 --> 00:25:20,930
天啊
Uh-oh.

307
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:25,650
快走 Tupac 快走 Tupac
Come on, Tupac! Come on, Tupac!

308
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:49,380
BGM-"Ocean blue"

309
00:26:07,660 --> 00:26:09,680
啊
Whoa!

310
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:38,300
吃了五片 还剩十片 加油 Ricky 坚持定量 省着点吃
Five down, 10 to go. Come on, Ricky. Stick on the rations.

311
00:27:11,060 --> 00:27:19,080
我受够了 Tupac 我们回家吧
Stuff this, Tupac. We're going home.

312
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,270
你迷路了吗
Are you lost?

313
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:43,270
没有
No.

314
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:44,880
是的 你迷路了
Yeah, you are.

315
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:47,110
我告诉过你 你在这里待不过五分钟的
Told you you wouldn't last more than five minutes out here.

316
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:52,020
你已经完全绕晕了头 老实说你个路痴的程度连我都感到惊讶
You got yourself very lost. I'm amazed how lost you got.

317
00:27:52,060 --> 00:27:55,050
我可是走得很快的 而且我已经在这里建立了我自己的世界
I move fast. I've got my own thing going on here-

318
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:58,120
Ricky小镇 人口  Ricky一个
Ricky Town. Population- Ricky.

319
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:00,260
是吗 现在是你回到现实小镇的时候了
Yeah, well. You're going back to Reality Town.

320
00:28:00,340 --> 00:28:02,760
没门儿 我就住在这里了
Like hell. I live here now.

321
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:04,330
才怪
Like hell.

322
00:28:04,410 --> 00:28:06,620
给我听好 跟在灌木林里转来转去浪费时间找你这个小混蛋相比
I've got better things to do than to run around the bush

323
00:28:06,620 --> 00:28:07,920
老子要做的重要事情可多了去了
looking for little shits like you.

324
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:09,120
- 所以赶紧的 给我起来 - 我讨厌你
- So get up. - I hate you.

325
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:10,130
正好 我也讨厌你
Well, I hate you too.

326
00:28:10,220 --> 00:28:11,500
你去死吧
I hope you die.

327
00:28:11,590 --> 00:28:12,180
你也去死吧
Me too!

328
00:28:12,380 --> 00:28:13,940
你不如现在就把我杀了吧
You may as well just kill me now.

329
00:28:16,690 --> 00:28:20,480
不要杀我
Don't kill me.

330
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:23,680
反正能回城市的话 我也挺高兴的
Anyway, I'm excited to go back to the city.

331
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:24,380
很好
Good.

332
00:28:24,740 --> 00:28:29,660
我等不及了 我讨厌这里 到处都是泥巴
Can't wait. I hate it here- so much dirt.

333
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,140
城市生活就很酷
It's going to be cool.

334
00:28:31,260 --> 00:28:34,620
可以搞点新货色 当个毒贩子
Get me some new gears, become a drug dealer,

335
00:28:34,740 --> 00:28:37,460
做个饶舌歌手  然后遇到飞车扫射 横尸街头什么的
a rapper, and die in a drive-by.

336
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:40,600
专心看好你前面的路
Just keep an eye on where you're going.

337
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:46,570
我都湿透了
This is wet.

338
00:28:46,650 --> 00:28:49,910
我肚子饿了 我们在哪里啊
I'm hungry. Where are we?

339
00:28:49,990 --> 00:28:51,140
闭嘴
Shut it.

340
00:28:51,230 --> 00:28:52,980
我讨厌灌木丛
I hate the bush.

341
00:28:53,060 --> 00:28:55,810
闭嘴
Shut it.

342
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:57,220
我鞋都湿啦
My shoes are wet.

343
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:59,900
还不是因为你这没用的小混蛋迷路了
You're the useless bugger who got lost in the first place.

344
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:01,120
给我记住
You remember that.

345
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:04,480
你连地图都没有么 地图呢
You don't even have a map. Where's our map?

346
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:07,390
不需要 我知道自己的位置
Don't need one. I know where I am.

347
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:10,190
就算有你也看不懂吧
Probably couldn't even read it anyway.

348
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:12,340
我为啥非要看懂地图啊
Why would I need to read a map?

349
00:29:12,380 --> 00:29:16,380
跟你说了 我知道自己的位置  再说了 阅读是愚蠢的
I already told you- I know where I am. Reading is stupid anyway.

350
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:19,260
只有文盲才会这样说
Only people who can't read say things like that.

351
00:29:24,230 --> 00:29:25,480
怎么啦
What?

352
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:29,360
不会吧 你不识字吗
No. You can't read?!

353
00:29:29,580 --> 00:29:30,440
说话小心点 伙计
Watch it, pal.

354
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:31,600
你就像那种
You're like one of those people who are,

355
00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:34,060
被狼之类的野兽养大的家伙 对吧
like, raised by, like, wolves or something, eh?

356
00:29:34,370 --> 00:29:37,080
哈喽啊 偶 Hec 偶 字 不识
Ooga booga! Me Hec- me no read!

357
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:40,660
这是啥 是字哎 偶 蠢
What's this? This is words. Me stupid.

358
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:41,800
你个小杂...
You little bast...

359
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:48,080
我的脚
Ah, my foot.

360
00:29:48,110 --> 00:29:48,700
没事吧
You OK?

361
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:52,980
不 我有事 都怪你 你个小杂种
No. I'm not OK. This is all your fault, you little bastard!

362
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:56,500
来吧 我扶你一把
Come on, let's get you comfortable.

363
00:30:12,910 --> 00:30:15,060
我不是真的认为你是杂种
I don't really think you're a bastard.

364
00:30:15,060 --> 00:30:19,000
不 你确实是这么认为的 但没关系啊 你也是杂种
Yeah, you do. That's OK, because I think you're a bastard too.

365
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:23,260
不管怎么样 这样才好 说出来就好了
Anyway, it's good. It's... healthy to get these feelings out.

366
00:30:25,420 --> 00:30:26,570
还动不了吗
Can you move it yet?

367
00:30:26,650 --> 00:30:30,710
废话 我的腿骨折了 很久才会好
'Course I can't. It's fractured. Take weeks to heal.

368
00:30:30,790 --> 00:30:34,640
<i>[Debbie Downer 《周六夜现场》中的角色 总是用消极眼光做评判]
好吧 Debbie Downer 咱能想点积极的事儿吗
OK, Debbie Downer, can we think of something more positive?</i>

369
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:38,400
或许 你可以试试写个俳句 抒发下情感
Maybe you could... write a haiku to express your feelings.

370
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:39,140
写个什么
A what?

371
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:45,060
迷失于丛林
Lost in the forest.

372
00:30:45,740 --> 00:30:49,590
疼痛的脚踝 可怜的叔叔
A sore ankle, poor uncle.

373
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:52,700
也罢 已释怀
Oh well, never mind.

374
00:30:52,780 --> 00:30:55,100
哎呦老天 我们得赶快离开这地方
Oh God, we really need to get out of here.

375
00:30:55,180 --> 00:30:56,580
你要我去找人帮忙吗
Do you want me to go find help?

376
00:30:58,450 --> 00:30:59,700
但是我活不到那时候 对吧
I'd die, wouldn't I?

377
00:31:00,020 --> 00:31:02,760
算了 我们别无选择 只能在这儿露营一段时间了
No, we've got no choice but to camp out here for a few weeks.

378
00:31:02,780 --> 00:31:03,880
但是我饿了
But I'm hungry!

379
00:31:04,420 --> 00:31:06,080
丛林里有足够的食物 只要你会找
There's plenty to eat if you know where to look.

380
00:31:06,220 --> 00:31:07,880
但是我不知道去哪里找 Hector
Well, I don't know where to look,Hector.

381
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:09,820
还有 我厕纸也用完了
And also, I ran out of toilet paper.

382
00:31:09,820 --> 00:31:10,720
把你的给我用下
Give me some of yours.

383
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:11,280
啥
Eh?

384
00:31:11,860 --> 00:31:15,150
我要拉便便 我需要拉屎 你需要拉屎 大家都需要拉屎
I've gotta poop. I need a poop, you need a poop. We all poop.

385
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:17,090
用树叶
Use a leaf.

386
00:31:17,170 --> 00:31:18,220
树叶
A leaf?

387
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:21,130
我恨你
I hate you.

388
00:31:21,210 --> 00:31:22,420
然后把屎埋了
And bury it!

389
00:31:22,420 --> 00:31:24,940
把你埋了还差不多
I'll bury you.

390
00:31:29,780 --> 00:31:32,360
这才不是那娃儿烧焦的尸体
This ain't no charred foster kid.

391
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:34,810
你咋知道 Paula
How can you tell, Paula?

392
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:37,580
你觉得这像人头吗 Andy
Does this look like a human head to you, Andy?

393
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:44,600
你在哪里 Ricky Baker
Where are you, Ricky Baker?

394
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:48,480
那个 我猜是那个老头把他宰了 然后埋掉
Hey, I reckon the old man chopped him up, buried him somewhere-

395
00:31:50,470 --> 00:31:52,090
或者吃掉了
Or ate him.

396
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:56,500
绝对是出事儿了 但到底是什么事呢
Something definitely happened, but I'm wondering what.

397

够了 Andy 把你的嘴闭上
OK, I'm gonna need you to shut up,Andy,

398
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:01,500
你快烦死我了

399
00:32:01,580 --> 00:32:03,300
好了 我们走
Come on, let's go.

400
00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:05,940
这事儿肯定还没完
This ain't over by a Mangaweka mile.

401
00:32:06,020 --> 00:32:08,180
找警察来 这可是紧急事件

406
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:01,090

413
00:33:57,900 --> 00:33:59,980
那是什么玩意儿
What the hell is that?

沙拉
Salad.

415
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:05,700
怎么了 你行你上啊
What? I'd like to see you do any better.

416
00:34:14,210 --> 00:34:18,720
我还从没吃过呢 你鼻涕虫从哪儿弄来的
Never eaten a slug before. Where did you get it?

417
00:34:19,450 --> 00:34:21,880
这是鳗鱼好么 在小溪下游抓到的
It's an eel. Got it down the creek.

418
00:34:22,620 --> 00:34:24,640
我知道 但怎么抓呀 拿什么抓的
Yeah, but how? With what?

419
00:34:24,730 --> 00:34:27,880
我也不知道 小技巧吧
Oh, I don't know. The knack.

420
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:31,880
哦 小技巧 什么技巧 你怎么学到的
Oh yeah, the knack. What's that? How do you get it?

421
00:34:31,970 --> 00:34:33,900
也不算什么技巧吧 就是...
It's not a thing. It's just-

422
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:36,980
就这样抓到了 这是..
You just get it. It's a...

423
00:34:37,740 --> 00:34:39,420
这是一种方法
Oh, it's a way of, um-

424
00:34:39,510 --> 00:34:42,940
一种不需要想太多 也不需要说太多
it's a way of figuring things out without having to think too hard or...

425
00:34:43,710 --> 00:34:45,880
就能捉摸出来的一种方法
or talk, more importantly.

426
00:34:47,350 --> 00:34:51,540
你知道 大多数死于丛林里的人 被发现的时候都是赤身裸体的
You know, most people who die in the bush- they're found naked.

427
00:34:51,700 --> 00:34:52,380
妈呀
Ew.

428
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:54,010
嗯 他们太害怕了
Yeah, they panic, and they

429
00:34:54,010 --> 00:34:55,680
觉得身上的衣服一种拖累
think their clothes are slowing them down.

430
00:34:55,700 --> 00:34:58,410
就把衣服扔了 然后就被冻死了
They throw them away, and then the cold gets to them.

431
00:34:58,490 --> 00:35:02,010
但生存的窍门是 一种技巧
But the trick is- this is the knack-

432
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:06,280
你要保持冷静 寻找水源 顺着它向高处走
you stay calm, you look for water, you follow it to high ground

433
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:07,620
直到能够看清方位
until you can see what's going on.

434
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:13,400
如果之前我走失了 你会怎么办 会想念我吗
What would you do if I got lost today? Would you miss me?

435
00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:20,980
你没有走失 所以 这很好
Well, you- you didn't get lost, so... that's good.

436
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:23,420
你想念Bella阿姨吗
Do you miss Auntie Bella?

437
00:35:25,850 --> 00:35:29,040
嗯 你还没走出来
Yeah, you're still processing.

438
00:35:30,390 --> 00:35:34,810
难过的事情发生后你要这么做 你要走出来
You got to do that when sad things happen- process it.

439
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:39,920
就像我的朋友Amber死了之后 我花了很长时间才走出来
That's like when my mate Amber died. I processed that for ages.

440
00:35:40,870 --> 00:35:42,280
谁是Amber
Who's Amber?

441
00:35:43,870 --> 00:35:46,390
我们都被同个家庭收养过一段时间
We were in a home together for a while,

442
00:35:47,260 --> 00:35:49,000
然后她去了一个新家
and she went to this new

443
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:51,980
然后就惹上了很多麻烦
family and then started getting in trouble,

444
00:35:51,980 --> 00:35:53,460
她说了新爸爸的事儿
telling stories about the dad.

445
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:57,200
然后有一天 她就死了
And then one day she was just dead.

446
00:35:58,620 --> 00:36:00,260
死了 怎么死的
What do you mean dead? How?

447
00:36:01,460 --> 00:36:03,220
不知道 没人告诉我
Don't know. No one told me.

448
00:36:11,970 --> 00:36:14,060
这个鼻涕虫真的蛮好吃的
This slug is actually pretty good.

449
00:36:27,850 --> 00:36:30,620
好了 是时候离开这儿了
Come on, it's time to get out of here.

452
00:36:44,860 --> 00:36:46,880
明天下午 我们就会回到农场了
and we'll be back at the farm by tomorrow arvo.

453
00:36:49,270 --> 00:36:50,220

- A nice, warm fire. - Get out, you mongrels.

457
00:36:59,340 --> 00:37:02,100
拜托 拜托 给我点信号
Come on. Come on. Give me some bars

458
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:04,070

他完好无损 基本算是放了个假
He's fine. It was basically a holiday.

516
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:37,700
也不真放假 因为他让我干事情
Not a real holiday, because he made me do stuff.

517
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:41,460
什么事情
Like what?

518
00:39:41,660 --> 00:39:45,830
就 那事儿呗 他腿脚不便 所以就让我帮他做
Just stuff. He had a sore leg, so he made me do things for him.

519
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:48,320
一开始挺难的
It was hard at first,

520
00:39:48,340 --> 00:39:52,570
因为我的手太柔软细嫩了 但慢慢我就习惯了
because my hands are so soft. But I got used to it.

521
00:39:53,020 --> 00:39:54,880
我也不愿意的
I didn't really want to do it,

522
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:57,540
可是不这么做我又小命不保
but it was the only way to survive.

523
00:39:58,330 --> 00:40:02,380
也不是一直都很难 有时候我也会帮自己做一下
Well, it wasn't always hard. Sometimes I got to do my own thing.

524
00:40:02,460 --> 00:40:05,150
尽管他几乎从不和我一起做
He pretty much never joined in with me, though.

525
00:40:05,230 --> 00:40:09,150
我问他想不想和我一起做 但
I asked if he wanted to play with me, but...

526
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:13,560
他都会让我自己一边快活去
he would just make me play with myself.

527
00:40:14,740 --> 00:40:16,530
恶心 太恶心了 恶心死了

Yeah, but no one got hurt. You're not dangerous.

575
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:25,020
是啊 但他们觉得是

576

我蹲过号子
I've been to prison.

581
00:42:32,860 --> 00:42:35,230
那时候我还年轻 酒后闹事
Oh, I was young. It was a drunken fight.

582
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:38,170
我付出了代价 但 他们还是会狗眼看人低
Did my time, but... they won't see it like that.

583
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:40,480
我可以告诉他们你只是出来找我而已
I'll just tell them you were looking after me.

584
00:42:40,620 --> 00:42:41,680
你和他们说什么都没用
It doesn't matter what you tell them;

585
00:42:41,700 --> 00:42:43,960
他们不会信你的 他们会觉得是我逼你那么说的
they won't believe you. They'll think I made you do it.

586
00:42:44,390 --> 00:42:46,680
我不想再蹲监狱了 我宁愿住在山上
I'm not going back to jail. I'm better off up here.

587
00:42:47,060 --> 00:42:48,320
这地方不适合小孩子
This is no place for a kid.

588
00:42:48,340 --> 00:42:49,650
你必须得回去 Ricky
You're going to have to go back, Ricky.

589
00:42:49,730 --> 00:42:50,410
回哪儿

590
00:42:50,660 --> 00:42:52,100
回福利中心的人那里去
Well, to the welfare people.

591
00:42:52,100 --> 00:42:53,400
- 不要 - 他们会照顾你的

597
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:04,260
少年犯管教所
Juvenile prison.

598
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:07,660
他们完全不关心像我这样的孩子
They don't care about kids like me.

599
00:43:08,120 --> 00:43:10,000
他们只是不停地踢皮球
They just keep moving us around until...

600
00:43:10,040 --> 00:43:14,020
直到我们自行毁灭 就像Amber一样
something happens, like... Amber.

601
00:43:19,330 --> 00:43:21,640
天啊 那真够讨厌的
Oh, no. Bugger that.

OK, OK. We're in about a million hectares of bush- that's big.

603
00:43:27,700 --> 00:43:29,690
够我们在里面躲上一阵子了
It's big enough to enough to hide in for a while, anyway.

604
00:43:29,770 --> 00:43:30,680
我没意见
Good enough for me.

605
00:43:30,680 --> 00:43:31,700
但就快到冬天了
But we're heading into winter.

606
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:34,260
会很难熬 没有小屋 没有帐篷 真正的丛林生活
It's gonna be rough- no huts, no tents, real bush life.

607
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:35,060
你能应付吗
Can you handle that?

608
00:43:35,220 --> 00:43:36,260
我能应付得来
I can handle it.

609
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:39,160
好 如果你给我惹麻烦 我就把你丢下
Yeah. And if you play up, I dump ya.

610
00:43:39,420 --> 00:43:40,400
没问题 叔叔
OK, Uncle.

611
00:43:40,700 --> 00:43:42,330
我还是不喜欢你叫我叔叔
I'd still prefer if you don't call me Uncle.

612
00:43:42,420 --> 00:43:46,340
好吧 Hec 我们下一步怎么做

相当壮观 是吧
Pretty majestical, eh?

621
00:46:09,830 --> 00:46:12,250
我觉得没有那么个单词
I don't think that's a word.

622
00:46:12,330 --> 00:46:14,420
壮观 当然有了
Majestical? Sure it is.

623
00:46:14,500 --> 00:46:16,450
不 那不是真的
Nah, it's not real.

624
00:46:16,540 --> 00:46:18,360
你怎么知道不是
What would you know?

625
00:46:18,440 --> 00:46:19,980
应该是 壮丽
It's "Majestic."

626
00:46:20,610 --> 00:46:23,390
听上去没什么区别啊
Well, that doesn't sound very special.

627
00:46:23,480 --> 00:46:25,580
壮观 听上去更好点
"Majestical" Is way better.

628
00:46:27,660 --> 00:46:29,600
你觉得这地方应该叫什么
What do you reckon this place is called, anyway?

629
00:46:30,700 --> 00:46:31,960
你觉得这里会不会
Do you think it's that place

630
00:46:31,980 --> 00:46:34,640
就是传说中外套会被天空弄湿的地方
where the cloak gets wet by the sky or something?

631
00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:36,340
我不知道 那他妈是什么鬼
I don't know. What the hell does that mean?

632

Bella阿姨说她是从这儿来的

637
00:46:47,230 --> 00:46:52,800

Look, Bella didn't have any family. Like you. Like me.

638
00:46:53,160 --> 00:46:57,160
所以她才想要照顾你 还有同情我
That's why she wanted to look after you... and took pity on me.

639
00:46:57,920 --> 00:47:01,640

She wanted to save us poor wretches when no one else wanted us.

640
00:47:03,140 --> 00:47:04,620

right? He's alone in the bush. He's scared.

658

害什么怕 不 不 他不怕 他不是个胆小的孩子
Scared? No, no. He's not- He's not a scared little kid.

- and put him back in the toolbox. - OK.

662
00:48:15,150 --> 00:48:19,740
把他放到属于他的地方 不放弃任何一个孩子 不放弃任何一个孩子
... where he belongs. No child left behind. No child left behind.

663
00:48:19,830 --> 00:48:22,000
不放弃任何一个孩子
No child left behind.

664
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:26,250
他会知道这话是什么意思的

665

668
00:48:44,980 --> 00:48:48,280
这里曾经有人居住 我们还不算迷路
Well, people used to live here, so we can't be that lost.

669
00:48:49,180 --> 00:48:50,640
说不定他们也迷路了
They probably got lost too,

670
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:54,610
然后就放弃了 我们大概也会死在这里
and then just gave up. We'll probably die here.

671
00:48:54,690 --> 00:48:56,260
知道了就闭嘴吧
Well, anything to shut you up.

672
00:48:56,340 --> 00:48:59,780
只要那只蠢鸟闭嘴我也会闭嘴的
I'll shut up if that stupid bird shuts up.

673
00:48:59,870 --> 00:49:01,720

678
00:49:22,560 --> 00:49:24,710

我觉得那鸟是垂耳鸦
I reckon that bird was a huia.</i>

679
00:49:24,790 --> 00:49:26,440
这种鸟应该灭绝了才对
Supposed to be extinct.

680
00:49:26,530 --> 00:49:28,440
那很稀罕啊
That's pretty rare.

00:49:31,230 --> 00:49:33,220
想要看看这种珍稀动物

683
00:49:33,700 --> 00:49:37,180
发现它们的人肯定会...出名
And the people who discovered them would be... pretty famous.

684
00:49:37,420 --> 00:49:39,860
对 说不定还能赚点钱
Yeah, probably some money in it too.

685

友情提示 我们还需要照片作证呢

但我们没有照相机
We don't have a camera.

687
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:49,270
你上次洗澡是什么时候

大概一个月前
About a month ago.

689
00:49:51,220 --> 00:49:52,980
明显洗得不够勤快啊 是吧
Well, that's not enough, eh?

690
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:12,560
好了 伙计 我们走吧
OK, mate. Let's go.

691

Ricky 我们得做点什么
Ricky, we've got to do something.

700
00:50:46,710 --> 00:50:48,070
你不会要杀人分尸吧
Are you going to manslaughter him?

701
00:50:48,070 --> 00:50:49,430
我可受不了这么血腥的场面
Because I don't think I can watch.

702
00:50:49,510 --> 00:50:52,730
不是 你个熊孩子 我 我们必须帮他一把
No, you idiot. I'm- We've got to get him some help.

703
00:50:52,810 --> 00:50:53,980
外面有条通向河流的小路
There's a track down to a river;

704
00:50:53,980 --> 00:50:55,670
有几户人家住在林子里
there's some bush people that live down there.

705
00:50:55,750 --> 00:50:56,800
大概要走上两个小时
It's about a two-hour trek.

706
00:50:56,880 --> 00:50:59,500
我们可以在天黑前走到那里

707
00:50:59,590 --> 00:51:01,910
好吧 但总要有人留下来照顾这个人啊
Well, someone has got to stay behind and look after this bloke.

708

那你慢慢照顾吧
Have fun.

709
00:51:05,740 --> 00:51:07,770
别到处乱逛 跟着路径走
Now don't go wandering; just stick to the tracks.

710
00:51:08,740 --> 00:51:09,800
如果实在没招了
If you get desperate,...

711

就吃了你的狗
eat your dog.

712

What do you think you're doing out here, freaky kid?

He can't walk, and he's having trouble breathing.

"Uh, yeah, we need a helicopter up here ASAP. Over."

722
00:52:09,790 --> 00:52:12,280
我看起来像是带了对讲机吗
Does it look like I carry a radio?

723
00:52:12,360 --> 00:52:13,230
他生什么病了
What's wrong with him?

724

00:55:54,280 --> 00:55:56,630
他们说他很危险 你们处得来吗
They say he's dangerous. You guys get along?

793
00:55:56,720 --> 00:55:59,670
我们就像最好的朋友 我们相处得很好
Yeah, we're like best friends. We get on so well.

794
00:55:59,750 --> 00:56:02,110
他可以说 是全国最棒的丛林猎人之一
He's, like, one of the best bushmans in the whole country.

795
00:56:02,190 --> 00:56:03,870

最厉害的丛林猎人 对 我们是死党
bushmen in the country. Yeah, we're best friends.

798
00:56:10,300 --> 00:56:11,950
哦 那你妈妈和爸爸在哪里
Oh, where's your mum and dad?

799
00:56:12,030 --> 00:56:14,450
我不知道我爸爸是谁
Don't know who my dad was,

800
00:56:14,450 --> 00:56:18,450
我很小的时候我妈妈就把我抛弃了
and my mum got rid of me when I was little.

801
00:56:18,540 --> 00:56:22,630
哦 那你知道她在哪吗 有没有见过她
Oh, you know where she is? You ever met her?

Oh, pretty. She must've had you when she was a teenager.

804

你有没有试着去找她
You ever try and find her?

805
00:56:44,200 --> 00:56:47,450
算了 你没必要去 应该是她来找你
Oh, you don't have to. She should find you.

806
00:56:47,530 --> 00:56:51,390
如果你真见到她了你觉得你会说什么
What do you reckon you'd say to her if you ever met her?

807
00:56:51,470 --> 00:56:55,260
不知道 我没怎么想过这个
Don't know. Never really think about it.

808
00:56:55,340 --> 00:56:58,390
你想听听我写的一首歌吗
You want to hear a song I wrote?

809
00:56:58,480 --> 00:57:02,210
好的 这就开始 这是我原创的
OK. Here goes. It's an original.

810
00:57:11,790 --> 00:57:15,210

他肯定知道
He knows something.

828
00:59:01,720 --> 00:59:03,590

Gav, Paula Hall, Child Welfare Services. No child left behind.

832
00:59:09,610 --> 00:59:11,730
跟我说说 现在是什么情况
So, talk to me, Gav. What's the situation?

833
00:59:11,810 --> 00:59:13,300
搜查结果表明 小屋是空的
Uh, well, the hut is empty

834
00:59:13,300 --> 00:59:15,600
所以他们一定在我们来之前离开了这里
so they must've left before we got here.

835
00:59:15,680 --> 00:59:19,100
哟 看来你已经看穿了一切 Gav

837
00:59:21,400 --> 00:59:22,210
我们还在这里
Well, uh, we've, ah, set up

838
00:59:22,220 --> 00:59:24,000
设立了一个搜查队的集合点
a rendezvous spot here for the search party.

839
00:59:24,020 --> 00:59:26,760
这样他们就可以把黄貂鱼弄进来
And, uh, then we can bring in, uh, Stingray.

840
00:59:26,800 --> 00:59:28,980
什么鱼 跟我好好说说
Stingray? Talk to me, talk to me.

841
00:59:29,040 --> 00:59:30,120
简单来说就是
Oh, well, basically it's just a

842
00:59:30,120 --> 00:59:33,080
一个可以发射出错误频率的便携式手机信号塔
portable cell phone tower that emits a false frequency.

843
00:59:33,140 --> 00:59:36,100
周围五千米以内的手机会默认其为普通网络信号
So any cell phone in a 5 K radius will latch on,

844
00:59:36,200 --> 00:59:37,680
一旦连接就可以找到位置了
thinking it's an ordinary network.

845

千万别脱光衣服
And don't get naked.

853
01:00:18,440 --> 01:00:21,020
Rickey Backer 和 Hector Faulkner
Ricky Baker and Hector Faulkner-

854
01:00:21,100 --> 01:00:25,840
这两个不法之徒已经逍遥法外四个月了

迅速成为了新西兰的传奇
and fast becoming legends here in NZ.

856
01:00:29,400 --> 01:00:32,610
自从上次在木屋救了护林人之后
Faulkner and Baker's popularity is on the rise

857
01:00:32,690 --> 01:00:37,350
Faulkner和Baker的受欢迎程度正在火热上升
after a valiant effort to save a critically ill park ranger.

858
01:00:38,340 --> 01:00:40,520
全国都在全力搜寻他们
The forces are circling against them,

859
01:00:40,540 --> 01:00:42,890
这让我想起了《第一滴血》
and I am reminded of "First Blood".

860
01:00:42,970 --> 01:00:47,320
John Rambo 一个人
John Rambo, a man alone- obviously they're two men alone-

01:00:48,040 --> 01:00:50,380
不过他们是两个人
out there somewhere beyond

862
01:00:50,400 --> 01:00:53,500

the cutty grass in this dense, thick bush.

863
01:00:53,820 --> 01:00:57,470

OK? Easy, efficient, economic. All right, guys?

864
01:00:58,000 --> 01:00:59,780
我们来看看 当时发生了什么...
Take us back a step. What happened in...?

865
01:00:59,800 --> 01:01:02,710
我有些失控 然后跟他扭打在一起
Uh, I lost control and, uh, I gave him the beating of his life.

866
01:01:02,940 --> 01:01:04,000
我把他狠狠地揍了一顿
Yeah, you got him good.

867
01:01:04,220 --> 01:01:06,220
我们悬赏一万元捉拿他们
We're offering $10,000 to

869
01:01:08,860 --> 01:01:12,600
哦 要活的 要捉活的啊
Oh,... alive. They should be alive.

870
01:01:14,660 --> 01:01:16,880
他们是为自由作斗争
They are fighting for freedom.

871
01:01:17,460 --> 01:01:21,420
新西兰的自由是不可侵犯的 这是一种壮举
And we believe in freedom in NZ. It is a marvellous thing.

872
01:01:26,500 --> 01:01:29,730
Rickey 站住
Oi! Ricky! Freeze!

873

别动

又要 动真格了
Shit just got real. Again.

923
01:04:10,180 --> 01:04:11,230
丢掉你们的武器
Now, drop your weapons.

924
01:04:11,310 --> 01:04:12,860
可是我们没拿着武器啊
We're not holding any weapons-

925
01:04:12,860 --> 01:04:13,540

把螺栓都拔掉

有人悬赏捉拿你们

940
01:04:53,450 --> 01:04:54,940
赏金多少

10 grand.

942
01:04:56,320 --> 01:04:57,860
涨到二十万再告诉我们
Tell us when it gets to 20.

943
01:05:02,600 --> 01:05:04,140
如果他们问起来是谁干的
And when they ask who did this,

944
01:05:04,150 --> 01:05:06,250
告诉他们是野蛮人干的

945

什么人
The What-er-people?

946
01:05:09,230 --> 01:05:11,120
野蛮人
The Wilderpeople.

947
01:05:28,080 --> 01:05:30,480
那里是Bella的农场
No, I can't go back there. It wasn't my farm;

948
01:05:30,480 --> 01:05:31,680
所以我不能回去了
you know that. It was Bella's.

949
01:05:31,700 --> 01:05:33,340
她管理一切
She ran the show. I could do

950
01:05:33,340 --> 01:05:35,880
我只是打下手和养狗 她才是真正的农场主
stuff- me and the dog- but she was the farmer.

951
01:05:35,960 --> 01:05:37,450
她还很会做饭

是啊 她做饭很好吃
Yeah, a bloody good cook too.

953
01:05:39,770 --> 01:05:43,320
但是你不能就这么一辈子跑下去啊
But you- you can't keep on the run forever.

954
01:05:43,320 --> 01:05:45,140
你需要回到社会
You've got to go back to society, you know that.

955
01:05:45,140 --> 01:05:47,060
我对社会来说是个威胁
I'm a menace to society.

956
01:05:47,180 --> 01:05:48,860
反正 就算回去了
Anyway, if I ever went back,

957
01:05:48,880 --> 01:05:51,200
长大了最多就是个开压路机的
I'd probably end up driving a steamroller or something.

958
01:05:51,460 --> 01:05:53,200
黑帮小混混通常都是这个下场
That's what happens to gangsters.

959
01:05:53,280 --> 01:05:54,880
也没什么不好的啊
Well, there's nothing wrong with that,

960
01:05:54,880 --> 01:05:56,420
但是如果你能在别的方面做得更好的话
but if you're better at something else,

961
01:05:56,620 --> 01:05:58,340
为什么不去试试呢 对吧
then you should probably give that a go, shouldn't you?

962
01:05:58,340 --> 01:06:00,200
是没错 不过我更擅长当个小混混
Yeah, but I'm better at being a gangster.

963
01:06:00,290 --> 01:06:01,760
你才不是什么混混
You're not a bloody gangster.

964
01:06:01,760 --> 01:06:02,700
你怎么知道
How would you know?

965
01:06:02,720 --> 01:06:04,820
因为我见过真正的混混
Because I've known real gangsters,

966
01:06:04,820 --> 01:06:06,010
他们比你粗鲁多了
and they're a lot tougher than you are.

967
01:06:06,400 --> 01:06:08,210
他们应该很串吧
Yeah, but were they skux, though?

968
01:06:08,290 --> 01:06:10,250
串 那是什么鬼
Skux? What the hell does that mean?

969
01:06:10,330 --> 01:06:13,080
你懂的 就是串
You know,... skux.

970
01:06:13,170 --> 01:06:14,600
到底是什么意思
Yeah, but what does it mean?

971
01:06:15,160 --> 01:06:18,360
什么意思都有 很酷 很厉害的意思
Everything. It's cool, spunky,

972
01:06:18,500 --> 01:06:22,260
聪明 又有型 你懂的 混混都那样
brainy, good-looking, you know, gangster.

973
01:06:22,260 --> 01:06:25,060
我的老天 你真的不是混混
Oh, for God's sake. You're not a bloody gangster!

974
01:06:27,010 --> 01:06:27,760
天
Oh, jeez.

975

Get out of it, you mongrel!

981
01:06:48,340 --> 01:06:48,860
该死
Shit.

982
01:07:07,090 --> 01:07:08,170
叔叔
Uncle!

983
01:08:01,540 --> 01:08:02,880
你都干了些什么
What have you done?

984
01:08:12,040 --> 01:08:13,300
我的老天
Oh jeez.

985
01:08:22,760 --> 01:08:24,710
- 把枪给我 伙计

01:08:29,730 --> 01:08:31,560
- 但我们就不能... - 走
- But can't we just... - Go!

990
01:08:59,200 --> 01:09:00,250
写的什么
What does that say?

991
01:09:00,330 --> 01:09:01,480
Zag
Zag.

992
01:09:03,300 --> 01:09:04,280

她一路上一直跟着我们 对吗
So, she's been with us the whole time, eh?

994
01:10:29,850 --> 01:10:31,140
对
Yeah.

995
01:10:31,420 --> 01:10:35,640
这里离天堂很近

谢谢你带着她出来 伙计
Thanks for bringing her, mate.

997
01:10:47,970 --> 01:10:51,890
BGM-Leonard cohen's "The partisan"

998
01:12:43,860 --> 01:12:46,120
他们打算追捕我们到什么时候啊
I wonder how long they're going to hunt us for.

999
01:12:46,140 --> 01:12:47,710
难说
Oh, it's hard to say.

1000
01:12:48,560 --> 01:12:51,780
这些蠢货进了丛林里连你都不如
Those idiots are worse in the bush than you are.

1001
01:12:51,860 --> 01:12:54,620
无用至极 什么都找不到
Useless. Couldn't find a clown in a circus.

1002
01:12:54,620 --> 01:12:55,650
停下 警察
Stop! This is the police!

1003
01:12:55,730 --> 01:12:56,740
妈的
Oh shit!

1004
01:13:27,830 --> 01:13:28,540
什么
What?

1005
01:13:40,650 --> 01:13:44,360
我只是想给你说刚才那出跟<指环王>里的情节一样
I was trying to tell you it was like The Lord of the Rings.

1006
01:14:10,070 --> 01:14:11,240
什么鬼
What the...?

1007
01:14:13,240 --> 01:14:15,000
你看见那棵灌木了吗
Can you see that bush over there?

1008
01:14:15,780 --> 01:14:17,100
看见了
Yeah.

1009
01:14:21,080 --> 01:14:23,360
我是人还是灌木啊
Is it a man or a bush?

1010
01:14:25,290 --> 01:14:26,480
灌木
Bush!

1011
01:14:27,790 --> 01:14:28,780
人
Man!

1012
01:14:30,220 --> 01:14:31,580
灌木人
Bushman!

1013
01:14:38,170 --> 01:14:41,080
你们好啊 我一直想和你们来次偶然的邂逅呢
Hello. I was hoping to run into you two.

1014
01:14:41,360 --> 01:14:42,760
如果你是冲着赏金来
Well, if you're after the reward,

1015
01:14:42,760 --> 01:14:44,900
那就省省力气吧 我们可是危险人物
you can bugger off. We're dangerous.

1016
01:14:44,900 --> 01:14:46,240
对 很危险
Yeah, we're dangerous.

1017
01:14:46,580 --> 01:14:48,410
是啊 不 我都听说了
Yeah, no. I heard about that.

1018
01:14:48,410 --> 01:14:49,900
别担心 我可没想抓你们
Don't worry. I'm not going to capture you.

1019
01:14:50,240 --> 01:14:52,320
你们听过一个地方传说吗
You guys heard of a- a local legend

1020
01:14:52,320 --> 01:14:56,070
说的是一个独自居住在这片丛林的人
about a guy who lives out here in the bush on this own?

1021
01:14:56,400 --> 01:14:59,040
人称神经病Sam
They call him Psycho Sam!

1022
01:15:02,290 --> 01:15:02,920
没有
No.

1023
01:15:03,430 --> 01:15:05,780
没有吗 好吧
No? Oh, OK.

1024
01:15:06,620 --> 01:15:08,340
总之 叫我Sam就行了
Well, my name is Sam, anyway.

1025
01:15:09,220 --> 01:15:13,260
我是友军 来吧
I'm a friend! Come on.

1026
01:15:28,150 --> 01:15:29,280
吃饼干吗
Bikkie?

1027
01:15:39,160 --> 01:15:42,180
他为啥叫自己神经病Sam
Why do you reckon he calls himself Psycho Sam?

1028
01:15:43,840 --> 01:15:47,760
给你们的 戴上这个 政府就找不到你们了
Here you go. Put these on. Stop the Government from tracking you.

1029
01:15:47,840 --> 01:15:49,000
当我没问
Never mind.

1030
01:15:49,260 --> 01:15:51,080
你们救的那个人是个护林员
That fulla you saved- he was a ranger.

1031
01:15:51,140 --> 01:15:53,730
有糖尿病 那事之后你们得到了点支持
Diabetic. You got a little support over that.

1032
01:15:54,200 --> 01:15:55,460
但不久后你们抢劫了那些赏金猎人
But then you robbed those hunters,

1033
01:15:55,460 --> 01:15:56,580
所以你们又陷入了麻烦里
so you're back in the negatives again.

1034
01:15:56,780 --> 01:15:59,420
都怪这家伙 就是个小疯子
Well, that was... this fella. He's the maniac.

1035
01:15:59,640 --> 01:16:01,060
他们还一直说你是个危险人物
Well, they're still saying you're dangerous.

1036
01:16:01,180 --> 01:16:02,400
而且有些变态
And a bit of a pervert.

1037
01:16:02,750 --> 01:16:03,560
去他妈的
Goddammit.

1038
01:16:03,660 --> 01:16:05,420
这都无所谓啦 我这里你们想住多久就住多久
It's all right. You can stay here as long as you like.

1039
01:16:05,440 --> 01:16:07,440
我在这待了15年了
I've been up here 15 years now.

1040
01:16:07,780 --> 01:16:10,560
东西齐全 他们追你们多久了
Got everything I need. How long they been chasing ya?

1041
01:16:10,600 --> 01:16:12,380
没算过 大概五个月吧
I don't know. About five months now?

1042
01:16:12,400 --> 01:16:14,660
混蛋 政府的都这德性
Bastards. That's the typical government.

1043
01:16:14,680 --> 01:16:16,980
总是踩在小人物头上过活
Always trying to step on the little guy just for living his life.

1044
01:16:17,300 --> 01:16:19,780
没完没了 所以我没法儿回去
It never stops either. That's why I can't go back.

1045
01:16:20,500 --> 01:16:21,890
不想成为这系统的一部分
Not going to be part of the machine.

1046
01:16:21,970 --> 01:16:23,060
表格填写器
Form fillers.

1047
01:16:23,140 --> 01:16:24,740
什么表格填写器
Form fillers?

1048
01:16:26,080 --> 01:16:27,000
他们就是这么折腾你的
That's how they get you.

1049
01:16:27,080 --> 01:16:29,320
这辈子不管你想做啥 你都得填表
Anything you want to do in life, you got to fill out a form.

1050
01:16:29,480 --> 01:16:30,760
他们给每件事都做了表
And they've got forms for everything.

1051
01:16:30,920 --> 01:16:32,500
你填一张 那张就送走了
You fill it out, it goes upstairs,

1052
01:16:32,500 --> 01:16:33,980
然后你又得填另一张
and then they make you fill out a new form,

1053
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:36,100
就为了确认前一张是你填的
just to confirm it was you that filled out the first form.

1054
01:16:36,140 --> 01:16:38,480
一旦你不想填表了
And if ever you want to stop filling out forms,

1055
01:16:38,480 --> 01:16:40,780
很好 你再填五张不同的表来申请
well, there's about five different forms for that.

1056
01:16:41,360 --> 01:16:42,320
就差没拿个国家橄榄球队数目的表格出来
Don't even get me started

1057
01:16:42,320 --> 01:16:45,940
让我填  真是毫无人性
