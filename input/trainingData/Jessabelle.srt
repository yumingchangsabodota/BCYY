00:34:35,841 --> 00:34:38,275
           真是个傻问题.
           That was a really stupid question.

216
00:34:38,277 --> 00:34:41,545
           上周，听说你回来了 
           I heard you were in town last week.

217
00:34:41,547 --> 00:34:44,548
        本来想过来，但觉得应该先打个电话个你
        I would have come over,but I figured I should call first.
        

218
00:34:44,550 --> 00:34:46,683
       我试着给你打了几分钟，都没人接
      I tried you a few times, but no one picked up.

219
00:34:46,685 --> 00:34:50,320
    抱歉，我爸爸的电话在楼上.
    I'm sorry.My Dad's phone is upstairs,
    

220
00:34:50,322 --> 00:34:51,721
   应该还有好几周都不会有人接
   and it's gonna be a few more weeks

221
00:34:51,723 --> 00:34:54,291
   直到我能走上楼
   before I can walk upstairs to answer it.

222
00:34:54,293 --> 00:34:57,127
 好吧，我很抱歉           
 Right. I'm sorry.

223
00:34:57,129 --> 00:34:58,762
  能见到你真好,Preston.
  It's really good to see you, Preston.

224
00:35:00,631 --> 00:35:02,165
            我也很开心见到你 
            It's good to see you, too.

225
00:35:07,238 --> 00:35:09,106
           你父亲的事我很遗憾  
           I'm really sorry  about your dad.

226
00:35:15,513 --> 00:35:16,780
Jessie?

227
00:35:24,456 --> 00:35:26,456
Jessie, 你还好吗?   
Jessie, you okay?

228
00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:33,924
嘿     
Hey.

229
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:37,561
早           
Morning.

230
00:36:37,563 --> 00:36:38,628
早上好               
Good morning.

231
00:36:40,231 --> 00:36:41,298
呃                   
Uh...

232
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:43,333
你在这待了一个晚上？    
You stayed here all night?

233
00:36:43,335 --> 00:36:45,969
 是，我觉得要确保你没事
 Yeah, well,I figured I'd stick around,make sure you're okay.
 

234
00:36:47,572 --> 00:36:51,208
          谢谢.你不必那样做
          Thanks. You didn't have to.

235
00:36:54,278 --> 00:36:58,615
好吧，我该回去了
Well, I guess I should get going home.

236
00:36:58,617 --> 00:37:00,684
         很想再见到你  
         But I'd love to see you again, though.

237
00:37:00,686 --> 00:37:02,485
        改天再来 
        Be okay if I come by some other time?

238
00:37:02,487 --> 00:37:04,621
好的， 我也希望    
Yeah. Yeah, I'd like that.

239
00:37:07,692 --> 00:37:08,959
              好吧，你自己注意
              All right.You take care.

240
00:37:08,961 --> 00:37:10,894
呃，等等               
Uh, wait, wait.

241
00:37:14,265 --> 00:37:15,699
 别走             
 Please don't go.

242
00:37:16,634 --> 00:37:19,002
怎么了？            
What?

243
00:37:19,004 --> 00:37:21,838
如果没人跟我说话，我会疯的
If I don't talk to somebody, I'm gonna go crazy.
           

244
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:23,473
也许我已经疯了     
Maybe I already am crazy.

245
00:37:23,475 --> 00:37:25,976
  好吧,我哪也不去 
  Okay. I don't gotta go anywhere.
     

246
00:37:27,778 --> 00:37:30,645
        -就在这里           -谢谢 
   -I'll stay right here. -Thank you.         
       


247
00:37:30,649 --> 00:37:33,617
 但你不觉得我们应该换个地方吗？
 But you think we can get the hell out of this place?
 

248
00:37:33,619 --> 00:37:34,951
  这里给我一种毛毛的感觉
  Kind of gives me the creeps.

249
00:37:35,886 --> 00:37:37,354
好啊
Yeah.

250
00:37:44,395 --> 00:37:46,963
 很好，大家还在这
 Pretty much everybody's still here.

251
00:37:46,965 --> 00:37:51,635
 Rick Foster才从阿富汗回来，但我想他应该很快要回去了
 Rick Foster just got back from Afghanistan.But he's going back, I think.
 

252
00:37:51,637 --> 00:37:54,838
 他仍然是Shawna的丈夫
 He's still married to Shawna.

253
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:56,973
 如果我娶了Shawna，我也想快点回去
 If I was married to Shawna,I'd be going back, too.

254
00:37:59,678 --> 00:38:02,646
 Mary Kimball离了2次婚
 Mary Kimball's been married and divorced twice.
 

255
00:38:02,648 --> 00:38:05,515
-两次？ -她有3个小孩        
-Twice? -She's got three kids.
 

256
00:38:05,517 --> 00:38:08,551
 住在采石场新矿场附近
 Lives in that new subdivision over by the quarry.
 

257
00:38:14,425 --> 00:38:16,059
采石场                  
The quarry.

258
00:38:16,061 --> 00:38:17,961
采石场还在这儿啊？
So, the quarry's still there, huh?

259
00:38:19,563 --> 00:38:22,465
 是啊，你知道采石场就是一个超级大洞
  Yes, well, you know,it is a big, giant hole.

260
00:38:22,467 --> 00:38:23,900
你没法真的搬走那个大洞
 You can't really move a big, giant hole.

261
00:38:23,902 --> 00:38:25,535
           自作聪明.少来了 
           Smart ass. Cut me some slack.

262
00:38:26,771 --> 00:38:28,471
       Yeah.

263
00:38:28,473 --> 00:38:32,042
 什么都没变，死气沉沉的婚姻和债务更是一成不变
 Nothing's changed, really.Marriages and mortgages.

264
00:38:33,744 --> 00:38:36,780
 我知道你为什么那么急着出去了
 I can see why you couldn't get out fast enough.
 

265
00:38:36,782 --> 00:38:38,581
呃                   
Uh...

266
00:38:38,583 --> 00:38:41,718
Preston，我很抱歉        
Preston, I'm so sorry.

267
00:38:43,020 --> 00:38:46,323
 嘿，你不需要跟我解释
 Hey, you don't gotta explain to me.

268
00:38:46,325 --> 00:38:49,559
如果我能上大学，我也会远离这个小镇再也不回来
If I'd gotten into college,I would've left this town and neverlooked back.
 

269
00:38:49,561 --> 00:38:51,628
  永远不会有其它想法。
  Never would have given it a second thought.

270
00:38:51,630 --> 00:38:55,398
    不是那样的，我其实很想念这个地方         
  That's not true.I thought about this place a lot.
              

271
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:59,469
      我也想你，很抱歉没有给你打过电话    
      I missed you . I'm sorry I didn't call more.
            

272
00:38:59,471 --> 00:39:02,572
      我只是想分得彻底一点，也许     
      I just wanted a clean breakaway,I guess.
             

273
00:39:02,574 --> 00:39:05,742
       反正我的离开不是因为你      
       But me leaving never had anything  to do with you.
            

274
00:39:05,744 --> 00:39:08,011
    没事，我理解
    It's okay.I understand.

275
00:39:11,982 --> 00:39:13,616
你过得怎么样呢？             
How have you been?

276
00:39:19,557 --> 00:39:21,391
结婚了       
Married.

277
00:39:21,393 --> 00:39:24,361
哦，呃
Oh, uh...

278
00:39:24,363 --> 00:39:26,563
        她怎么想，你昨天晚上没回去的事  
        Where did she think ，you were last night?

279
00:39:26,565 --> 00:39:29,599
哦，我实话实说 
Oh, I told her the truth.

280
00:39:29,601 --> 00:39:32,369
我告诉她，我陪着一个许愿的小孩 
I told her I was with a Make-A-Wish kid.

281
00:39:41,011 --> 00:39:43,413
  告诉我后来发生了什么
  So tell me，what's going on.
  

282
00:39:43,415 --> 00:39:45,515
 你看起来很害怕回到这里
 You seemed so scared back there.

283
00:39:45,517 --> 00:39:50,053
  嗯，我回来以后一直做噩梦           
  Um, okay.I've been having nightmares.
             

284
00:39:50,055 --> 00:39:51,855
           我已经做了很多不好的梦 
           I've been having really bad dreams,

285
00:39:51,857 --> 00:39:55,125
   那些梦都如此真实以致我都要疯了           
 and they're so real that I think I'm going crazy.
              

286
00:39:59,597 --> 00:40:04,467
      我梦见一个女孩，她看起来已经死了      
     I dreamed  there's this girl.She looks dead,
             

287
00:40:04,469 --> 00:40:08,471
           她想抓住我，然后杀了我 
          and she's trying to get me, kill me.

288
00:40:08,473 --> 00:40:12,108
 还有像是被烧死的男人        
 And there's this man. It looks like he's been burnt to death,
          

289
00:40:12,110 --> 00:40:15,912
        他看着我的样子 像是我烧死他的一样    
         and he looks at me like I did it.

290
00:40:15,914 --> 00:40:18,782
       好像无论发生了什么，都是我的错       
     Like whatever happened to him,it was my fault.
               

291
00:40:18,784 --> 00:40:21,818
 你会挺过去的
 Well, after everything you've been through,

292
00:40:21,820 --> 00:40:23,987
你以前没做过这样的噩梦，现在却有,不奇怪吗？ 
it would be weird if you weren't having nightmares, right?
 

293
00:40:23,989 --> 00:40:25,722
 你有没有想过去看心理医生？
 Have you thought about seeing a shrink?

294
00:40:25,724 --> 00:40:28,425
我看不起             
I can't afford it.

295
00:40:28,427 --> 00:40:30,560
           我意思是如果我有钱  
           I mean, if I had any money at all,

296
00:40:30,562 --> 00:40:31,928
         根本不会回来跟爸爸一起生活
         I wouldn't have come home to live with Dad.

297
00:40:31,930 --> 00:40:34,497
我身无分文                
I'm flat broke.

298
00:40:34,499 --> 00:40:36,132
对了，还有些录影带     
And there are these tapes.

299
00:40:49,547 --> 00:40:53,583
         <i>现在我们知道最后一张卡牌的寓意了 </i>
         <i> Now that we know that's what that last reading meant..</i>
         

300
00:40:53,585 --> 00:40:55,218
            <i>我意思是Moses说的最后一张牌</i>
            <i> I mean, that's what Moses says.</i>

301
00:40:55,220 --> 00:40:57,821
        <i> 我们抽一张新牌</i>
        <i> So, we're gonna get you a new one.</i>

302
00:41:01,792 --> 00:41:04,160
 我真的觉得你不要再看了
 I really don't think you should be watching these anymore.
 

303
00:41:04,162 --> 00:41:06,996
          这肯定是你做噩梦的原因    
         It's no wonder why you're having nightmares.
              

304
00:41:06,998 --> 00:41:08,531
 对你而言没有好处        
It's not good for you.

305
00:41:08,533 --> 00:41:10,500
 如果这是你的妈妈，你会看吗？
 Would you watch them if it was your mom?

306
00:41:10,502 --> 00:41:13,102
 如果这是你唯一了解她的方式？
 Your only chance to get to know her?

307
00:41:13,104 --> 00:41:16,840
 是，我会，但我会等调整好自己生活状态以后再看
 Yeah, I would, but I'd wait, wait until I was recuperated.

308
00:41:16,842 --> 00:41:20,743
     而不是在这个她死掉的房子里看     
     Not when I was still stuck in this house where she died.
          

309
00:41:20,745 --> 00:41:24,013
             我是说你这行为很怪
             I mean,it's just weird.

310
00:41:24,015 --> 00:41:27,183
        而且，她还错得多对得少    
        And besides, she's wrong more than she's right.
            

311
00:41:27,185 --> 00:41:30,053
        她说你不会离开小镇，你爱游泳    
       She said you never left town,you love to swim.
            

312
00:41:30,055 --> 00:41:31,588
         她说了爸爸会死
         She said Dad was gonna die.

313
00:41:31,590 --> 00:41:33,122
           不，她是说你会死
           No, she thought you were gonna die.

314
00:41:33,124 --> 00:41:36,025
             她说了10件事都错了
             She said 10 things that were wrong,

315
00:41:36,027 --> 00:41:39,596
         而你偏偏选一条勉强算是对的来说事
         and you picked one that was almost right.

316
00:41:39,598 --> 00:41:42,165
       Jessie，她没预测你爸爸的死    
       Jessie, she didn't predict your dad's death.
            

317
00:41:42,167 --> 00:41:43,967
              她认为她看见了你的死  
              She thought she  saw your death,

318
00:41:43,969 --> 00:41:45,969
             她所有事都说错了
             and she was wrong about everything.

319
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:51,641
         现在我在想关于你的梦  
         Now, look, I've been thinking  about your dreams.
           

320
00:41:51,643 --> 00:41:55,712
          那个一直出现的女孩，就是你自己
          That girl you keep seeing, it's you.

321
00:41:55,714 --> 00:41:58,181
           那个被烧死的男的  
           And the guy that burnt in the fire,

322
00:41:58,183 --> 00:42:00,884
      应该是你在做那场车祸的噩梦
      you're having a nightmare about your accident.

323
00:42:04,122 --> 00:42:07,090
     妈的，是我老婆，抱歉，我得走了    
     Shit, that's my wife.I'm sorry,but I've gotta go.
         

324

我只是被吓到了 
I just got scared.

378

家里都还正常？ 
Everything okay at home?

00:50:48,780 --> 00:50:51,547
    说“很好”是有点过，但至少我没事

      我不知道，我觉得是有人在那儿     
      I don't know. I think somebody's out there.

00:51:15,539 --> 00:51:17,773
        昨晚那里绝对有人
       There was somebody definitely out there last night.

00:51:17,775 --> 00:51:19,742
        你觉得那条旧船还能用吗？    
       You think that old boat still works?

当然              
Sure.

389
00:51:58,882 --> 00:52:01,484
那到底是什么？  
What is that?


390
00:52:01,486 --> 00:52:04,587
       嗯，好像是巫术一类的东西    
       Mmm. Some kind of voodoo or something.

391
00:52:04,589 --> 00:52:08,424
 我们这区一半的墓地到处都有这种鬼东西    
 Half the cemeteries in this parish are full of that kind of shit.
     

392
00:52:08,426 --> 00:52:10,126
         那他们为什么会放在这儿？   
         But why would they put it on our land?

393
00:52:52,169 --> 00:52:54,937
一定有人来过这里
Yeah, someone's definitely been out here, all right.

394
00:52:59,376 --> 00:53:00,476
而且是不久以前         
That's pretty fresh.

395
00:53:12,423 --> 00:53:13,756
怎么了？     
What?

396
00:53:17,827 --> 00:53:20,462
        下面有东西
        There's something down there.

397
00:53:22,199 --> 00:53:23,332
什么东西？ 
What is that?

398
00:53:25,402 --> 00:53:26,802
 你要干什么？   
What are you doing?

399
00:53:26,804 --> 00:53:28,671
          这不是我第一次下水  
         This isn't my first time in the bayou.

400
00:53:54,864 --> 00:53:57,499
               嗯，这就奇怪了
              Hmm. That's weird.

401
00:54:22,692 --> 00:54:24,627
 那是我的生日           
That's my birthday.

402
00:54:29,699 --> 00:54:32,368
     为什么有人要这样吓你？         
 Why would someone want to spook you like this?
              

403
00:54:37,507 --> 00:54:39,508
           也许那就是个真的墓碑  
           Or maybe that's  a real gravestone.

404
00:54:39,510 --> 00:54:42,978
           也许你有个双胞胎姐妹之类的
           Maybe you had a twin sister or something.

405
00:54:42,980 --> 00:54:47,549
 我从来就没有什么姐妹，就算有为什么她跟我一样的名字？
 I never had a sister.And why would we both have the same name?
 

406
00:54:47,551 --> 00:54:50,919
不知道，我有两个表兄都叫Beauregards   
I don't know.I've got cousins with two Beauregards in their family.
   

407
00:54:52,389 --> 00:54:54,823
 他俩就像名字一样像      
They just like the name.

408
00:54:54,825 --> 00:54:58,927
 但谁杀了鸡？又是谁把花带了过来？
 But who killed that chicken? And who brings flowers?

409
00:55:01,865 --> 00:55:03,599
  你不觉得这墓碑下有东西？
  Do you think there's something under that stone?
 

410
00:55:09,472 --> 00:55:11,707
 好吧                 
 All right.

411 
00:55:11,709 --> 00:55:15,444
回你家看看有什么工具
I guess we'll go back to your house and see what kind of tools you've got.
 

412
00:56:17,407 --> 00:56:18,474
啊             
Uh!

413
00:56:25,949 --> 00:56:29,618
 你完全不知道你父母还有另一个小孩？
 You don't recall any mention of your parents having another little girl?
 

414
00:56:31,588 --> 00:56:32,721
嗯    
Hmm.

415
00:56:34,157 --> 00:56:36,825
           找我们是对的 
           Well, you were right to call us.

416
00:56:38,128 --> 00:56:40,929
 我怀疑这是一个死胎
 I suspect it was a stillbirth.

417
00:56:40,931 --> 00:56:43,031
我们会做相关检测
We'll run some tests,

418
00:56:43,033 --> 00:56:46,168
 
看看他是不是跟你有同样DNA
find out if she was a relative of yours based on your DNA sample.
 

419
00:56:46,170 --> 00:56:50,472
 当然，上次尸检后我们就有了你爸爸的DNA样品
 Of course we have a sample of your daddy already from his autopsy.


420
00:56:50,474 --> 00:56:53,575

找到线索会通知你 
So we'll give you a call when we find out  who this infant was.


421
00:56:53,577 --> 00:56:58,013
  谢谢警官，就知道找你们是对的       
  Thank you, Sheriff. We knew we had to call you right away.

再提醒我一次，你和Laurent小姐的关系 
Remind me again the nature of your relationship  with Miss Laurent.


423
00:57:03,020 --> 00:57:05,087
          我们是高中以来的老朋友 
          We're old friends from high school.

424
00:57:06,990 --> 00:57:09,191
  好了，那么晚安
  Y'all have a good night, then.

425
00:57:10,627 --> 00:57:12,127
谢谢，警官          
Thank you, Sheriff.

426
00:57:18,134 --> 00:57:22,004
        你不能再留在这了吧？
        You know you can't stay here, right?

427
00:57:22,006 --> 00:57:24,106
              我没别的地方去 
             I've got nowhere  else to go.

428
00:57:25,775 --> 00:57:27,576
 不，你有的

00:58:17,795 --> 00:58:19,795
 我得睡了         
I need to get to bed.

439
00:58:19,797 --> 00:58:21,063
谢...         
Thank...

440
00:58:27,237 --> 00:58:29,071
不好意思
I'm sorry about that.

441
00:58:33,209 --> 00:58:35,244
-要打开这个？  -是  
-Undo these.     -Yeah.


442
00:58:41,251 --> 00:58:43,719
-好了        -嗯，谢谢
-Okay, now.  -Yeah, thanks.
          


443
00:58:46,756 --> 00:58:49,291
好了
All right.

444
00:58:49,293 --> 00:58:51,760
  还有什么要帮忙的就跟我说
  Well, just let me know if you need anything else.

445
00:58:54,931 --> 00:58:56,031
 谢谢          
Thank you.

446
00:58:56,966 --> 00:58:58,534
  晚安     
 Night.

447 
00:59:14,817 --> 00:59:17,920
  很抱歉昨晚给你添麻烦了
  I'm sorry for getting you in trouble last night.

448
00:59:17,922 --> 00:59:22,291
没事，老朋友了            
That's all right.  That's what old friends are for.
            

449
00:59:22,293 --> 00:59:26,762
还好，她早上去上班的时候你还在睡     
You're just lucky you were asleep when she left for work this morning.

     
450
00:59:26,764 --> 00:59:28,764
我懂               
I see.

451
00:59:28,766 --> 00:59:31,166
     你为什么要去伍德伯里   
     Yeah. So why do you wanna go to Woodbury?

452
00:59:31,168 --> 00:59:34,169
 我觉得那里应该有人知道那个女婴的来历      
 Well, I think there's somebody who might know  who that baby girl is.
       

453
00:59:34,171 --> 00:59:36,004
  你还记得我们学校的Scott Davis吗？
  Do you remember Scott Davis from school?

454
00:59:36,006 --> 00:59:38,006
恩，我记得      
Yeah, I remember him.

455
00:59:38,008 --> 00:59:42,110
 他的妈妈，在我出生前是我们家厨师       
 His mom, Abbey, used to cook for my mom and dad back before I was born.
        

456
00:59:42,112 --> 00:59:44,880
    明白，我带你过去，希望她还住在那儿
    Well, if she's still alive,I'll take you there.

457
00:59:52,288 --> 00:59:55,057
打扰了，先生，Abigail Davis住这吗？
  Excuse me, sir.Abigail Davis live here?
 

458
00:59:57,260 --> 00:59:58,760
谢谢  
Thank you.

459
01:00:07,670 --> 01:00:08,737
Davis夫人？       
Mrs. Davis?

460
01:00:12,008 --> 01:00:14,142
嘿，Davis夫人？ 
Hey, Mrs. Davis.

461
01:00:14,144 --> 01:00:17,746
 我以前经常和你儿子Scott一起上学
 I used to go to school with your son, Scott.

462
01:00:17,748 --> 01:00:20,349
我是Preston.记得我吗？
  It's Preston.Remember me?

463
01:00:20,351 --> 01:00:22,684
我小时候经常和Scott一起玩 
Me and Scott used to play together when we were little.
 

464
01:00:22,686 --> 01:00:26,321
 你经常骂我们不要顽皮从车库上跳下来，记得吗？
 You used to yell at us for jumping off your garage. Remember?


465
01:00:32,729 --> 01:00:34,229
Preston Saunders.             


466
01:00:36,366 --> 01:00:37,866
你在这摔得要死           
You're gonna break your arm up there,

467
01:00:37,868 --> 01:00:39,101
把我乐坏了             
and I'm gonna laugh my ass off.

468
01:00:42,005 --> 01:00:45,974
很开心又见到你了，Davis夫人，久别了 
It's good to see you, Mrs. Davis.It's been a long time.
 

469
01:00:45,976 --> 01:00:49,411
还有一位来看你.她是Jessie.Jessie Laurent. 
There's someone else here to see you. This is Jessie.Jessie Laurent.
 

470
01:00:49,413 --> 01:00:51,213
 你经常给她做饭
 You used to cook for her folks.

471
01:00:54,250 --> 01:00:55,350
Jessie Laurent?              


472
01:00:55,352 --> 01:00:56,718
嗯         
Mmm-hmm.

473
01:00:59,856 --> 01:01:01,356
                Jessabelle!

474
01:01:15,438 --> 01:01:17,339
Davis夫人         
Mrs. Davis.

475
01:01:21,177 --> 01:01:23,111
天，她还好吗？ 
God, is she all right?

476
01:01:23,113 --> 01:01:24,746
刚她说了些什么？     
What did she say?

477
01:01:24,748 --> 01:01:26,248
不知道    
I don't know.

478
01:01:26,250 --> 01:01:29,751
 她说:"暴雨淋透我们，妈妈"
 She say,"Rain wet us, Mama.

479
01:01:30,887 --> 01:01:32,988
“烈日晒干我们，爸爸" 
"Sun dried us, Papa.

480
01:01:32,990 --> 01:01:35,090
“这个邪恶的背叛者" 
"The betrayers are evil.

481
01:01:35,092 --> 01:01:38,794
“快叫Djowou来对付他们”
"Call down Djowou.
 Call down Djowou
 will deal with them."

482
01:01:38,796 --> 01:01:40,896
是什么意思？              
What's that mean?

483
01:01:40,898 --> 01:01:44,099
   是一首海地的古老歌谣
   It's an old song from Haiti.

484
01:01:44,101 --> 01:01:47,269
让灵魂附身某人才会吟唱 
They sing it to call the spirits to possess someone.
 

485
01:01:50,273 --> 01:01:52,340
  告诉Moses Jessabelle她会得到她应得的！    
  Tell Moses Jessabelle get what's coming to her!

486
01:01:54,845 --> 01:01:56,111
没事吧？
You okay?

487
01:02:07,457 --> 01:02:09,291
这些愚昧的巫术    
Goddamn voodoo shit.

488
01:02:11,494 --> 01:02:13,729
      我一直很讨厌Scott的妈妈
      I always hated Scott's mom.

489
01:02:15,998 --> 01:02:18,767
    Jessie，别担心.她只是一个疯婆子     
   Jessie, don't worry. It's just some crazy old lady.
         

490
01:02:18,769 --> 01:02:21,236
   从头都到尾都在胡言乱语     
   Probably says shit like that all the time.

491
01:02:21,238 --> 01:02:23,772
 “让灵魂附身某人”到底是什么意思？    
 What does that mean "they call the spirits to get possessed"?
      

492
01:02:23,774 --> 01:02:25,440
故意让灵魂附身吗？
On purpose?

493
01:02:25,442 --> 01:02:27,409
  也许在迷信的巫术看来不是件坏事
  Well, yeah.In voodoo, possession ain't a bad thing.
  

494
01:02:28,344 --> 01:02:29,811
什么？                  
What?

495
01:02:29,813 --> 01:02:31,279
 也许是他们仪式的部分内容
 Yeah, it's part of their ceremonies.

496
01:02:31,281 --> 01:02:34,950
 就是他们祈求灵魂附到你身上
 You call down the spirits, and they possess you,

497
01:02:34,952 --> 01:02:36,952
 然后开始跳舞之类的，他们一直那样
 and you dance around.That's what they do.

498
01:02:36,954 --> 01:02:39,488
你怎么知道这些？ 
How do you know that?

499
01:02:39,490 --> 01:02:43,058
得了吧，你也在这长大啊，难道你不知道这里巫术横行？       
Come on You grew up here, too. There's voodoo all around this place.
       

500
01:02:43,060 --> 01:02:45,093
那真的会被附身吗？     
They really get possessed?

501
01:02:45,095 --> 01:02:48,163
 那取决于你问谁.我觉得就是催眠一类的东西
 Well, that depends on who you ask.I think it's like hypnosis.
 

502
01:02:48,165 --> 01:02:50,532
 就像信仰疗法，忽悠人的
 You know,like faith-healing,speaking in tongues.
 

503
01:02:50,534 --> 01:02:52,267
 如果你被忽悠得信了
 If you're raised to believe that,

504
01:02:52,269 --> 01:02:54,002
 就会觉得是真的
 that's what you're gonna think is real.

505
01:02:54,004 --> 01:02:57,139
 加上敲锣打鼓，搞一堆人在旁边跳舞
 Plus they've got drums going,people dancing around.

506
01:02:57,141 --> 01:03:00,408
 再涂点血在你身上.你就会觉得自己被附身了
 They rub blood on you.You think you're possessed.

507
01:03:00,410 --> 01:03:03,512
        "Moses",她说过"去找Moses"
        "Moses".She said, "Tell Moses."

508
01:03:03,514 --> 01:03:07,215
那我就不知道了，巫术混合了很多宗教，天主教，非洲的各种教
I don't know.Voodoo mixes all kinds of religions, Catholic, African.
 

509
01:03:07,217 --> 01:03:08,917
对他们而言都一样 
It's all the same to them.

510
01:03:08,919 --> 01:03:12,420
    不，她说的是我妈妈认识的那个Moses.她在录影带里面提到过 
    No, my mom knew a Moses. She said that on the tape.

511
01:03:12,422 --> 01:03:16,191
    她在教会跟Moses学过塔罗牌    
    She learned tarot cards from Moses at her church.
         

512
01:03:16,193 --> 01:03:18,960
  我觉得教堂就在Jerry's Creek附近      
  I think her church was somewhere out near Jerry's Creek.
         

513
01:03:39,148 --> 01:03:40,282
 妈的                  
God damn it.

514
01:03:42,285 --> 01:03:47,587
好的，你终于有机会见识我的专属大招“真·175度大转弯”了   
Well, I guess you get to see my patented 175-point turn.

515
01:03:47,924 --> 01:03:50,992
 别，等等.那是什么？
 No, wait, wait, wait.What's that?

516
01:04:15,985 --> 01:04:20,422
 "Moses哈勃。生于1952年12月12日
 "Moses Harper.Born December 12th, 1952.

517
01:04:20,424 --> 01:04:22,991
 "死于1988年6月12日"        
"Died June 12th, 1988."

518
01:04:29,999 --> 01:04:34,102
"Legba,开门. Legba,让Moses回来" 
"Legba, open the gate. Legba, let Moses back in."

519
01:04:34,104 --> 01:04:35,570
滚开
Get out.

520
01:04:43,646 --> 01:04:45,914
我是Preston，这是我朋友...
I'm Preston.This here is my friend...

521
01:04:47,617 --> 01:04:49,918
-走吧Preston.         -我们不想惹麻烦          
-Let's go, Preston.  -Look, now, we don't want any trouble.
            

522
01:04:53,323 --> 01:04:54,422
嘿！别这样！               
Hey! Stop it!

523
01:04:58,394 --> 01:04:59,661
等等           
Wait!

524
01:05:01,030 --> 01:05:02,631
- Preston,你还好吗？     - 滚!
- Preston, you all right?- Go!

525
01:05:26,555 --> 01:05:28,023
    你不会是要回来住吧. 
    You're not coming back here.

526
01:05:29,392 --> 01:05:31,192
这不是办法 
Ever. There's no way.

527
01:05:31,194 --> 01:05:32,460
               Preston...

528
01:05:32,462 --> 01:05:34,095
   你不要住在这儿 
   You're not gonna stay here.

529
01:05:36,699 --> 01:05:41,369
进去拿点要用的东西,然后去那我那住 
You go in.Get whatever you need.You can stay with us again.
 

530
01:05:41,371 --> 01:05:43,071
     你老婆会怒的      
     Your wife's gonna be thrilled about that.

531
01:05:46,208 --> 01:05:47,709
     你可以住我妈那儿  
     You could stay at my mom's.

532
01:05:50,079 --> 01:05:53,014
你知道的，我妈一直很喜欢你
My mom always liked you.You know that.
 

533
01:05:55,217 --> 01:05:59,054
 她还留着我们舞会时拍的照片
 She's still got our prom pictures up.

534
01:05:59,056 --> 01:06:01,623
这也就是Sam这么讨厌你的原因 
That's another reason why Sam's so crazy about you.
 

535
01:06:04,060 --> 01:06:07,595
 她知道我心里还有你   
 She knows I still think about you.

536
01:06:12,001 --> 01:06:15,403
 她也知道我们很可能继续走到一起     
 And she knows we're probably gonna move on.
       

537
01:06:15,405 --> 01:06:19,074
 你不必那样做Jessie，只是现在你得做正确的事
 But you didn't do it, Jessie.Not you showing up right now.

538
01:06:19,076 --> 01:06:20,709
 因为现在是非常时期     
 It's just weird timing is all.

539
01:06:37,526 --> 01:06:39,094
 好了，我带你离开这儿
 All right. I'm gonna get you out of here.

540
01:06:42,298 --> 01:06:43,531
好了吗？ 
Ready?

541
01:06:44,467 --> 01:06:45,734
恩                 
Yeah.

542
01:07:10,159 --> 01:07:12,093
恕我       
Excuse me.

543
01:07:17,533 --> 01:07:18,733
好了，我去准备你的行李          
All right,let's get you packed.
          

544
01:07:18,735 --> 01:07:20,101
   你知道袋子在哪吗？ 
   Would you grab me that bag?

545
01:07:20,103 --> 01:07:21,336
恩   
Yeah.

546
01:07:24,807 --> 01:07:26,674
          -给.      -谢谢       
      -Here you go. -Thank you.

547
01:07:28,244 --> 01:07:30,145
 我在旁边等着
 I'll get this over here.

548
01:07:51,634 --> 01:07:53,134
          Preston?

549
01:07:54,770 --> 01:07:58,640
  好了，我们回吧
  All right.Be right back.

550
01:08:17,460 --> 01:08:19,694
-你好了吗？  -好了
-You ready? -All right.

551
01:08:52,228 --> 01:08:53,695
            Preston?

552
01:09:49,451 --> 01:09:50,585
           Preston?

553
01:09:54,256 --> 01:09:55,957
Oh! Preston!

554
01:10:13,509 --> 01:10:15,877
你男朋友被吓到了，但他血压还正常
Your boyfriend is in shock, but his blood pressure is okay.
 

555
01:10:15,879 --> 01:10:17,679
  他应该没事  
  He should be fine when he comes to,

556
01:10:17,681 --> 01:10:20,448
 不过安全起见，还是把他送到了医院  
 but they're running him to the hospital just to be safe.
    

557
01:10:20,450 --> 01:10:24,852
他不是我的男朋友.我们只是高中以来的朋友        
He's not my boyfriend.  We were just friends from high school.
         

558
01:10:24,854 --> 01:10:28,957
 Laurent小姐,你能告诉我到底发生了什么吗？
 Miss Laurent,do you mind telling me what the hell's going on here?
 

559

DNA检测结果还没出来

01:10:55,785 --> 01:10:57,819
 就像人有人把她举起来
 it seems like somebody just picked her up

569
01:10:57,821 --> 01:11:01,022
 然后撞到膝盖上，这过程像是折断一根柴火

什么？          
What?

575
01:11:23,379 --> 01:11:25,480
她再寻求我们的帮助         
She needs our help.
