1
00:00:31,390 --> 00:00:38,908
所以，这个爱尔兰男人，敲了这个女人的门说，有任何工作吗？
So, this Irish guy, knocks on this lady's door and says, ya know, ya got any...any work for me?

00:00:39,158 --> 00:00:44,261
她说，嗯，你知道，事实上，你可以帮我刷门廊的油漆
And she say, Um... well, ya know, as a matter of fact, ya... ya can paint the porch.

3
00:00:48,137 --> 00:00:50,724
大概两小时后，那个男人回来说
About two hours later the guy comes back and says,

4
00:00:50,774 --> 00:00:56,677
「我做完了，女士，只是顺便跟你说，那不是保时捷，是BMW」
(保时捷跟门廊的发音类似)
"I'm finished, Ma'am, but just for your information it's not a Porch, it's a BMW."

5
00:01:03,677 --> 00:01:04,677
圣人文森特

6
00:01:46,018 --> 00:01:49,781
好吧，浑蛋，醒醒
Okay, asshole, giddy up!

7
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:10,791
喔，天啊，我感觉到婴儿在踢，快摸摸看
Oh, my God, feel this, baby's kicking, feel, touch it.

8
00:02:10,841 --> 00:02:13,211
不，不是我的胸，是这裡
No, not my boob, here.

9
00:02:14,461 --> 00:02:16,920
抱歉我们吵醒你了
Sorry we woke you up.

10
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:22,455
就是他，这家伙吵醒你
It was him, this asshole.

11
00:02:31,593 --> 00:02:34,674
- 这是怎样？  - 我现在手头有点紧
- What's this? - I'm a little tight right now.

12
00:02:35,126 --> 00:02:38,269
我不接受分期付款，我不是杰西潘尼百货公司
My shit is not layaway, I'm not J.C. Penny.

13
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:41,538
- 你知道我喜欢小婴儿  - 不，不要想跟以前一样，文森
- You know I'm good for it. - No, don't make like before, Vin.

14
00:02:41,588 --> 00:02:46,207
只有怪胎才喜欢孕妇，我们得替产假预先存钱
Only few freaks like the belly, We have to save for maternity leave.

15
00:02:47,082 --> 00:02:51,545
- 嘿，我喜欢孕妇，好吗？  - 我们下星期二见
- Hey, I like the belly, okay? - I'll see you next Tuesday.

16
00:02:52,269 --> 00:02:55,783
你要加小费，两倍小费
Extras when you do, okay... double.

17
00:02:56,362 --> 00:02:58,953
这裡说明已经冻结了
This one here says the line's frozen.

18
00:02:59,003 --> 00:03:01,806
没错，这些反向抵押贷款，你只能借
Yes, we these reverse mortgages, you can only borrow

19
00:03:01,856 --> 00:03:03,843
你拥有这间房子的产权的百分比
a percentage of the equity you have in the house.

20
00:03:03,893 --> 00:03:05,987
这叫做货款价值
That's call the loan to value.

21
00:03:06,337 --> 00:03:10,163
现在，由于你过去八年，每个月从我们这边获得的
But, now, since you've been getting monthly payments from us for the last...

22
00:03:10,784 --> 00:03:13,533
贷款，你已经达到付款上限
eight years, you've reached the cash out limit.

23
00:03:13,583 --> 00:03:16,152
就是我刚刚跟你说的货款价值
That's that loan to value thing I just mentioned.

24
00:03:16,395 --> 00:03:18,813
- 这房子价值....   - 过去价值...
- The house it worth... - It WAS worth...

25
00:03:19,331 --> 00:03:21,217
不管怎样都是以前的事
whatever it WAS worth.

26
00:03:22,066 --> 00:03:23,375
我需要这笔钱
I need that money.

27
00:03:23,425 --> 00:03:26,877
抱歉，麦肯纳先生，我真的爱莫能助...
I'm sorry, Mr. McKenna, there really nothing I can do...

28
00:03:28,129 --> 00:03:31,593
- 就是这样  - 就是这样？
- It is what it is. - It is what it is?

29
00:03:31,806 --> 00:03:34,538
现在每个人都说这句话，你知道这什麽意思吗？
Now everyone's saying that now, you know what it means?

30
00:03:35,169 --> 00:03:38,287
你完蛋了，而且你就只能完蛋
You're screwed and you shall remain screwed.

31
00:03:58,798 --> 00:04:00,554
我要关闭这个帐户
I wanna close this account.

32
00:04:00,604 --> 00:04:02,673
我很遗憾，先生，我可以问为什麽吗？
So sorry to hear that, Sir, may I ask why?

33
00:04:02,931 --> 00:04:08,402
小姐，你只是一个小齿轮，努力过著像我们一样悲惨
Lady, you're just a spoke on a wheel, tryin' to make a livin' like the rest of us schmucks.

34
00:04:08,452 --> 00:04:11,002
我一点也不想跟你说为什麽，只要...
I do NOT want to tell you to go fuck yourself so, let's...

35
00:04:11,052 --> 00:04:13,691
我要关闭帐户，好吗，就这样，拜託你
I'm closin' it, okay, let's just leave it at that, please.

36
00:04:14,339 --> 00:04:15,595
好的
Okay.

37
00:04:19,931 --> 00:04:22,439
122元又14分
One hundred twelve dollars and fourteen cents.

38
00:04:22,951 --> 00:04:27,617
- 请给我小钞  - 不，先生，那是你透支的金额
- I'd like small bills. - No, Sir, you're overdrawn that much.

39
00:04:27,667 --> 00:04:28,816
这是什麽意思？
What does THAT mean?

40
00:04:28,866 --> 00:04:31,851
你提走的钱比你的帐户裡还要多
You took out more money that you actually have in your account.

41
00:04:31,901 --> 00:04:34,781
这是零元，而你比零元还低
Here's zero, you went below zero.

42
00:04:34,831 --> 00:04:41,152
- 所以我没办法关闭帐户？  - 可以，只要你先让透支归零
- So I CAN'T close this account? - You CAN, once you get it back to zero.

43
00:04:44,827 --> 00:04:46,999
嘿，你过的还好吗？文森
Hey, you takin' care of yourself, Vince?

44
00:04:47,279 --> 00:04:51,915

Yeah, Flurry Eyes, I'm doin' aerobics, can't you tell?

45
00:04:52,208 --> 00:04:59,691
我在做珍芳达式的健身，一、二、三，伸展
I'm doin' the Jane Fonda workout. 1, 2, 3 and stretch.

46
00:04:59,786 --> 00:05:02,788
珍还是很漂亮
Jane is still lookin' good.

47
00:05:02,888 --> 00:05:05,342
罗杰，你能不能倒一杯
Roger, is there any chance you could ever make one of

48
00:05:05,439 --> 00:05:10,173
够烈的酒给某个不是你妹的人？
these that's strong enough for someone that's not... your sister?

49
00:05:10,209 --> 00:05:12,809
- 要不要暂停一下？  - 暂停啥？
- Why don't we give it a break, for a minute. - Give what a break?

50
00:05:13,009 --> 00:05:14,209
倒酒给你

51
00:05:14,609 --> 00:05:19,509
- 你不打算给我倒酒？  - 不要这样，我在注意你
- You're not gonna serve me? - Don't be like that, I'm watchin' out for you here.

52
00:05:19,909 --> 00:05:26,008
你在注意我？你整天替这些什麽都不知道的人灌毒
You watchin' out for me? You serve poison all day to all these people who don't know no better?

53
00:05:26,009 --> 00:05:30,009
让他们死掉你活著？现在你又在注意我了？
So they can die while they're livin'? And you're watchin' out for me?

54
00:05:30,609 --> 00:05:31,809
你这白痴
You're full.

55
00:06:39,109 --> 00:06:40,509
好极了
Nice.

56

闭嘴，有人在睡觉欸
Shut up! People are sleeping!

58
00:08:22,709 --> 00:08:24,209
该死
God damn.

59
00:08:34,209 --> 00:08:36,309
嘿，怎麽一回事？
Hey! What's goin' on?

60
00:08:36,709 --> 00:08:38,209
你们不会说英文吗？
You habla English?

61
00:08:38,809 --> 00:08:42,109
- 我们会说英文，先生  - 那你们在做啥？
- Yes, we speak English, SeÃ±or. - Then what the hell you doing here?

62
00:08:44,109 --> 00:08:48,409
那是我的树，你们两个浑蛋撞坏...我的篱笆
That's MY tree, you assholes hit... and my fence.

63
00:08:50,209 --> 00:08:51,609
还有我的车
My damn car.

64
00:08:51,709 --> 00:08:55,109
- 你们会说英文吗？  - 待在车上
- Do you speak English? - Stay here.

65

00:08:57,809 --> 00:09:01,009
- 我要报警  - 没问题吧
- I'm calling the cops. - Is everybody okay?

67
00:09:01,109 --> 00:09:04,409
- 你要干嘛？  - 我叫玛姬，我是你的新邻居
- What do you want? - I'm Maggie, I'm your new neighbor.

68
00:09:04,509 --> 00:09:05,509
那又怎样？
So?

69
00:09:06,209 --> 00:09:09,109
- 嗯，我们正要搬进来  - 我看的出来
- Well, we're moving in. - I can see that?

70
00:09:10,009 --> 00:09:11,147
这两个王八蛋是你的人吗？
Are these dip-shits with you?

71
00:09:11,261 --> 00:09:14,809
没错，他们是搬家公司的人
Yes, they're the men I hired from the moving company.

72
00:09:16,009 --> 00:09:19,709
- 喔，天啊  - 喔，天啊，不，糟的一蹋糊涂
- Oh, boy. - Oh, boy. no, oh, shit's more like it.

73
00:09:20,009 --> 00:09:26,709
这个篱笆二十年历史了，这台车三十年，这株树比我还老
This fence is 20 years old, the car's 30, the tree is older than I am.

74
00:09:28,609 --> 00:09:34,009
嗯，我很抱歉，我不确定...我，这不是我想要打招呼的方式...
Well, I'm sorry, I'm not sure... well, I'm... this is not how I wanted to meet either...

75
00:09:34,109 --> 00:09:35,509
是你们干的吗？
Did you do this?

76
00:09:35,709 --> 00:09:38,908
当然是他们干的，你是白痴吗，看看犯罪现场
Of course they did it, what are you, stupid, look at the crime scene.

77
00:09:38,909 --> 00:09:40,309
你不需要这麽不礼貌
You don't have to be rude to me.

78
00:09:40,409 --> 00:09:44,809
我才刚搬到这裡，我请人搬家，然后意外发生
I'm just trying to move in here, I hired these guys to do it, and accidents happen.

79
00:09:47,609 --> 00:09:52,209
- 哼，这台车是骨董了，小姐，价值不少钱  - 我会解决
- Well, the car's an antique, missy, it's worth a lot. - And I'll take care of it.

80
00:09:52,909 --> 00:09:57,809
你？你连钱都没有，怎样，我是说，不要介意，但你看起来一点钱也没有
You? You don't got no money, what, I mean, no offense, but you just don't look like you do.

81
00:09:58,309 --> 00:10:01,509
好吗，我也确定拉丁仔跟那家伙也没有钱
Okay, I'm sure Chico and the man here are off the books.

82
00:10:01,609 --> 00:10:04,009
不，我会告搬家公司
No, I will sue the moving company.

83
00:10:05,209 --> 00:10:07,809
你可以处理篱笆跟树
You can buck-up for the fence... and the tree.

84
00:10:10,709 --> 00:10:11,709
好吧
Fine.

85
00:10:14,309 --> 00:10:15,709
一群智障
Toodles.

86

- 这就是我们的新邻居？  - 没错
- Is that our new a neighbor? - Yep.

87
00:10:18,909 --> 00:10:20,709
看样子要过得很痛苦了
It's gonna be a long life.

88
00:10:22,209 --> 00:10:25,749
「好吧，说说这树，她儘可能地挺起身子」
"Well, said the tree.", she straightened herself up as much as much as she could"

89
00:10:25,799 --> 00:10:28,409
「这树桩适合坐下休息」
"well, now the stump is good for sitting and resting."

90
00:10:28,609 --> 00:10:35,609
「来吧，男孩，坐下，坐下休息」那男孩坐下，而树感到开心
"Come, boy, sit down, sit down and rest." And the boy did and the tree was happy.

91
00:10:36,009 --> 00:10:38,809
- 天啊，真无聊  - 不，这不会...
- God, that's depressing. - No, it's not...

92
00:10:38,909 --> 00:10:41,909
树做出了奉献，能够给予一切
The tree was made to give, so, to be able to give everything

93
00:10:41,959 --> 00:10:45,009
直到一无所有，是他最好的人生
and have nothing left is the best life she could ever have.

94
00:10:46,109 --> 00:10:48,709
嗯，你爸一定也认为我是株树
Well, your father must think I'm a tree.

95
00:10:48,809 --> 00:10:50,609
- 你怎麽会想到...   - 没事，没事
- How do you think... - Nothin', nothin'.

96
00:10:50,709 --> 00:10:55,209
你想到正面就是好事，来吧，上床吧
It's good ya think good things. C'mon, get in there.

97
00:10:56,309 --> 00:10:58,908
- 明天很重要  - 嗯，我知道，上学第一天
- Big day tomorrow. - Yeah, I know, first day.

98
00:10:58,909 --> 00:11:01,909
嗯，我也是，而且我不能迟到
Yeah, for me, too and I can't be late.

99
00:11:02,009 --> 00:11:04,609
- 好吗，只剩你跟我了  - 我知道
- All right, it's just you and me now. - I know.

100
00:11:04,709 --> 00:11:07,708
设好闹钟确保我不会睡过头
Set the alarm and make sure I don't oversleep.

101

晚安

谢谢，妈

Wait, Ma, you're not gonna pick me up or anything?

112
00:11:31,109 --> 00:11:34,209
我挡到公车了，我可不想接到罚单，奥利佛，再见，乖一点
I'm in the bus lane, I'm not gonna get another ticket, Oliver... bye... be good.

113
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:52,209
圣派翠克小学

好吧，有点吵，有点吵，安静下来，安静下来
Okay, a little loud, a little loud, settle down, settle down, settle down.

115
00:12:16,109 --> 00:12:22,408
我知道你们很难控制自己，尤其你们还这麽小又喝了一堆果汁
I know it's hard to contain yourselves when you're so, so young and full of sugar juice.

116
00:12:22,409 --> 00:12:27,608
但我们一定要专心在课业上，要不然呢，我们会笨死，没错
But we must concentrate on our studies or we will what? We will die dumb, yes, we will.

117
00:12:27,609 --> 00:12:30,109
愚笨在天堂不是好事
And dumbness does not play well in Heaven.

Maybe as a thank you, you can lead us all in morning prayer.

122
00:12:58,209 --> 00:13:03,709
- 我想....我是犹太人   - 好吧，知道了
- I think... I think I'm Jewish. - Okay, good to know.

123
00:13:05,309 --> 00:13:08,408
- 奥利佛认为他是犹太人  - 我也是

124
00:13:08,409 --> 00:13:10,209

- I'm Buddhist. - There is no God.

125
00:13:12,309 --> 00:13:16,909
你了解了吧，这裡我们接受全世界所有宗教，奥利佛
Yeah, you get the idea, we celebrate all the religions of the world in this room, Oliver.

126
00:13:17,209 --> 00:13:22,609
我是天主教徒，也是最好的宗教，真的，因为我们的规矩最多
I'm a Catholic, which is the best of all the religions, really, because we have the most rules.

127
00:13:23,109 --> 00:13:24,408
制服也最好看

But among us, there's also a Buddhist, agnostic, we have a Baptist,

129
00:13:29,409 --> 00:13:34,008
我们也有「我不知道」教，似乎是世界上成长最快的宗教
and we have a I-Don't-Know, which seems to be the fastest growing religion in the world.

130
00:13:34,009 --> 00:13:39,509
现在我们有「我想我是犹太人」教，这裡最新的一位，奥利佛，感谢你
And now we have I-Think-I'm-Jewish. which is a new one for the class, Oliver, so thanks for that.

131
00:13:39,909 --> 00:13:43,810
但这不妨碍你替我们做晨祷
But it does not preclude you from giving us a morning prayer.

132
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:45,909
大家低头祷告
Let us bow our heads and pray.

133

- 亲爱的...  - 神...之类的

嗯，他就住在隔壁，你也找不到更近的了
Well, he lives right next door, you can't get closer than that.

你会在家吧？

I'm the one that has to work now, your father's not helping.

254
00:25:42,109 --> 00:25:44,909

I don't know if he's ever going to, your school's not exactly cheap.

I guess he's too old to be dangerous, not too old to be too dangerous, either, if you know what I mean.

What the word? Discrimination against pregnant woman, yes?

261

我想你有很好的机会告赢

- But they have technology. - Yeah, I know what they have.

267
00:26:58,409 --> 00:27:03,208
也许我可以打电话给脱衣舞老板给我健保卡让我去做超音波
But, maybe I call stripper employer and ask them to fax insurance card to pay ultrasound?

268
00:27:03,209 --> 00:27:04,209

It's one of the more honest ways to make a living.

442
00:44:05,009 --> 00:44:11,608

00:44:31,909 --> 00:44:35,808
对马来说不好，牠的赔率跟天文数字一样
Not for a horse,  the odds of him winning are astronomical.

449
00:44:35,809 --> 00:44:39,476

什麽叫三连胜？
What's a trifecta?

454
00:45:02,409 --> 00:45:07,009
你选三头马，按照一、二、三顺序完成比赛
You pick three horses, 1, 2, 3 in the order they finish.

455
00:45:08,009 --> 00:45:11,409

- High risk and reward. - Sounds improbable.

456

462
00:45:38,309 --> 00:45:41,009
那你可能会学得很痛苦
Well, you might as well learn the hard way.

463
00:45:41,609 --> 00:45:44,509
我也下点钱，减轻你的痛苦
I'll throw in some too, that's called mitigation.

464
00:45:46,209 --> 00:45:50,909
- 什麽减轻？  - 你下七块钱，我下三块
- What's "mitigation"? - That's where you throw in 7, and I throw in 3.

Do not stop! Don't stop! Don't stop! Don't stop!

468
00:46:33,809 --> 00:46:37,308
这真不公平，不公平
It isn't fair! It's not fair!

469
00:46:37,309 --> 00:46:38,345
我们赢了，是吗？
We won... didn't we?

470
00:46:38,370 --> 00:46:43,109
不要说出来，不要说出来，假装你没赢
Just roll with it, just roll with it, man, just roll with it, like you didn't win it.

471
00:46:43,509 --> 00:46:47,109
- 该死  - 不，不会吧，又没赢
- Shot! - No! No! It didn't work for me.

472
00:46:47,209 --> 00:46:53,109
你知道吗？我们没赢，我们一毛钱都没有
Do you understand me? We... we didn't win at all, we didn't win anything, okay?

473
00:47:42,409 --> 00:47:46,008
午安，麦肯纳先生
Good afternoon. Mr. McKenna.

474
00:47:46,009 --> 00:47:49,209
我要替我孙子开一个帐户
I need to open up a savings account for grandson.

475
00:47:49,909 --> 00:47:55,135
这是让我的帐户归零的钱，顺便替我关闭我的帐户
And this'll get my account up to zero. Close me out while you're tapping away over there.

476
00:47:56,209 --> 00:48:00,344
以后不要当会计师，他们没有骨气
Don't ever become a pencil-pusher, kid, they're spineless.

477
00:48:39,609 --> 00:48:45,609
你好，布朗女士，我是丹欧布莱恩，圣派翠克小学的校长
Hello, Mrs. Bronstein, this is Dan O'Brien, Principal here at St. Patrick.

478
00:48:47,009 --> 00:48:52,809
几天前，你的儿子奥利佛在学校打架
A few days ago, your son Oliver was involved in a fight at school.

479
00:48:53,309 --> 00:48:55,609
- 我们一直想连络你  - 什麽？
- We tried to reach you... - What?

480
00:48:57,809 --> 00:49:02,009
如果你是推销员，请留言，这样我就不需要打给你
If you're a telemarketer, please leave a message so I can NOT return your call.

481
00:49:03,197 --> 00:49:12,009
文？文？奥利佛？奥利佛？我是妈，快接电话
Vin? Vin? Oliver? Oliver, it's Mom, pick up. Hello?

482
00:49:16,309 --> 00:49:19,209
- 你还想喝吗？  - 嗯，麻烦了
- You want another? - Yes, please.

483
00:49:19,609 --> 00:49:22,209
你自己叫吧，我们今天要开心一点
Go for it, we're livin' today.

484
00:49:24,009 --> 00:49:29,109
- 不好意思，先生  - 你蠢孩子
- Excuse me, Sir. - You kids, pimp small-talkers.

485
00:49:29,209 --> 00:49:31,908
你要是不大叫，没人听的到
There's no point in yappin', 'cause no one's listenin'

486
00:49:31,909 --> 00:49:35,608
- 再来一次  - 不好意思，先生
- Let's hear it. - Excuse me, Sir!!

487
00:49:35,609 --> 00:49:38,709
要是没听到就什麽都没有
Ya can't get nothin' in this world without bein' heard.

488
00:49:40,109 --> 00:49:43,309
- 再来一杯可乐，谢谢  - 也再给我来一杯，罗杰
- Another coke, please. - You can hit me, too, Rog.

489
00:49:43,509 --> 00:49:47,209
你的波本酒卖光了，你把我喝光了
We're out of your bourbon, ya cleaned me out.

490
00:49:49,909 --> 00:49:55,209
- 不要骗我，像个男人  - 文，他根本不能进来酒吧
- Don't lie to me, be a man. - Vin! And he's not supposed to be sittin' at the bar.

491
00:49:55,909 --> 00:49:59,208
你说的对，我们得找其他地方花光钱
You're right, we're gonna go somewhere else to spend our money.

492
00:49:59,209 --> 00:50:03,809
嘿，他只是在做他的工作，好心一点
Hey, he's only doin' his job, Dead Man, be nice.

493
00:50:05,409 --> 00:50:06,809
该死
Damn.

494
00:50:08,409 --> 00:50:13,109
- 安珀，拿急救箱  - 只是割到手，我常这样
- Amber, get the first aid kit. - It's just a cut, I got lots of 'em.

495
00:50:13,159 --> 00:50:14,570
来，给你
Yeah, here.

496
00:50:16,309 --> 00:50:20,149
- 你的血沾到吧檯了  - 没关系，小孩子得做作业了
- You're bleedin' all over the bar. - That's fine, kid's gotta do homework.

497
00:50:20,817 --> 00:50:22,434
来吧，我们走了
Come on, let's go.

498
00:50:47,309 --> 00:50:48,598
海，妈
Hi, Mom.

499
00:50:48,609 --> 00:50:52,009
- 你去哪裡了，你的车呢？文  - 坏掉了
- Where were you, where the hell's your car, Vin? - It broke down.

500
00:50:52,109 --> 00:50:55,109
- 坏掉了  - 喔，坏掉了，真的吗？
- It broke down. - Oh, it broke down, really!

501
00:50:55,309 --> 00:50:59,309
我不喜欢你没问过我就带他乱走
I don't appreciate you taking him anywhere without asking me.

502
00:50:59,509 --> 00:51:03,809
- 哇，真有趣  - 你可不可以放聪明一点，好吗
- Whoa, this is gonna be fun. - Can you not be a smart-ass, just for once, okay?

503
00:51:03,909 --> 00:51:07,409
我要知道我儿子的行踪，好吗？
I want to know where my son is at all times, okay?

504
00:51:07,459 --> 00:51:09,858
- 我们去吃东西  - 要让他挨饿吗？
- We just went to eat. - He should starve?

505
00:51:10,409 --> 00:51:11,682
进去，奥利佛
Go in the house, Oliver.

506
00:51:11,785 --> 00:51:13,576
- 妈  - 进去，奥利佛
- Mom. - Go in the house, Oliver

507
00:51:15,809 --> 00:51:18,709
- 晚安，文  - 嗯，我们明天见
- Good night, Vin. - Yeah, we'll see about that.

508
00:51:19,809 --> 00:51:22,213
你知道他在学校打架吗？
You know he's getting into fights at school, did you know that?

509
00:51:22,263 --> 00:51:24,008
嗯，他有提过
Yeah, he mentioned something like that.

510
00:51:24,009 --> 00:51:26,027
是吗，他并没有跟我说过这件事
Yeah, well, he didn't mention anything to me about it.

511
00:51:26,078 --> 00:51:29,809
喔，也许你不知道，但因为你不常在家
Oh, well, maybe you haven't noticed, but you haven't been home much.

512
00:51:29,909 --> 00:51:33,119
跟一个不常在家的人有点难沟通
It's kinda difficult to have a conversation with someone that's not here.

513
00:51:33,131 --> 00:51:34,809
喔，我们要这样吗？
Oh, we're going to do that?

514
00:51:35,109 --> 00:51:38,909
天啊，我最喜欢像你这种人给我建议，特别是为人父母
God, I love when somebody like you tells somebody like me advice, especially on parenting.

515
00:51:39,109 --> 00:51:43,009
我的服务不包含被你骂，所以我要加到一小时十五块
I didn't sign on for the hormones, deary, so that's gonna cost you 15 bucks an hour.

516
00:51:43,109 --> 00:51:44,802
你知道你为什麽没小孩吗？
You know why you never had kids?

517
00:51:45,052 --> 00:51:48,209
因为你从不为别人著想只想到你自己
Because you don't want to think about anybody other than yourself.

518
00:51:48,809 --> 00:51:54,109
你又知道我什麽？说真的，跟我说啊
What do you know about me? Really? Tell me, I'd love it.

519
00:51:55,109 --> 00:51:57,502
没有，我一点都不知道你，就像你想的那样
Nothing, I don't know a thing about you, just the way you want it,

520
00:51:57,595 --> 00:52:01,109
你可以继续像个浑蛋让大家都远离你
and then you can act like a prick and it keeps everybody away.

521
00:52:02,309 --> 00:52:06,209
- 「如果没有打断...」 - 已经打断了，文，你自己看看
- "If it ain't broken..." - It is broken, Vin, take a look at it.

522
00:52:06,309 --> 00:52:10,509
喔，好吧，那我这星期工作40小时，或是41小时，超过半小时算一小时
Oh, all right, I'm at forty hours for this week, at forty-one I go to time and a half.

523
00:52:13,409 --> 00:52:16,009
不好意思，有人能付我钱吗？
Excuse me, someone gonna pay me?

524
00:52:17,909 --> 00:52:19,809
开什麽玩笑啊
You gotta be kidding me.

525
00:52:22,809 --> 00:52:26,709
- 我根本说不出这些词  - 其实很有创意
- I can't even say these words. - They're creative.

526
00:52:29,009 --> 00:52:31,009
他一口气说的
That's one way to put it.

527
00:52:31,209 --> 00:52:38,022
在他这个年纪换到新学校都很难熬，或是任何年纪
Adjusting to a new school is tough on children at this age, at any age, really, and I don't

528
00:52:38,072 --> 00:52:45,326
我不想特别指什麽，但有没有任何我们需要注意的事？
want to minimize that...but is there anything else going on that we should be aware of?

529
00:52:45,409 --> 00:52:49,709
- 喔，我根本不晓得从哪裡开始讲  - 他的父亲呢？
- Oh, I wouldn't even know where to start. - How about his father?

530
00:52:49,809 --> 00:52:54,409
- 嗯，我不想浪费你们的时间  - 我们有很多时间
- Well, I don't want to take up all your time. - We have all the time.

531
00:52:57,709 --> 00:53:00,409
我们正在办离婚
We're in the middle of a divorce.

532
00:53:00,509 --> 00:53:05,809
奥利佛的父亲跟他的助理有外遇，还有会计
Oliver's father was having an affair with his assistant, and their accountant,

533
00:53:06,109 --> 00:53:10,708
还有我的髮型设计师，她还是替我弄头髮，很有趣
And my hairdresser, while she was still doing my hair, so that was fun.

534
00:53:10,709 --> 00:53:14,909
现在他想要奥利佛的监护权，全部的监护权
And now he's filed for custody for Oliver... full custody

535
00:53:15,009 --> 00:53:17,808
他在得到想要的东西之前不会给任何援助
and he won't pay any support until he gets what he wants.

536
00:53:17,809 --> 00:53:19,909
- 还有，他是律师  - 该死
- Plus, he's a lawyer. - Shit.

537
00:53:20,009 --> 00:53:24,309
所以我只能儘可能带著奥利佛离开的越快越好
So, I just had to get out of there as fast as I could and I took Oliver with me.

538
00:53:24,609 --> 00:53:32,509
我在密西丘找到工作，我是断层扫描工程师，所以我每天工作都很忙
And I got a job at Mission Hills, I'm a C.A.T. scan tech, so I just see really rough stuff all day.

539
00:53:33,109 --> 00:53:39,609
你知道，我每天都在看癌症、肿瘤、囊肿和血块，但我不能说
You know, cancer and tumors and cysts and clots and I see what I'm looking at but I can't tell

540
00:53:39,909 --> 00:53:44,508
其他人都依靠我，所以我每天都很悲惨
you know, the people that are laying there, so, that's miserable all day,

541
00:53:44,509 --> 00:53:50,609
我每天都工作到很晚，因为我想公私分明
and I work really late, because I'm trying to get our act together.

542
00:53:52,709 --> 00:53:56,009
这就是他在这裡的原因，因为他可以受到良好教育
That's why he's here, so he can have a good education.

543
00:53:56,109 --> 00:54:02,809
我想要让奥利佛过的正常一点，但我却要处理大卫的事，还有...
And I'm trying to give him a semi-normal life, and I'm dealing with this shit from David, and...

544
00:54:04,409 --> 00:54:06,909
我真的很抱歉他说葬话
I'm really am sorry about swearing.

545
00:54:09,209 --> 00:54:14,209
我知道他不想要生小孩，他根本不想要奥利佛
I know he didn't even want kids... he didn't want him.

546
00:54:14,409 --> 00:54:19,508
他只是想这麽做让我不开心，你知道奥利佛是被领养的吗？你们知道吗？
He's just doing this so I'm not happy. You know Oliver's adopted? Did you know that?

547
00:54:19,509 --> 00:54:22,809
我不知道你们会怎麽做....但他...
I don't know how you would be... he is, and...

548
00:54:24,109 --> 00:54:27,208
我生不出小孩
I cannot have kids.

549
00:54:27,209 --> 00:54:30,775
你知道，我的输卵管打结...我想...
You know, something about my fallopian tubes being twisted... I think...

550
00:54:30,825 --> 00:54:35,609
我认为我的身体在反抗大卫的精虫
what I REALLY think is that they were just recoiling from David's sperm.

551
00:54:37,209 --> 00:54:41,709
我....可以...给我一张...谢谢
I... can... just have one... thank you.

552
00:54:42,209 --> 00:54:45,892
所以，嗯，我经历了这麽多事
So, uh... to think that all of this has permeated,

553
00:54:45,942 --> 00:54:50,409
你知道，奥利佛的小事，我是说...
you know, Oliver's whole, little being, right? I mean...

554
00:54:50,459 --> 00:54:54,190
一定得，他就像是小...小海绵一样
it'd have to, he's like a little... like a little sponge.

555
00:54:54,609 --> 00:54:58,209
我的真名叫罗伯特，奥兹是我的姓
My real name's Robert, Ozinski's my last name.

556
00:54:59,309 --> 00:55:04,609
从去年盖瑞叫我之后大家都开始这样叫
People called me that ever since Gary called me that last year, now everyone calls me that.

557
00:55:05,509 --> 00:55:07,008
我根本没办法说
We can't go around 'em:

558
00:55:07,009 --> 00:55:11,509
「嘿，蠢蛋们，不要叫我奥兹，我叫罗伯特」
"Hey, Dubois, don't call me Ozinski, my name's Robert."

559
00:55:12,609 --> 00:55:15,009
现在我却要花上整天做这些事
Now I spend my whole life doin' that.

560
00:55:15,309 --> 00:55:18,509
- 你在尿尿？  - 抱歉，我忍不住
- You takin' a whiz? - Sorry, can't hold it.

561
00:55:19,509 --> 00:55:23,809
罗伯特是我霸的名字，我是二世
Robert was my dad's name, I'm a Junior.

562
00:55:23,909 --> 00:55:28,409
他不在我身边，我其实也不认识他，他在我还是婴儿的时候就离开了
He's not around, though, I don't really know him 'cause he left when I was a baby.

563
00:55:29,409 --> 00:55:32,792
嗯，我爸也不在我身边，他对我妈做了些坏事
Yeah, my dad's not around either, he did some bad things

564
00:55:32,842 --> 00:55:35,948
所以我们离开他，我已经有段时间没看到他了
to my mom and so we left and I haven't seen him in a while.

565
00:55:38,409 --> 00:55:42,209
我有点想他，我妈有点坏
I kinda miss him, though, my Mom's being a jerk.

566
00:55:43,009 --> 00:55:44,809
他们都是这样，老兄
They do that, man.

567
00:55:59,209 --> 00:56:04,009
- 你爸教你怎麽打架的吗？  - 不，是我的保母
- Your dad the one that taught ya how ta fight? - No, my babysitter.

568
00:56:05,509 --> 00:56:09,009
一天会涨潮两次，医生
The tide comes in twice a day, Doctor.

569
00:56:09,209 --> 00:56:12,609
嗯，潮汐就是这样，涨潮退潮
Yeah, that's a tide, comes and goes.

570
00:56:13,909 --> 00:56:19,644
我等不及秋天到来，水边种满了最漂亮的菊花
I can't wait for Autumn, they plant the most beautiful mums all around the water.

571
00:56:20,109 --> 00:56:24,609
变成所有你想像的到的颜色，我不知道怎麽会这样
Every color you can imagine. I don't know where they get them all.

572
00:56:26,109 --> 00:56:27,809
去植物园买的吧
At the garden store.

573
00:56:30,509 --> 00:56:33,009
你总是很幽默，文
You've always been so funny, Vin.

574
00:56:35,109 --> 00:56:36,109
文
Vin.

575
00:56:37,009 --> 00:56:39,209
文，就是文，珊蒂
Vin, it's Vin, Sandy.

576
00:56:43,809 --> 00:56:45,608
鸭子会吃掉植物
The ducks eat them, though.

577
00:56:45,609 --> 00:56:50,009
我们得赶走鸭子，很可惜
We have to shoo them away, it such a shame.

578
00:56:53,109 --> 00:56:54,809
很可惜
It's a shame.

579
00:57:00,809 --> 00:57:03,409
我们有很多种你可负担的照顾选择，文
There's plenty of affordable health care options, Vin.

580
00:57:03,709 --> 00:57:09,341
我想你也知道，阳光居的价格不是人人都负担的起
I'm sure you know that, Sunnyside is pricey, not for everyone.

581
00:57:12,409 --> 00:57:15,909
珊蒂得受到最好的照顾，我只是，我还在想办法
My Sandy gets the best, I just... I'll just have to figure it out.

582
00:57:16,009 --> 00:57:20,209
我了解，但你已经拖延几个月了，我们不是做慈善事业，你也知道
I understand that, but you're months behind and we are not in the credit business, as you know.

583
00:57:21,009 --> 00:57:22,009
什麽意思？
What's that mean?

584
00:57:22,509 --> 00:57:26,709
我们需要预先付三个月的全额
We need payment in full and three months in advance.

585
00:57:26,909 --> 00:57:29,109
- 了解  - 下星期前
- Got it. - By next week.

586
00:57:29,309 --> 00:57:31,909
- 下星期？ - 嗯，下星期
- Next week? - Yeah, next week.

587
00:57:35,209 --> 00:57:40,308
嗯，我可以先付20%，够诚恳了吧
Well, I can give you 20 percent. In good faith?

588
00:57:40,309 --> 00:57:43,109
文，好意心领了，抱歉
Vin, we're passed good faith, I'm sorry.

589
00:57:43,709 --> 00:57:46,709
我们会将珊蒂转院到其他你需要的地方
We will transfer Sandy wherever you want to put her.

590
00:57:47,109 --> 00:57:48,509
转院？
Put her?

591
00:57:48,909 --> 00:57:51,409
就这样？
That's it? Or we get the boot?

592
00:57:51,809 --> 00:57:54,886
我想这不算是最好的说法
I don't think that's the best way to phrase what's happening.

593
00:57:54,995 --> 00:57:58,009
好吧，那更好的说法是什麽？
Okay, what's the best way to phrase it?

594
00:57:58,709 --> 00:58:00,709
就是这样
It is what it is.

595
00:58:03,109 --> 00:58:07,609
- 可以在她的房间摆些新植物吗？  - 我可以加订一些
- Let's get some new plants for the room, okay? - I can have the desk order somethin'.

596
00:58:08,109 --> 00:58:12,009
- 嗯，我想要放菊花  - 没问题
- Well, I was hopin' maybe for mums. - Sure.

597
00:58:13,009 --> 00:58:15,499
还有，这是给你添麻烦的小费
And ah... here's a little somethin' for your trouble.

598
00:58:15,509 --> 00:58:18,808
不行，文，这本来就是我的工作，我照顾每个人，不要这样
No! Vin! This is my job, I take care of people, please.

599
00:58:18,809 --> 00:58:23,609
你做超过你的工作了，安娜，你就像珊蒂的天使
You go WAY beyond your job, Anna, you've been an angel to my Sandy.

600
00:58:24,409 --> 00:58:28,609
- 好吧，文，但以后不要这样，好吗？  - 也不会，我破产了
- Okay, Vin, we don't make it habit now, okay? - It can't happen, I'm shit broke.

601
00:58:31,109 --> 00:58:35,909
你的微笑很美，你应该多笑意点，我去拿衣服
Ya got a nice smile, ya should do it more often. I'll get the laundry.

602
00:58:52,609 --> 00:58:53,909
给你
There ya go.

603
00:58:57,209 --> 00:59:01,209
- 少了很多  - 她这星期不太换衣服
- It's a lot lighter. - She didn't change much this week.

604
00:59:02,569 --> 00:59:05,709
嗯，我的车会轻一点
Well... easy on my back.

605
00:59:06,809 --> 00:59:10,009
- 谢谢  - 你自己小心，文
- Thanks. - Behave yourself, Vin.

606
00:59:21,809 --> 00:59:23,166
他愿意付一百元
He'll pay hundred dollars.

607
00:59:23,216 --> 00:59:26,609
一百元，我拿处方籤花的还更多
A hundred dollars, I pay more than that for one prescription.

608
00:59:26,909 --> 00:59:33,709
他说，这是治疗癫痫，前列腺烧灼还有软便
He said, this is for epilepsy, for prostate flaring and to soften the shitting.

609
00:59:34,409 --> 00:59:37,409
- 这还是有点价值啊 - 给谁用啊？你吗？
- That should add some value. - For who? You?

610
00:59:39,209 --> 00:59:43,409
我们需要，我需要...五百元
We need the... I need the dough. I... 500 bucks!

611
00:59:43,909 --> 00:59:47,308
- 这都是高价值的垃圾  - 他说一百元，文
- This is all high-dollar shit. - He said one hundred, Vin.

612
00:59:47,309 --> 00:59:50,709
接受或是离开，你也不能当毒品卖
You take it or leave it, you can't sell this to get high.

613
00:59:53,009 --> 00:59:54,609
我愿意拿一百块
I'll take the hundred.

614
00:59:57,209 --> 00:59:59,809
喔，你愿意拿一百块，蠢蛋
Oh, you take the hundred. Stupid.

615
01:00:17,209 --> 01:00:20,109
- 你的帐户已经关闭了，麦肯纳先生  - 是，我知道
- Your account's closed, Mr. McKenna. - Yeah, I know that.

616
01:00:20,309 --> 01:00:24,109
这次我要结清我孙子的帐户，我想我有资格
This withdraw is on my grandson's account, I think I'm on it.

617
01:00:26,309 --> 01:00:29,309
- 你要多少？先生  - 总共多少？
- How much, Sir? - What's the balance?

618
01:00:32,409 --> 01:00:34,209
2700元
Twenty-seven hundred.

619
01:00:39,509 --> 01:00:42,509
- 我全部都要  - 你要拿大钞还是小钞
- I'll take all of it. - How'd you like that?

620
01:00:42,809 --> 01:00:44,009
一百元钞票，谢谢
Hundreds, please.

621
01:00:49,909 --> 01:00:51,575
这是2700元，赖瑞
It's twenty-seven hundred, Larry,

622
01:00:51,625 --> 01:00:55,209
我要买450元的第三场的三连胜
I want a four hundred and fifty dollar trifecta box in the third, okay.

623
01:00:55,309 --> 01:01:00,709
一、二、三，幸运林肯，新黛咪，山米的储蓄
One, two, three. Lucky Lincoln, New Dime, Sammy's Saving.

624
01:01:02,109 --> 01:01:03,011
谢谢你
Thank you, Sir.

625
01:01:03,061 --> 01:01:05,354
- 这次会让一切翻转  - 好的
- This is gonna make it all better. - Okay.

626
01:01:36,609 --> 01:01:38,409
你还好吗？
You all right, hon?

627
01:01:40,309 --> 01:01:41,609
不，我不好
No, I'm not.

628
01:02:40,409 --> 01:02:43,909
你一定认为我不是认真的人，文尼
You must think I'm not a very serious person, Vinny.

629
01:02:45,009 --> 01:02:48,209
- 你没资格来这裡  - 你找到什麽值钱的东西吗？
- You have no right to be here! - You find anything good?

630
01:02:48,309 --> 01:02:51,409
不，只有些旧珠宝，不值多少钱
Naw, some old jewelry, not worth much.

631
01:02:51,509 --> 01:02:56,312
- 那是我妻子的东西，你这浑蛋  - 你欠我钱
- That's my wife's, you son of a bitch. - You owe me money.

632
01:02:59,909 --> 01:03:05,009
拜託，文尼，为什麽你一定要让事情这麽难做
Come on, Vinny! Why do you always have to do things the hard way?

633
01:03:05,309 --> 01:03:08,409
- 这样比较有趣  - 你会很痛苦
- It's more interesting. - And a lot more painful.

634
01:03:08,609 --> 01:03:12,309
好吧，来吧
All right, let's do.

635
01:03:12,509 --> 01:03:17,909
- 这家伙疯了  - 别杀了他，但让他生不如死
- This son of a bitch is crazy. - Don't kill him, but bring him close to it.

636
01:03:20,109 --> 01:03:21,409
怎麽...？
What the...?

637
01:03:25,209 --> 01:03:28,909
- 你在干嘛？老头  - 他要死了，老兄
- What are you doing, old man? - He's dyin', boo.

638
01:03:29,109 --> 01:03:31,309
不，他不会，他...
No he's not, he's...

639
01:03:39,809 --> 01:03:42,409
不要碰任何东西，我们走吧
Don't touch nothin', let's just go.

640
01:04:35,509 --> 01:04:39,957
文，我是麦姬，我们要把你放进仪器哩，我们要做些测试
Vin, it's Maggie, we're gonna put you in this machine, and we're gonna take some tests

641
01:04:40,009 --> 01:04:43,809
- 这不会痛   - 他根本听不到，玛姬
- and it's not gonna hurt a bit. - He can't understand you, Maggie.

642
01:04:45,909 --> 01:04:50,209
好吧，就这样，就这样，这要花上几分钟
Okay, there he is, there he is, okay, it's just gonna be a couple of minutes.

643
01:05:13,109 --> 01:05:16,508
- 我勇敢的小家伙  - 他还好吗？
- There's my brave, little man. - Is he okay?

644
01:05:16,509 --> 01:05:18,309
我以为他死了
I thought he was dead.

645
01:05:19,209 --> 01:05:22,409
- 他飞上天堂了  - 嗯，看起来很像
- He's flyin', then. - Yeah, that's what it looks like.

646
01:05:23,109 --> 01:05:28,309
- 他看起来也很像喝醉了   - 我不想知道你们在做什麽
- He looks like that when he's drunk, too, so... - I don't even know what you're doin' anymore.

647
01:05:28,609 --> 01:05:32,109
我只知道我在做什麽，你爸明天会在法院上大做文章
I know what I'm doin', your father's gonna have a field day with this.

648
01:05:32,309 --> 01:05:35,509
我...我要不是因为你也不会这样槓上他，我要...
I wouldn't... I wouldn't be here instead of with you if it wasn't for him, ya know, I'm gonna get...

649
01:05:35,559 --> 01:05:39,509
妈，我们没事的，你每天都认真工作，我们需要这笔钱
Mom, we're doin' good, you're working hard every day, and we need the money.

650
01:05:40,309 --> 01:05:41,615
一切都没事的
It's all right.

651
01:05:46,309 --> 01:05:47,909
他到底怎麽了？
What's wrong with him, anyway?

652
01:05:51,809 --> 01:05:53,809
文尼中风了
Vinny's had a stroke.

653
01:05:56,509 --> 01:06:01,309
慢一点，往下，往下，往下，很好
Slowly! Down, down, down, down, down, good.

654
01:06:01,509 --> 01:06:05,509
膝盖弯曲，腰挺直，很好
Bend the knees, flat back, good, good.

655
01:06:05,809 --> 01:06:09,709
膝盖弯曲，再下来一点，再下来一点，好，好
Bend the knees, a little bit, a little bit. All right, all right, good.

656
01:06:09,909 --> 01:06:14,109
我选择圣威廉罗切斯特，收养小孩的圣人
I chose St. William of Rochester, the patron saint of adopted children.

657
01:06:14,409 --> 01:06:20,463
其实这故事很有趣，我看过其它的圣人，都很，神圣
It's a pretty interesting story, all the other saint I looked at were all so... saintly, I guess.

658
01:06:21,109 --> 01:06:23,059
「神圣」的意思是什麽？
What does "saintly" mean to you?

659
01:06:23,109 --> 01:06:27,009
我不知道，我其实不相信圣人
I don't know, I don't really believe in saints and all that.

660
01:06:27,409 --> 01:06:32,709
我觉得圣威廉成为圣人只是因为他收养小男孩后被杀
I feel like St. William just got to be a saint because he's killed by the boy he adopted.

661
01:06:33,509 --> 01:06:37,609
现在，人们常常被杀，但并没有因此变成圣人
These days, people get killed all the time, and they don't get to be a saint for it.

662
01:06:37,909 --> 01:06:39,809
好吧，谢谢你，奥利佛
All right, well, thanks, Oliver.

663
01:06:42,509 --> 01:06:48,209
虽然小奥利佛不愿回应，但我正好相信现在还是充满圣人
Despite young Oliver's reticence, I DO happen to believe there are saints all around us today.

664
01:06:48,809 --> 01:06:54,509
也许他们并不是受到信仰成为圣人，但他们跟课本上的人一样重要
They may never be considered as such by a religion, but they are just as important as the ones in your textbooks.

665
01:06:54,609 --> 01:06:59,509
因此，你们要回去找你们认识，或知道
Thus, you are going to research someone you know, or know of,

666
01:06:59,609 --> 01:07:03,609
并判断他们是否有资格成为圣人
and determine if they have the qualities fit for sainthood.

667
01:07:06,809 --> 01:07:11,109
- 他在哪？他的车在这  - 他在医院
- Where is he? His car is here. - He's in the hospital.

668
01:07:11,609 --> 01:07:12,909
怎麽了？
For what?

669
01:07:13,209 --> 01:07:18,109
- 你怎麽跟文森特认识的？  - 我替他工作
- So, how did you and Vincent know each other? - I'm working for this man.

670
01:07:18,609 --> 01:07:21,309
喔，做什麽？
Oh! Doing what?

671
01:07:22,209 --> 01:07:25,809
工作，我是舞者
Working. I work for dancer.

672
01:07:29,609 --> 01:07:31,509
听起来真刺激
Sounds exciting.

673
01:07:33,409 --> 01:07:35,609
试著说说看
Try to sound it out.

674
01:07:37,709 --> 01:07:39,109
不对
Not quite.

675
01:07:39,909 --> 01:07:41,814
你看起来并没有失去幽默感
You didn't lose your sense of humor.

676
01:07:41,909 --> 01:07:46,808
- 嘿，文森特，你有访客了  - 我只会待五分钟
- Hey! Vincent! You got some visitors. - I stay five minutes only.

677
01:07:46,809 --> 01:07:48,809
医院是个烂地方
Hospital is shit place.

678
01:07:49,209 --> 01:07:51,209
你看起来好多了，文
You look a lot better, Vin.

679
01:07:57,809 --> 01:07:59,309
你说什麽？
What'd ya say?

680
01:08:07,209 --> 01:08:08,609
文森
Vince.

681
01:08:10,009 --> 01:08:13,409
我们给文多一点时间复健吧
How about we just give Vin some time to do his therapy.

682
01:08:13,709 --> 01:08:14,958
谢谢你，可能需要一个小时
Thank you. It'll be about an hour.

683
01:08:15,153 --> 01:08:19,309
- 下地狱吧，一个小时  - 也许不用一个小时
- Go to hell. An hour. - Maybe less.

684
01:08:19,409 --> 01:08:23,009
为什麽你这麽坏，你可以去死啦，浑蛋
Why are you so mean, you could stop breathing. Asshole.

685
01:08:23,109 --> 01:08:28,009
- 好吧，我们，嘿，我们买些零食吃吧  - 谢谢，我饿死了
- Okay, how 'bout we... hey, we get him a snack, want a snack? - Thanks, I'm starving.

686
01:08:30,709 --> 01:08:34,480
你知道，他们做的事是让测试他的肌肉跟舌头的反应
Ya know, they does things that his muscles and his mouth'll respond to therapy.

687
01:08:34,659 --> 01:08:36,659
所以，这是好事
So, that's good.

688
01:08:36,709 --> 01:08:39,708
- 他看起来...  - 就跟智障一样
- He sounds... - Like the retard.

689
01:08:39,709 --> 01:08:44,309
嗯，他还是好人，所以讲他智障差不多
Well, he's still good man anyway, so the retard is not that far.

690
01:08:45,809 --> 01:08:49,909
你有一块钱吗？我很饿，我整天都没吃东西
Do you have dollar, I'm starving, I eat nothing today?

691
01:08:50,809 --> 01:08:54,009
- 嗯，我可能有  - 嗯
- Here, I probably have something. - Yeah.

692
01:08:57,809 --> 01:09:01,009
一块半更好
Maybe dollar half is better.

693
01:09:02,209 --> 01:09:05,909
- 好吧  - 谢谢
- All right. - Spasiba.

694
01:09:11,009 --> 01:09:11,973
她怀的是文森的...
Is that Vince's...?

695
01:09:12,329 --> 01:09:13,509
- 婴儿吗？ - 嗯
- baby? - Yeah.

696
01:09:14,009 --> 01:09:16,909
我不太介入他的私事
I'd like to stay away from the whole situation.

697
01:09:19,209 --> 01:09:25,314
- 而且问一个女人是否怀孕很不礼貌  - 嗯，我想她很明显是怀孕了
- It's not polite to ask a woman if she's pregnant. - Well, I think it's pretty obvious that she' pregnant.

698
01:09:25,709 --> 01:09:27,208
文看起来90岁了，妈...
Vin's like 90 something, Mom...

699
01:09:27,609 --> 01:09:33,258
嘿，如果你踢贩卖机，就会多掉一个，这样你就有两个了，不错吧
If you kick this machine, its first candy drops, you can get two to come down, it's good, no?

700
01:09:33,809 --> 01:09:35,009
谢谢你
Thank you.

701
01:09:50,509 --> 01:09:52,109
嗯，真该死
Well, cocksucker.

702
01:09:56,309 --> 01:09:58,909
不要吃这麽快，你这蠢猫
Don't eat fast, stupid cat.

01:22:10,109 --> 01:22:11,709
不用租金
Rent free.

826
01:22:12,409 --> 01:22:15,709
我很遗憾，文...你的损失
Sorry, Vin... for your loss.

827
01:22:16,909 --> 01:22:22,609
我从来搞不懂为什麽要说这句话
Never understood why people say that.

828
01:22:24,009 --> 01:22:26,309
我们不知道要说什麽
They don't know what else to say.

829
01:22:26,709 --> 01:22:33,709
怎不说「她以前长怎样？」「你想念她吗？」或是「你现在要做什麽？」
How about: "What was she like?", "Do you miss her?"or "What are you gonna do now?"

830
01:22:38,109 --> 01:22:42,409
帮你自己一个忙，好好过生活
Do yourself a favor, get a life.

831
01:22:43,309 --> 01:22:45,109
不要像我一样
Stop livin' mine.

832
01:22:47,409 --> 01:22:52,109
好好记住，不要浪费在我这种废人身上
Take my word, it's not workin' for shit for me.

833
01:22:53,009 --> 01:23:00,109
- 这不是事实  - 你以为我是什麽样的人？
- That's not true. - What the hell do you know about me?

834
01:23:02,209 --> 01:23:07,809
你根本不认识我，你只是蠢蛋
You don't know me, you're just stupid.

835
01:23:10,509 --> 01:23:12,209
我当然很蠢
Of course I'm stupid.

836
01:23:13,109 --> 01:23:19,909
大部分人只认为你是喝醉的坏老头
Mostly for thinking you're more that just a drunk, mean, old man.

837
01:23:21,709 --> 01:23:24,109
我想可以说再见了
Guess that's goodbye.

838
01:23:27,909 --> 01:23:31,109
你很悲伤，悲伤的人
You're sad.

839
01:23:45,709 --> 01:23:49,709
我喜欢你到了月亮，珊蒂
I loved you to the moon there, Sandy.

840
01:23:51,509 --> 01:23:53,009
满月
A June moon.

841
01:24:53,309 --> 01:24:58,209
好吧，两个星期，两星期后要报告你们的圣人
All right, 2 weeks, 2 weeks to Are Saints Among Us assembly.

842
01:24:58,409 --> 01:25:03,208
到时候你的努力要在舞台上展现
The grand culmination of your sizable efforts on one great stage.

843
01:25:03,209 --> 01:25:08,208
不要忘记邀请你的父母，重要的人，老婆，女朋友
Don't forget to invite your parents, significant others, et cetera, wives, girlfriends,

844
01:25:08,209 --> 01:25:12,708
还有好好享受，还有发表时禁止骂葬话，奥兹
and enjoy yourselves, and no expletives in your presentation please Ozinski.

845
01:25:12,709 --> 01:25:16,009
他不喜欢被叫奥斯，杰拉蒂老师，他不喜欢
He doesn't like Ozinski, Brother Geraghty, never has.

846
01:25:16,409 --> 01:25:18,109
我叫罗伯特，老师
My names Robert, Sir.

847
01:25:32,509 --> 01:25:35,109
- 他没跟你讲过他以前是军人？  - 没有，先生
- He didn't tell you he was a soldier? - No, Sir.

848
01:25:35,409 --> 01:25:38,909
他以前是士官长，很有名
A sergeant major of all things, he's famous.

849
01:25:42,609 --> 01:25:44,009
但这太贵了
But it's too expensive,

850
01:25:44,109 --> 01:25:49,409
我不知道怎麽...这很便宜欸
I don't know how to... ... it's cheap enough.

851
01:25:49,609 --> 01:25:53,709
- 喔，这一个，很棒欸  - 女士，不好意思，这价格标错了
- Oh! This one, this is good. - Ma'am, I'm sorry, this is the wrong price.

852
01:25:54,259 --> 01:25:55,853
不，不，不，我喜欢
No, no, no, I like this.

853
01:25:55,903 --> 01:25:58,009
我喜欢这个
I love this.

854
01:25:58,309 --> 01:26:00,623
我们可以买这个吗？我们付得起
Can we get this? We can afford this.

855
01:26:00,673 --> 01:26:03,548
- 女士  - 我喜欢，我想要
- Ma'am... - I like this! I want this!

856
01:26:03,609 --> 01:26:07,109
我们可以带走吗，好，带走吧
Can we take? Okay, I'll take it.

857
01:26:14,809 --> 01:26:18,309
- 就是那个老人？  - 嗯，他以前在越南
- That's the old guy? - Yeah, he was in Vietnam.

858
01:26:18,409 --> 01:26:20,809
- 那是哪一个州？  - 那是国家
- Did I study the States? - It's a country.

859
01:26:20,909 --> 01:26:23,209
州是在国家之内
States are inside countries.

860
01:26:23,509 --> 01:26:26,409
请不要将东西放置在婴儿的脖子周围
"Do not place items with string around child's neck,"

861
01:26:26,509 --> 01:26:29,209
「例如头套，细绳，奶嘴绳」
"such as hoods, strings, or pacifier cords.".

862
01:26:29,309 --> 01:26:32,009
细绳可能造成窒息
"Strings can cause strangulation."

863
01:26:32,709 --> 01:26:34,809
我不想要这个婴儿床
I don't want this crib.

864
01:26:40,409 --> 01:26:42,209
嘿，爸
Hey, Dad.

865
01:26:42,709 --> 01:26:44,709
- 你过的好吗？  - 嗯
- Have a good day? - Yeah.

866
01:26:44,809 --> 01:26:46,009
繫上安全带
Seat belt, please.

867
01:26:46,209 --> 01:26:52,909
- 文替珊蒂洗了多久的衣服？  - 喔，老天，每个星期连续八年
- How long has Vin been doin' Sandy's laundry? - Oh, geez, every week for 8 years.

868
01:26:53,509 --> 01:26:56,109
- 这真的很久  - 的确很久
- That's a long time. - It IS a long time.

869
01:26:56,509 --> 01:26:58,209
他是个老人，文
He's a good guy... Vin.

870
01:27:07,609 --> 01:27:12,609
- 我不在文身边的时候是什麽样子？  - 他不喜欢人，大家也不喜欢他
- What's Vin like when I'm not around? - He don't like people, people don't like him.

871
01:27:13,009 --> 01:27:16,009
除了猫跟你之外，你为什麽喜欢他？
Except cat and you. Why you like him?

872
01:27:24,409 --> 01:27:26,809
喔，这可真直接
Oh, it'll be straight.

873
01:27:31,209 --> 01:27:33,309
奥利佛，快点
Oliver, come on!

874
01:27:35,209 --> 01:27:39,009
早餐好了喔，快要冷了
Breakfast is ready! Gonna get cold!

875
01:27:41,109 --> 01:27:42,809
走吧
Let's go!

876
01:27:46,309 --> 01:27:49,509
- 海，妈  - 不要这麽惊讶，坐下吧
- Hi, Mom. - Don't look so surprised, sit down.

877
01:27:50,209 --> 01:27:53,109
你的大日子要吃好一点，坐啊
Need some fuel for your big day, right? Sit.

878
01:27:54,109 --> 01:27:57,509
- 都是你做的吗？  - 嗯，都是我做的，我知道怎麽做菜
- You made all this? - Yes, I made it all, I know how to cook.

879
01:27:57,609 --> 01:27:59,709
- 我今天放假  - 谢谢
- I took the day off. - Thanks.

880
01:28:00,509 --> 01:28:02,109
不客气，小家伙
You're welcome, Bub.

881
01:28:02,209 --> 01:28:06,309
你不会吗？我来教你
Did you have any trouble? Come here, I'll show you the trick.

882
01:28:06,509 --> 01:28:08,609
你要先把领子立起来
You gotta pop this up.

883
01:28:10,305 --> 01:28:11,353
好的
Okay.

884
01:28:12,609 --> 01:28:17,504
- 神奇的事发生了  - 我爱你，妈
- Now that's magic. - I love you, Mom.

885
01:28:19,309 --> 01:28:20,909
我也是
Me, too.

886
01:28:21,409 --> 01:28:24,609
坐下，你要咖啡还是果汁
Sit down, okay, coffee or juice?

887
01:28:24,809 --> 01:28:28,009
- 拿铁  - 很敢挑嘛
- Latte. - Nice try.

888
01:28:37,809 --> 01:28:40,909
- 我的羊水破了  - 叫水管工
- My water is broken! - Call a plumber.

889
01:28:41,409 --> 01:28:45,109
快走啊，起床
Let's go! Get up!

890
01:28:57,409 --> 01:29:00,208
各位好，坐下吧，孩子们，谢谢
Hello... sit down children, thank you.

891
01:29:00,209 --> 01:29:04,509
早安，欢迎参加圣派翠克小学的「我们身边的圣人」发表会
Good morning, welcome to Are Saints Among Us assembly at St. Patrick.

892
01:29:04,709 --> 01:29:06,908
小朋友们都非常努力
And the children have been working very hard.

893
01:29:07,009 --> 01:29:11,108
看到他们选择谁是圣人应该很有趣
And it'll be interesting to see which parents they have chosen as saints.

894
01:29:11,109 --> 01:29:13,109
我想你们应该都很紧张
I'm sure you're all very nervous.

895
01:29:14,109 --> 01:29:18,009
我们第一位发表者是琪夏
Our first speaker is Keesha Demorsey.

896
01:29:24,609 --> 01:29:28,709
真实圣人，我选择泰瑞莎修女
For my real-life saint, I picked Mother Teresa of Calcutta.

897
01:29:31,709 --> 01:29:34,012
- 这....这，  - 好吧，好吧
- This... it's... - Okay, okay.

898
01:29:34,062 --> 01:29:35,990
先停下，先停
Stop anywhere, anywhere.

899
01:29:39,609 --> 01:29:42,909
你什麽时候才会像个男人一样
When will you become like man?

900
01:29:46,009 --> 01:29:47,909
老天，我的尊严
Jesus, my manhood!

901
01:29:48,309 --> 01:29:50,809
圣尼可拉斯，各位鼓掌
St. Nicolas of Sunny Side, everybody.

902
01:29:54,109 --> 01:29:58,509
好了，下一位发表的是奥利佛伯朗，奥利佛伯朗
All right, next up we have Oliver Bronstein... Oliver Bronstein.

903
01:30:05,309 --> 01:30:10,908
「圣人就是牺牲并致力奉献于其他人的人」
"Saints are human beings we celebrate for their commitment and dedication to other human beings."

904
01:30:10,909 --> 01:30:15,309
引用自杰拉蒂老师，三月左右
Brother Geraghty, circa, around March.

905
01:30:21,009 --> 01:30:24,143
- 这裡不是医院  - 现在你又变成火箭医生了吗
- This isn't the hospital. - So, now you're a rocket surgeon.

906
01:30:24,209 --> 01:30:26,509
快点，进去吧
Come on, get inside.

907
01:30:27,009 --> 01:30:33,009
现代的圣人，我选择的人如同圣威廉罗彻斯特拥有许多价值
For my modern-day saint I chose a man who shares many of the same qualities as St. William of Rochester.

908
01:30:33,209 --> 01:30:38,029
从表面上来看，也许有人会认为我选择的圣人是最不像圣人的人
On the surface, one might think my saint is the least likely candidate for sainthood.

909
01:30:39,009 --> 01:30:40,730
他也不是很开心的人
He's not a happy person.

910
01:30:40,780 --> 01:30:44,509
他不喜欢其他人而其他人也不喜欢他
He doesn't like people and not many people like him.

911
01:30:44,809 --> 01:30:49,109
他脾气暴躁，易怒，愤世嫉俗，我敢肯定他充满遗憾。
He's grumpy, he's angry, he's mad at the world, I'm sure full of regrets.

912
01:30:50,209 --> 01:30:54,008
他喝太多酒，抽淤，赌博，诅咒别人，说谎和欺骗
He drinks too much, he smokes, he gambles, curses, lies and cheats.

913
01:30:54,009 --> 01:30:56,509
而且花许多时间与夜晚的淑女在一起
And he spends a lot of time with the Lady of the Night.

914
01:31:00,409 --> 01:31:02,144
这是你们对他的第一印象
That's what you see at first glance.

915
01:31:03,509 --> 01:31:06,909
如果你们深入了解，不管他的过错
If you dig deeper you see a man beyond his faults.

916
01:31:08,509 --> 01:31:11,509
文森特麦肯纳先生出生于1946年
Mr. Vincent McKenna was born in 1946

917
01:31:11,609 --> 01:31:16,909
羊头湾，是第一代的爱尔兰移民之子
in Sheepshead Bay the son of first generation Irish immigrants.

918
01:31:19,109 --> 01:31:21,219
在布鲁克林街头出身贫困
Growing up poor on the streets of Brooklyn,

919
01:31:21,269 --> 01:31:24,409
文森特学会了许多小孩子不该知道的事
Vincent learned all the things that kids shouldn't need to know:

920
01:31:24,609 --> 01:31:27,109
打架，诅咒以及赌博
Fighting, cursing and gambling.

921
01:31:28,609 --> 01:31:33,109
1965年，身为美军第五军团的成员
In 1965, as a member of the United States Army 5th Regiment,

922
01:31:33,309 --> 01:31:38,009
文森特与其他450名军人投身德浪河谷
Vincent was among the four hundred and fifty soldiers dropped into La Drang Valley

923
01:31:38,109 --> 01:31:41,209
并受到2000位敌军的攻击
and immediately ambushed by 2000 enemy troops.

924
01:31:41,709 --> 01:31:46,272
那时他英勇地拯救了两名受伤的军官
There he heroically saved the lives of two wounded officers pinned down by enemy fire.

925
01:31:46,322 --> 01:31:48,440
并带他们脱离险境
And carried them to safety.

926
01:31:48,809 --> 01:31:52,209
之后他被授予青铜星奖励其勇敢行为
Has was awarded the bronze star for his bravery.

927
01:31:52,509 --> 01:31:55,909
我想跟你们解释文森特麦肯纳先生的最好方式就是
I imagine the best way to tell you who Mr. Vincent McKenna is

928
01:31:56,009 --> 01:31:58,509
跟你们解释他为我做了什麽
is to tell you what he's done for me.

929
01:31:59,809 --> 01:32:02,908
我跟我妈刚搬到这裡时，我们不认识任何人
When me and my mom first moved here, we knew no one.

930
01:32:02,909 --> 01:32:05,308
而麦肯纳先生接纳我
And Mr. McKenna took me in.

931
01:32:05,409 --> 01:32:08,250
他本来不需要，而正确来说，不想要...
When he didn't have to, and most likely, didn't want to...

932
01:32:08,309 --> 01:32:12,109
但他还是做了，因为这是圣人会做的事
but he did it anyhow, 'cause THAT'S what saints do.

933
01:32:13,009 --> 01:32:17,309
我们造访了他结缡四十年的妻子，珊蒂，最近刚过世
We visited his wife, Sandy, of 40 years, who recently passed away.

934
01:32:17,409 --> 01:32:22,603
文在过去八年内，每个星期都替她洗衣服，即使她已经不记得文
Vin's done her laundry EVERY week for the past 8 years, long after she no longer recognized him.

935
01:32:22,709 --> 01:32:25,309
因为圣人永不放弃
Because saints never give up.

936
01:32:25,409 --> 01:32:31,508
他教我怎麽对抗，如何坚定立场以及勇敢，如何大声说话与有魄力
He taught me how to fight, how to stand my ground and be brave, how to speak up and be bold.

937
01:32:31,509 --> 01:32:35,809
因为圣人会替自己与他人对抗，因此声音才会被听到
Because saints fight for themselves and others, so that they might be heard.

938
01:32:36,109 --> 01:32:39,208
他教我怎麽赌博，赛马，玩乐透
He taught me how to gamble, horse racing, Keno,

939
01:32:39,209 --> 01:32:44,409
还有其他，所以我会被禁足到18岁
the Over and Under, which is a big reason why I'm grounded 'til I'm eighteen.

940
01:32:45,709 --> 01:32:50,009
但我学到风险以及孤注一掷
But in that I learned how to take risks and go for broke.

941
01:32:50,309 --> 01:32:53,409
因为人生的赔率会对你不利
Because in life the odds can be stacked against you.

942
01:32:53,809 --> 01:32:58,509
这是文森的猫，菲力，牠吃高级猫粮而文森吃沙丁鱼罐头
This is Vin's cat, Felix, who eats gourmet cat food while Vin eats sardines.

943
01:32:58,609 --> 01:33:01,509
因为圣人勇于牺牲
'Cause saints make sacrifices.

944
01:33:02,209 --> 01:33:06,109
没错，文森特麦肯纳先生有缺陷，严重缺陷
Yes, Mr. Vincent McKenna is flawed, seriously flawed,

945
01:33:06,309 --> 01:33:08,902
但就跟我们曾经学过的其他圣人一样
But just like the all the other saints we studied,

because, after all, saints are human beings... very human beings.

- 我也许应该学一下  - 麦肯纳先生，时间差不多了
- I might have to adopt that. - Mr. McKenna, it's about that time.

959
01:35:11,109 --> 01:35:14,809
好吧，拿去，不过严格来说你还是偷东西
All right, hold your horses. Though, technically, that's stealing.

960
01:35:26,009 --> 01:35:28,409
不要哭，没事...
You don't cry, it's okay...

961
01:35:29,109 --> 01:35:33,009
所以是？黑人？白人？丑人？

It is not Russian, but... Sorry, cat!

967
01:35:59,809 --> 01:36:03,708
- 你一定得吃蔬菜  - 色彩很丰富，我得说
- You must eat vegetables. - It's colorful, I'll say that.

968
01:36:03,709 --> 01:36:06,309

- I like the green beans. - You do?

969
01:36:06,409 --> 01:36:10,008
嗯，我觉得你的义大利麵跟绿豆不太够
Yeah, I don't think you ever get enough spaghetti and green beans.

970
01:36:10,009 --> 01:36:12,909

为什麽侏儒不行？
