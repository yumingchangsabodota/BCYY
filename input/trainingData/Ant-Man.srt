他看起来不太高兴

你好，汉克

00:00:19,003 --> 00:00:20,636
你不是应该在莫斯科吗
You're supposed to be in Moscow.

我顺路去了趟
I took a detour

6
00:00:23,166 --> 00:00:24,833
你的防御实验室
through your defense lab.

7
00:00:26,036 --> 00:00:28,036
告诉我这不是我想的那个东西
Tell me that isn't what I think it is.

8
00:00:28,069 --> 00:00:32,469
要么就是你们照着我的研究搞了个差劲的山寨货
It depends if you think it's a poor attempt to replicate my work.

9
00:00:32,646 --> 00:00:35,713
就算在这里，也需要点勇气
Even for this group, that takes nerve.

10
00:00:35,963 --> 00:00:38,830
我得提醒你一下，皮娒博士，你已经被派遣到俄国了
You were instructed to go to Russia.May I remind you, Dr. Pym, that

11
00:00:38,883 --> 00:00:39,950
而且你是个士兵-
you're a soldier-

12
00:00:40,119 --> 00:00:40,686
我是个科学家
I'm a scientist.

13

那就像个科学家的样子
Then act like one.

14
00:00:42,317 --> 00:00:45,217
皮娒粒子是已发现的科学技术中最具革命性的
The Pym Particle is the most revolutionary science ever developed

15
00:00:45,301 --> 00:00:48,525
- 我们需要你把它用在正确的地方 - 你先是让我当你的小跟班
- Help us put it to good use.
- First you turn me into your errand boy

16
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:51,087
现在还想把我的研究也偷走吗？
and now you try to steal my research?

17
00:00:51,371 --> 00:00:55,304
皮娒博士，如果你当初能在那次暴行中保护好珍妮特
If only you'd protected Janet with such ferocity, Dr. Pym.

18
00:01:00,292 --> 00:01:01,292
别这样，汉克
Easy, Hank.

19
00:01:03,325 --> 00:01:05,885
你再敢提我妻子一次
You mention my wife again

20
00:01:05,885 --> 00:01:07,700
我就让你见见什么叫暴行
and I'll show you ferocity.

21
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:10,161
别看我，这话是你说的
Don't look at me, you said it.

22
00:01:11,150 --> 00:01:13,250
我正式提出辞职
I formally tender my resignation.

23
00:01:13,343 --> 00:01:15,276
我们不会正式批准的
We won't accept it. Formally.

24
00:01:15,981 --> 00:01:16,781
汉克
Hank,

25

皮娒粒子是个奇迹
The Pym Particle is a miracle. Please,

27
00:01:21,369 --> 00:01:23,869
请不要因为你的事埋没了它
Don't let your past determine the future.

28
00:01:23,934 --> 00:01:26,401
只要我还有一口气
As long as I am alive,

29
00:01:26,463 --> 00:01:30,130
就没有人能得到那个方程式
nobody will ever get that formula.

30
00:01:36,962 --> 00:01:38,595
我们不能让他离开这里
We shouldn't let him leave the building.

31
00:01:38,599 --> 00:01:40,966
你已经骗他了，现在还想打他吗
You've already lied to him, now you want to go to war with him?

32
00:01:41,003 --> 00:01:42,003
是
Yes.

33
00:01:42,548 --> 00:01:45,781
我们的技术员连山寨他的边都还差得远呢
Our scientists haven't come close to replicating his work.

34
00:01:45,855 --> 00:01:47,922
他刚才打你脸打得啪啪响
He just kicked your ass full size.

35
00:01:47,944 --> 00:01:51,477
你真想尝尝那种“他来了你却看不见”的滋味吗
You really want to find out what it's like when you can't see him coming?

36
00:01:51,489 --> 00:01:54,889
我认识汉克·皮娒很久了，他不是个威胁
I've known Hank Pym for a long time, he's no security risk.

37
00:01:56,951 --> 00:01:58,484
除非我们把他逼到那里
Unless we make him one.

那我要是从左边来一下呢
I mean, what if I come in on the left side, right...

47
00:02:57,799 --> 00:02:59,866
你看这里，就是这儿

伙计们，你们的告别仪式真是不可思议
Man, you guys got the weirdest goodbye rituals.

51

好了，散了吧
All right, break it up.

52
00:03:36,672 --> 00:03:38,805
斯考特！你好吗伙计

你眼睛是怎么回事
Hey what's up with your eye?

哦，还能是谁，陶陶呗，离别礼物
Oh, well, what do you think. Peachy. His going-away present.

- 可不是 - 是呀
- Oh yeah. - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

59
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:57,220
你知道么，我依然是唯一一个打败他的
You know what?  I'm still the only one to knock him out.

60
00:03:57,305 --> 00:03:59,194
是吗，我反正是没有
Well, I definitely didn't.

61

谢谢你来接我，兄弟

Oh, now, you think I'm gonna miss my cellmate getting out?

然后我爸被驱逐出境了
And my dad got deported.

68

我还有个女儿要照顾
I got a daughter to take care of.

79
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:37,060
你知道有前科的人可是不好找工作的对吧
You know that jobs don't come easy for ex-cons right?

80
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:39,940
听着伙计，我好歹还有个电子工程学的硕士学位
Look man, I got a masters in electrical engineering, all right?

81
00:04:41,004 --> 00:04:42,235

Look, I'm sorry, all right, but I...no one would hire me.

101
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:35,103
非法入侵，重大盗窃

所以你已经被炒了
Well, you're fired of course.

115
00:06:04,652 --> 00:06:05,952
我不可能再留着你了
I can't really keep you on.

116
00:06:05,974 --> 00:06:06,974
等等，什么？
Wait, what?

117

Dale, look, it wasn't a violent crime, I mean, I'm a good worker.

00:06:11,093 --> 00:06:13,892
是的，不是暴力犯罪，是个相当赞的犯罪。
No, it wasn't a violent crime. It was a cool crime.

121
00:06:14,422 --> 00:06:19,555
你知道么，虽说这件事我不会告诉任何人，也不会有任何记录，如果…
I'll tell you what, though, this'd be totally off the books, off the records, but uh...

122
00:06:19,569 --> 00:06:23,269
你走的时候顺手顺走几杯你做的那个芒果果冰…
If you want to grab you one of those Mango Fruit Blasts on your way out the door,

123
00:06:23,365 --> 00:06:25,632
我绝对会假装没看见的
I'll just pretend I didn't see it.

124
00:07:04,034 --> 00:07:05,034
嘿，斯考特，一切都好？

我去上了，我被炒了

127
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:11,780
真糟，他们发现你有前科了？

嗯。
Yeah.

00:07:12,693 --> 00:07:14,693
芭斯罗缤什么都知道，兄弟
Baskin Robbins always finds out, bro.

130
00:07:14,768 --> 00:07:16,395
芭斯罗缤可不糊弄
Baskin Robbins don't play.

131
00:07:16,413 --> 00:07:17,880
要不要来点华夫饼？
You want some waffles?

132
00:07:18,383 --> 00:07:19,884
好吧，我来一块
Yeah, I'll take a waffle.

133
00:07:20,053 --> 00:07:24,000
哦，这是科特  他在佛森监狱呆了五年，是个顶级黑客
Oh.  That's Kurt.  He was in Folsom for five years, he's a wizard on that laptop.

134
00:07:24,974 --> 00:07:25,734
幸会
Nice meet you.

135
00:07:25,747 --> 00:07:27,547
我也是
Yeah, nice to meet you too.

136
00:07:28,112 --> 00:07:29,254
那你是？
Who are you?

137
00:07:29,609 --> 00:07:30,609
戴夫
Dave.

138
00:07:31,549 --> 00:07:33,349
维斯塔那票干的不错
Nice work on the Vista job.

139
00:07:34,090 --> 00:07:37,989
维斯塔那票？是吗 哦不，我听说过那次抢劫
Vista job?  Yes.  No, no, I have heard of this robbery.

140
00:07:38,175 --> 00:07:41,475
呃，严格来说，我没抢他们，抢劫要涉及到威胁恐吓
Well, technically, I didn't rob them. Robbery involves threat.

141
00:07:41,577 --> 00:07:44,254
我讨厌暴力，我只是偷了他们，我是个飞贼（字面意思为猫贼）
I hate violence, I burgled them. I'm a cat burglar.

142
00:07:44,350 --> 00:07:45,950
你说你是个怂逼？（本意是小猫咪，但常用作脏话）
You mean you're a pussy?

143
00:07:46,218 --> 00:07:47,018
算是吧
Yeah.

144
00:07:46,997 --> 00:07:49,002
那伙人一直黑客户的钱
They were overcharging the customers, right?

145
00:07:49,152 --> 00:07:52,532
黑了上百万的利润后，他就被踢出去了
And it added up to millions.  He blows the whistle and he gets fired.

146
00:07:52,591 --> 00:07:56,162
然后他是怎么反击的，直接黑进了系统里
And what does he do?  He hacks into the security system,

147
00:07:56,162 --> 00:07:58,813
把那上百万的利润全还给被偷的人啦
And transfers millions back to the people that they stole it from.

148
00:07:58,824 --> 00:08:00,849
还把所有的银行记录全公开了
Posts all the bank records online.

149
00:08:00,947 --> 00:08:02,980
最后还把那家伙的宾利开进游泳池了
And he drove dude's Bentley into a swimming pool.

150
00:08:05,591 --> 00:08:06,858
你这是要干嘛
What are you doing?

151
00:08:07,697 --> 00:08:09,397
- 嗯？ - 呃，我…
- Hmm? - Oh...I...

152
00:08:09,485 --> 00:08:11,884
你干嘛告诉他们我的事儿
Why are you telling my life story to these guys?

153
00:08:11,916 --> 00:08:13,049
你到底想怎样
What do you want?

154
00:08:13,578 --> 00:08:14,478
好吧
Okay.

155
00:08:14,575 --> 00:08:16,075
我表弟俩礼拜前遇到了个伙计
My cousin talked to this guy two weeks ago

156
00:08:16,324 --> 00:08:18,291
聊到了一票特别棒的活儿
about this little, perfect job.

157
00:08:18,292 --> 00:08:19,092
不干
No way.

158
00:08:19,191 --> 00:08:21,505
别别，你听我说，这个人绝对和你的胃口
No no no wait hey!  This guy, this guy fits your M.O.

159
00:08:21,514 --> 00:08:22,398
不行！
No!

160
00:08:22,668 --> 00:08:24,998
我不干了，我不想再被关进去了
I'm finished man. I'm not going back to jail.

161
00:08:25,073 --> 00:08:27,204
这个人可是个退休的百万富翁，曾经拥有个公司的
It's some retired millionaire living off his golden parachute,

162
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:29,014
根本就是你斯科特·朗的标准猎物啊
It's a perfect Scott Lang mark.

163
00:08:29,335 --> 00:08:31,102
我才不管呢，我不干
I don't care. I'm out.

164
00:08:50,039 --> 00:08:51,159
皮娒博士？
Dr. Pym?

165
00:08:51,187 --> 00:08:53,785
是我，还活着呢
Yes. I'm still alive.

166
00:09:01,019 --> 00:09:02,019
证件
I.D.

167
00:09:02,955 --> 00:09:05,028
我觉得那个就够了
Perhaps that will suffice.

168
00:09:07,310 --> 00:09:09,746
实在是很抱歉阁下，请进吧
Very sorry sir, please come in.

169
00:09:11,841 --> 00:09:13,508
那不是汉克·皮娒吗
Is that Hank Pym?

170
00:09:17,987 --> 00:09:19,291
早晨好，汉克
Good morning, Hank.

171
00:09:20,458 --> 00:09:21,540
霍普
Hope.

172
00:09:21,844 --> 00:09:24,169
叫我声爸你能死啊？
Would it kill you to call me dad?

173
00:09:24,499 --> 00:09:28,492
看到你能抽空过来，克罗斯博士一定会非常高兴的
Well, Dr. Cross will be so pleased that you could find time to join us today.

174
00:09:28,523 --> 00:09:30,000
应该说，非常激动
More like, thrilled.

175
00:09:30,805 --> 00:09:34,767
我也没想到居然能收到你的邀请，达伦
And I'm surprised to receive any kind of invitation from you, Darren.

176
00:09:35,047 --> 00:09:36,577
是什么大新闻？
What's the occasion?

177
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:38,886
你会知道的，是吧霍普
Oh, you'll see. Won't he Hope?

178
00:09:42,975 --> 00:09:44,775
我们在里面等您
We're ready for you inside.

179
00:09:45,527 --> 00:09:46,526
哎唷
Ouch!

180
00:09:47,974 --> 00:09:50,940
都这么多年了还是没忘呢
I guess some old wounds never heal, huh?

181
00:09:51,555 --> 00:09:53,435
没事，她被照顾的很好
Don't worry, she's in good hands.

182
00:09:55,147 --> 00:09:56,613
你会非常喜欢的
You're in for a treat.

183
00:09:59,494 --> 00:10:03,650
好久不见啊皮娒博士，退休感觉如何啊？
Long time no see, Dr. Pym. How's retirement?

184
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:05,287
那你的脸感觉如何啊？
How's your face?

185
00:10:08,730 --> 00:10:10,030
您先请
After you.

186
00:10:17,944 --> 00:10:21,661
在我们开始之前，我要隆重介绍一位客人
Now before we start I'd like to introduce a very special guest,

187
00:10:21,683 --> 00:10:24,150
我们公司的创始人，也是我的导师
this company's founder and my mentor,

188
00:10:24,371 --> 00:10:25,571
汉克·皮娒博士
Dr. Hank Pym.

189
00:10:41,050 --> 00:10:43,350
在我接替皮娒博士管理公司之后
When I took over this company for Dr. Pym,

190
00:10:43,390 --> 00:10:47,890
我马上开始了研究一种，可以改变原子间距的基本粒子
I immediately started researching a particle that could change the distance between atoms

191
00:10:47,979 --> 00:10:51,179
从而可以增强物质密度及强度
while increasing density and strength.

192
00:10:51,791 --> 00:10:55,390
我并不知道为什么这个革命性的想法
Why this revolutionary idea remained buried beneath

193
00:10:55,390 --> 00:10:58,990
会被埋葬在汉克博士的研究中
the dust and cobwebs of Hank's research, I couldn't tell you.

194
00:10:59,006 --> 00:11:00,139
但是，请假设一下
But just imagine.

195
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:05,033
只有昆虫大小的士兵
A soldier the size of an insect.

196
00:11:09,013 --> 00:11:10,813
将会是一种终极秘密武器
The ultimate secret weapon.

197
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:25,260
也就是蚁人，呵呵
An "Ant-Man". Heh heh.

198
00:11:25,632 --> 00:11:27,298
他们就是这么称呼你的
That's what they called you.

199
00:11:27,349 --> 00:11:28,349
是吧，汉克
Right, Hank?

200
00:11:32,103 --> 00:11:35,436
挺蠢的，我知道，政治宣传而已
Silly, I know.  Propaganda.

201
00:11:35,483 --> 00:11:37,253
一个令人震惊的传说
Tales to astonish!

202
00:11:38,136 --> 00:11:40,743
一个用来吓唬苏联编出来的屁话
Trumped up B.S. to scare the U.S.S.R.

203
00:11:40,759 --> 00:11:43,499
汉克，你能不能当着所有客人的面
Hank, will you tell our guests

204
00:11:43,558 --> 00:11:48,858
再回答一遍我问过很多次的那个问题
what you told me every single time I asked you,

205
00:11:49,501 --> 00:11:51,360
蚁人存在过吗？
Was the Ant-Man real?

206
00:11:52,235 --> 00:11:53,954
只是传说罢了
Just a tall tale.

207
00:11:53,938 --> 00:11:54,938
好吧
Right.

208
00:11:55,042 --> 00:11:57,775
那么神奇的事怎么可能是真的呢
Because how could anything so miraculous possibly be real?

209
00:12:08,706 --> 00:12:11,972
不过受到蚁人故事的启发
Well I was inspired by the legend of the Ant-Man.

210
00:12:12,323 --> 00:12:15,156
同时也基于我的那项成果，可以缩小无机材料的技术
And with my breakthrough, shrinking inorganic material,

211
00:12:15,181 --> 00:12:18,081
我就想，是不是也可以缩小人体呢？
I thought, could it be possible to shrink a person?

212
00:12:19,208 --> 00:12:20,475
这有没有可能呢？
Could that be done?

213
00:12:21,352 --> 00:12:22,352
于是
Well,

214
00:12:23,387 --> 00:12:25,440
这不再是个传说了
it's not a legend anymore.

215
00:12:27,617 --> 00:12:32,816
尊敬的来宾们，我现在隆重向各位介绍可以终结战争的
Distinguished guests, I am proud to present the end of warfare as we know it:

216
00:12:33,655 --> 00:12:34,788
黄蜂装甲
the Yellowjacket.

217
00:12:41,823 --> 00:12:45,090
黄蜂装甲是为战争定制的专用武器
The Yellowjacket is an all-purpose weapon of war

218
00:12:45,834 --> 00:12:50,534
能够改变装备者的体型，可以极大的发掘其战斗优势
capable of altering the size of the wearer for the ultimate combat advantage.

219
00:12:51,117 --> 00:12:53,684
在目前这个到处充满监控的时代里
We live in an era in which the weapons

220
00:12:53,777 --> 00:12:57,809
用来保护我们自己的武器被持续不断的削弱着
we use to protect ourselves are undermined by constant surveillance.

221
00:12:57,889 --> 00:13:00,356
是时候改变这一切了
It's time to return to a simpler age,

222
00:13:00,518 --> 00:13:06,218
在这里，我们可以自由公开地保护自己的利益
one where the powers of freedom can once again operate openly to protect their interests.

223
00:13:06,232 --> 00:13:09,465
黄蜂装甲，一个全功能维和战斗装甲
An all-purpose peace-keeping vessel, the Yellowjacket

224
00:13:09,494 --> 00:13:12,661
可以处理各种因地缘政治格局发生的冲突
can manage any conflict on the geo-political landscape,

225
00:13:12,669 --> 00:13:13,869
完全隐形
completely unseen.

226
00:13:14,662 --> 00:13:18,395
可同时有效的用于防范措施和战术突击
Efficient in both preventative measures and tactical assault,

227
00:13:18,455 --> 00:13:21,387
可开展的行动包括监控
practical applications include surveillance,

228
00:13:21,893 --> 00:13:23,627
工业破坏
industrial sabotage,

229
00:13:24,202 --> 00:13:28,069
以及消除任何威胁和平的障碍
and the elimination of obstructions on the road to peace.

230
00:13:28,794 --> 00:13:34,694
仅一件黄蜂装甲就为用户开展保护行动提供了无限的可能性
A single Yellowjacket offers the user unlimited influence to carry out protective actions

231
00:13:34,701 --> 00:13:39,701
而在不久的将来，装备黄蜂装甲的军队将创造一个
and one day soon, an army of Yellowjackets will create a sustainable environment

232
00:13:39,862 --> 00:13:41,929
可持续发展的和平世界
of well-being around the world.

233
00:13:42,795 --> 00:13:43,927
黄蜂装甲
The Yellowjacket.

234
00:13:45,584 --> 00:13:46,584
所以就是件制服
So it's a suit.

235
00:13:50,147 --> 00:13:51,614
不要这样嘛，弗朗克
Don't be crude, Frank.

236
00:13:52,313 --> 00:13:53,846
不仅仅是件制服，它也…
It's not a suit, it's a...

237
00:13:53,915 --> 00:13:54,915
是件战斗装甲
it's a vessel.

238
00:13:55,729 --> 00:13:57,362
怎么，完全没有动心吗？
What's the matter, you're not impressed?

239
00:13:57,402 --> 00:14:00,002
哦，我动心了，但我也很担心
Oh, I'm impressed.  I'm also concerned.

240
00:14:00,211 --> 00:14:03,477
想象一下如果这项技术被敌方掌握
Imagine what our enemies could do with this tech.

241
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:07,552
关于这个我们可以好好讨论一下，弗朗克，我真的很看重你的意见
We should have a longer conversation about that, Frank.  I really value your opinion.

242
00:14:08,891 --> 00:14:10,691
感谢各位的光临，霍普？
Thank you for coming. Hope?

243
00:14:11,247 --> 00:14:14,114
非常感谢各位，我来送各位出去，谢谢
Thank you very much everybody. I will escort you out now.  Thank you.

244
00:14:18,333 --> 00:14:19,866
你看起来有点惊讶
You seem a bit shocked.

245
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:20,940
达伦
Darren,

246
00:14:21,215 --> 00:14:24,215
我一直保密是有原因的
there's a reason that I buried these secrets.

247
00:14:24,359 --> 00:14:26,059
你终于承认了！
So you finally admit it.

248
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:28,967
我们本来可以一起做的，汉克
We could've done this together, Hank.

249
00:14:29,049 --> 00:14:30,249
但是全被你毁了
But you ruined that.

250
00:14:31,555 --> 00:14:35,088
- 这就是为什么未来是我的，而你只能活在过去 - 别这样
- That's why you're the past and I'm the future. - Don't do this.

251
00:14:35,539 --> 00:14:36,539
克罗斯博士
Dr. Cross.

252
00:14:38,987 --> 00:14:41,587
如果你先卖给我们，我可以多付你百分之20
If you sell to me first, twenty percent over your asking price,

253
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,533
两周内就可以现金到付
I can have the cash here in two weeks.

254
00:14:43,539 --> 00:14:44,539
就这么定了
Deal.

255
00:14:53,774 --> 00:14:55,840
我们得开始行动了，汉克
We have to make our move, Hank.

256
00:14:55,865 --> 00:14:56,732
他还差多少
How close is he?

257
00:14:56,819 --> 00:14:59,186
他还不能缩小活体
He still can't shrink a live subject.

258
00:14:59,357 --> 00:15:02,357
你就给我那件战斗服吧，我可以结束这一切
Just give me the suit, let me finish this once and for all.

259
00:15:02,438 --> 00:15:03,438
不行
No.

260
00:15:03,638 --> 00:15:05,438
克罗斯完全信任我
I have Cross's complete trust.

261
00:15:05,462 --> 00:15:06,229
这太危险了
It's too dangerous.

262
00:15:06,325 --> 00:15:07,858
可我们已经没得选了
We don't have a choice.

263
00:15:08,055 --> 00:15:10,122
那可不一定
Well, that's not entirely true.

264
00:15:11,851 --> 00:15:13,518
我想我找到了个合适的人
I think I found a guy.

265
00:15:15,496 --> 00:15:16,496
谁？
Who?

266
00:15:21,219 --> 00:15:22,219
爹地！
Daddy!

267
00:15:22,644 --> 00:15:23,644
小花生！
Peanut!

268
00:15:23,722 --> 00:15:25,222
哦，生日快乐！
Oh! Happy birthday!

269
00:15:26,987 --> 00:15:29,220
真是对不起我迟到了，我不知道聚会开始的时间
I'm so sorry I'm late, I didn't know what time your party started.

270
00:15:29,312 --> 00:15:30,979
可是我写在邀请函上了呀！
It was on the invitation!

271
00:15:31,078 --> 00:15:32,945
我们没给他发邀请函
He didn't get an invitation!

272
00:15:33,003 --> 00:15:34,270
但他依然是来了
But he came anyway.

273
00:15:34,641 --> 00:15:37,407
我怎么可能会错过我宝贝女儿的生日聚会呢
Well, I'm not going to miss my little girl's birthday party.

274
00:15:37,553 --> 00:15:39,953
- 我要去告诉妈咪你来了 - 呃，这就不用了…
- I'm gonna go tell mommy you're here. - Oh, you don't...

275
00:15:40,070 --> 00:15:41,070
你干嘛来了，朗
What are you doing here, Lang?

276
00:15:41,470 --> 00:15:43,002
你还欠着一堆的抚养费呢
You haven't paid a dime in child support.

277
00:15:43,050 --> 00:15:44,666
你知道我要是愿意的话，我现在就可以逮捕你
You know, right now if I wanted to, I could arrest you.

278
00:15:44,666 --> 00:15:46,023
我也很高兴见到你，帕克斯顿
Good to see you too, Paxton.

279
00:15:46,037 --> 00:15:50,237
妈咪听说你来了高兴的都呛到了 哈哈哈
Mommy's so happy you're here, she choked on her drink.  Ha ha.

280
00:15:50,742 --> 00:15:52,742
嘿，看我给你带什么来了
Hey, look what I have for you.

281
00:15:52,895 --> 00:15:54,838
我可以现在就打开吗？
Can I open it now?

282
00:15:54,892 --> 00:15:57,625
当然了小宝贝，今天是你的生日呀
Of course sweetheart, it's your birthday.

283
00:16:00,650 --> 00:16:02,616
你是我最好的朋友！
You're my bestest friend!

284
00:16:02,796 --> 00:16:04,063
这是什么鬼东西？
What is that thing?

285
00:16:04,147 --> 00:16:05,717
他好丑哦！
He's so ugly!

286
00:16:05,953 --> 00:16:07,977
我好喜欢他哦！
I love him!

287
00:16:08,194 --> 00:16:09,861
我能拿去给我朋友们看吗？
Can I go show my friends?

288
00:16:10,173 --> 00:16:11,340
当然啦宝贝儿，去吧
Yeah, of course sweetheart, go ahead.

289
00:16:12,367 --> 00:16:14,034
你是我最好的朋友！
You're my bestest friend!

290
00:16:14,325 --> 00:16:16,192
好吧，我会付抚养费的
Look, the child support is coming.

291
00:16:16,196 --> 00:16:18,263
你知道的，有前科是不那么好找工作的
All right, it's just hard finding a job when you have a record.

292
00:16:18,330 --> 00:16:20,763
我知道你会搞定的，但是现在我想请你离开
I'm sure you'll figure it out, but for now, I want you out of my house.

293
00:16:20,831 --> 00:16:23,298
- 等等，这是我女儿的生日聚会耶 - 这里是我家
- No, wait, it's my daughter's birthday! - It's my house!

294
00:16:23,312 --> 00:16:24,845
- 然后呢，她是我女儿啊 - 别这样
- So what, it's my kid! - Relax!

295
00:16:25,562 --> 00:16:26,629
你不能就这么直接过来
You can't just show up here.

296
00:16:26,634 --> 00:16:28,034
你知道的，对吧
You know that, c'mon.

297
00:16:28,038 --> 00:16:29,005
是生日聚会耶
It's a birthday party.

298
00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:30,992
是啊我知道，但你不能就这么过来
Yeah, I know, but you can't just show up.

299
00:16:31,032 --> 00:16:33,399
- 是我女儿耶 - 你根本不知道应该怎么当爸爸
- She's my daughter. - You don't know the first thing about being a father.

300
00:16:33,424 --> 00:16:37,657
玛姬，看在你是我初恋也是我朋友的份上，我得说
Maggie, I tell you this as a friend, and as the first love of my life,

301
00:16:37,694 --> 00:16:39,427
你未婚夫就是个傻帽儿
your fiance is an ass-hat.

302
00:16:39,617 --> 00:16:40,350
他才不是傻帽儿
He's not an ass-hat.

303
00:16:40,353 --> 00:16:41,853
- 嘿，你怎么说话这么难听啊 - 你跟我出来一下
- Hey, watch your language, okay! - Just give me one minute

304
00:16:41,926 --> 00:16:43,993
- 怎么难听了，我说的是帽儿 - 都别说了！
- Oh, what language. I said hat. - Stop that！

305
00:16:46,423 --> 00:16:48,157
玛姬，真的吗，就这货？
Really, Maggie? That guy?

306
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:51,647
你跟谁结婚都好啊，怎么偏偏找了个条子啊！
Come on, you could marry anyone you want, you have to get engaged to a cop?

307
00:16:51,721 --> 00:16:53,454
至少他不是个骗子吧
At least he's not a crook.

308
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:57,013
我已经在努力了好吗，我已经不那样了…
I'm trying, okay?  I've changed, uh...

309
00:16:57,021 --> 00:16:59,221
我正常生活了，也找过工作
I'm straight, I had a job, and...

310
00:17:01,703 --> 00:17:05,403
我仔细想过了，我想要好好关心她，我真的很爱她
I want to provide.  I've had a lot of time to think about it, and I love her.

311
00:17:05,493 --> 00:17:10,193
真的！我已经错过了那么多，我不想再错过了
So much.  I've missed so much time and I want to be a part of her life.

312
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:11,200
我要怎么做才行？
What do I do?

313
00:17:11,433 --> 00:17:12,766
先找个自己住的地方
Get an apartment.

314
00:17:13,237 --> 00:17:15,837
找份正经工作，按时付抚养费
Get a job, pay child support.

315
00:17:16,243 --> 00:17:19,242
你只要做了，我保证就和你谈探视权的事
And then we will talk about visitation, I promise.

316
00:17:19,631 --> 00:17:21,164
你是她心目中的英雄，斯科特
You're her hero, Scott.

317
00:17:22,562 --> 00:17:26,095
我希望你不要辜负她的期望
Just, be the person that she already thinks you are.

318
00:17:50,742 --> 00:17:54,342
我很抱歉黄蜂装甲让你有这么多的顾虑，弗兰克
I'm sorry you have such deep concerns about the Yellowjacket, Frank.

319
00:17:54,366 --> 00:17:57,233
哦，是呀，很不幸的是
Yeah, well uh, unfortunately

320
00:17:57,946 --> 00:18:00,213
我们并不能为所欲为
we can't just do whatever we want.

321
00:18:01,544 --> 00:18:03,411
可这主意很不错是吧？
Would be nice though, right?

322
00:18:04,567 --> 00:18:05,733
但我们有法则的
But there are laws.

323
00:18:05,746 --> 00:18:06,746
什么规则？法律？
What laws? Of man?

324
00:18:08,059 --> 00:18:10,259
自然法则要超越人类的法律
The laws of nature transcend the laws of man.

325
00:18:10,353 --> 00:18:13,020
可我已经超越了自然的法则
And I've transcended the laws of nature.

326
00:18:15,326 --> 00:18:17,926
达伦，我觉得你还是不明白…
Darren, I don't think you understand-

327
00:18:25,354 --> 00:18:28,087
看来还有很多问题要解决
We still haven't worked out all the bugs.

328
00:18:32,759 --> 00:18:33,759
再见，弗兰克
Goodbye Frank.

329
00:18:53,281 --> 00:18:55,681
你知道么，最近我一直在思考关于感恩的问题
You know I've been thinking a lot about gratitude lately

330
00:18:55,699 --> 00:18:59,999
就在今天早晨，我突然有了个很有趣的想法
and today during my morning meditation, an interesting thought occurred to me and

331
00:19:00,034 --> 00:19:01,601
我觉得应该和你分享
I think it might apply to you too.

332
00:19:01,628 --> 00:19:02,528
是什么呢？
How's that?

333
00:19:02,539 --> 00:19:04,472
原谅也是一种感恩
Gratitude can be forgiveness.

334
00:19:05,662 --> 00:19:09,195
这些年对汉克·皮娒的愤怒一直包围着我
I spent years carrying around my anger for Hank Pym.

335
00:19:09,572 --> 00:19:11,372
我奉献了我的才华
I devoted my genius to him.

336
00:19:12,456 --> 00:19:14,256
把我的时间全给了他
I could've worked anywhere.

337
00:19:14,818 --> 00:19:16,483
选他作为我的导师真是个失误
I chose my mentor poorly.

338
00:19:17,274 --> 00:19:19,274
可你甚至没有选择的权利
You didn't even have a choice.

339
00:19:19,626 --> 00:19:21,293
他从来就没有信任过你
He never believed in you.

340
00:19:22,722 --> 00:19:27,388
很多事情我们不得不做，可这不都是被他逼的么？
It's a shame what we had to do, but he forced us to do it, didn't he?

341
00:19:28,113 --> 00:19:31,446
不过，我们不应该为此愤怒，我们应该心怀感激
But we shouldn't be angry, we should be grateful.

342
00:19:31,778 --> 00:19:33,978
作为一个失败的导师，
Because his failures as a mentor,

343
00:19:34,649 --> 00:19:35,649
一位不合格的父亲
as a father,

344
00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:39,350
他的错误促成了我们的成就
forced us to spread our wings.

345
00:19:43,334 --> 00:19:45,000
你成功了，达伦
You're a success, Darren.

346
00:19:46,143 --> 00:19:48,743
所有的一切都是你应得的
You deserve everything coming your way.

347
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:04,500
（提现 日常开销 子女付养费）

348
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:06,500
（还要377天才能见到凯茜）

349
00:20:08,710 --> 00:20:09,510
哎唷！
Ooh!

350
00:20:10,045 --> 00:20:11,045
别作弊了
Stop cheating.

351
00:20:12,161 --> 00:20:13,627
嘿，怎样了帅哥
Hey what's up hotshot?

352
00:20:15,518 --> 00:20:16,518
可能他没听见
Maybe he didn't hear you.

353
00:20:17,147 --> 00:20:18,347
聚会怎么样？
How was the party?

354
00:20:24,741 --> 00:20:26,274
跟我说说那票活儿
Tell me about that tip.

355
00:20:26,346 --> 00:20:27,345
啥？
Wha?

356
00:20:27,599 --> 00:20:29,466
我想知道你说的那票活儿是什么
I wanna know about that tip.

357
00:20:29,755 --> 00:20:31,222
- 哦亲，太棒了！ - 牛逼了
- Oh baby, it's on! - Hot dog!

358
00:20:31,275 --> 00:20:32,075
我已经按耐不住了！
It's so on right now!

359
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:34,553
冷静点行么，我想知道这消息是怎么来的
Calm down, all right, I just need to know where it came from,

360
00:20:34,615 --> 00:20:36,148
得是个确凿的消息
it's gotta be airtight.

361
00:20:36,945 --> 00:20:37,945
好吧
Okay.

362
00:20:38,050 --> 00:20:40,417
我和我表哥埃内斯托参加了一个品酒会
I was at a wine tasting with my cousin Ernesto

363
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:42,753
主要全是红酒，然后你也知道的，我不喜欢红酒，不过
it was mainly reds, and you know I don't love reds man, y'know, but

364
00:20:42,791 --> 00:20:44,724
有一种桃红（陶红）酒，特别不错，总之还是值了
there was a rosé that saved the day, it was delightful.

365
00:20:44,823 --> 00:20:47,723
然后，我们聊起了那个曾经一起找乐子的姑娘，艾米莉
And, he tells me about this girl Emily that we used to kick it with,

366
00:20:47,744 --> 00:20:49,711
你知道么，那是我头一次摸到了咪咪
it was actually the first pair of boobs that I ever touched.

367
00:20:49,801 --> 00:20:53,333
你跑题了，跑题了！这和正事儿一点关系都没有…
It's the wrong details.  It's wro- Has nothing to do with the story.

368
00:20:53,416 --> 00:20:54,416
好好说
Go.

369
00:20:54,678 --> 00:20:56,778
然后，他跟我说
So, uh.  He tells me that:

370
00:20:56,830 --> 00:20:58,456
她不是给人做女管家么
She's working as a housekeeper now, right?

371
00:20:58,755 --> 00:21:02,355
她男朋友叫卡洛斯，是个海湾那边的帮派老大
And she's dating this dude Carlos who's a shot caller from across the bay and

372
00:21:02,366 --> 00:21:05,566
所以她就跟他讲起了主人家的事儿，是吧
she tells him about the dude that she's cleaning for. Right?

373
00:21:05,602 --> 00:21:09,769
他是那种超大牌的退休总裁，可有钱了
That he's, like, this big-shot CEO that is all retired now but he's loaded.

374
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:13,560
然后你知道卡洛斯和埃内斯托是一个垒球队的
And so, Carlos and Ernesto are on the same softball team

375
00:21:13,650 --> 00:21:15,549
没事儿就闲聊天啥的
and they get to talking, right.

376
00:21:15,607 --> 00:21:16,574
然后最牛的地方来了
And here comes the good part.

377
00:21:16,638 --> 00:21:17,638
卡洛斯说
Carlos says:

378
00:21:17,724 --> 00:21:22,024
哟哥们，内家伙家里地下室有个超大号的保险库
Yo, man. This guy's got a big-ass safe just sitting in the basement.

379
00:21:22,037 --> 00:21:23,037
巨牛掰
Just chillin'.

380
00:21:23,067 --> 00:21:25,200
埃内斯托知道我最会偷东西，所以回来就告诉我了
Of course Ernesto comes to me 'cause he knows I've got mad thieving skills.

381
00:21:25,293 --> 00:21:26,260
我当然得问他了
Of course I ask him:

382
00:21:26,263 --> 00:21:29,763
那艾米莉没跟卡洛斯说让你告诉我那个保险库什么样儿么？
Did Emily tell Carlos to tell you to get to me what kind of safe it was?

383
00:21:29,851 --> 00:21:30,551
然后他说
And he says

384
00:21:30,563 --> 00:21:33,663
没有啊，她就跟我说，是个特别高端的保险库
Naw, dog. All she said is that it's, like, super legit, and

385
00:21:33,892 --> 00:21:36,225
里面肯定有不少好东西！
whatever's in it has gotta be good!

386
00:21:39,020 --> 00:21:40,020
啥？
What?

387
00:21:40,305 --> 00:21:42,105
老头有个保鲜库
Old man have safe.

388
00:21:43,206 --> 00:21:44,573
他一礼拜都不在
And is gone for a week.

389
00:21:44,627 --> 00:21:47,727
好吧，有个老头儿，他有个保险库，老头儿出门一礼拜
All right.  There's an old man, he's got a safe, and he's gone for a week.

390
00:21:47,794 --> 00:21:49,327
那开始行动吧
Let's just work with that.

391
00:21:49,372 --> 00:21:50,505
我就说嘛
Y'know what I' sayin'.

392
00:22:39,885 --> 00:22:42,219
电话钱切断了，手机信号也屏蔽了
Landlines cut, cell signals jammed.

393
00:22:42,328 --> 00:22:44,928
现在谁也别想报警了
No one will be making for distress call tonight.

394
00:22:44,975 --> 00:22:45,975
报告下情况
All check.

395
00:22:46,045 --> 00:22:47,245
- 正常 - 正常
- Check. - Check.

396
00:22:47,643 --> 00:22:49,643
嘿，你知道如果有状况，有我在这边照顾你呢
Hey if the job goes bad, you know I got your back, right?

397
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:51,992
不能够，不可能有状况
Don't worry, it's not gonna happen.

398
00:22:55,603 --> 00:22:57,016
我就喜欢他那牛逼劲儿
I love it when he gets cocky.

399
00:23:03,296 --> 00:23:04,496
卧操！
Damn!

400
00:23:32,086 --> 00:23:33,086
警报器已经关了
Alarm is dead.

401
00:23:33,509 --> 00:23:34,509
厉害！
Nice!

402
00:23:36,701 --> 00:23:39,367
好，我现在要进屋子里去了
All right, I'm moving through the house.

403
00:24:04,052 --> 00:24:05,952
这门上有个指纹识别锁
There's a fingerprint lock on the door.

404
00:24:06,036 --> 00:24:07,003
有个啥？
He's got a what?

405
00:24:07,064 --> 00:24:08,964
埃内斯托没跟我说有这个啊
Ernesto didn't tell me nothing about that.

406
00:24:08,975 --> 00:24:10,575
不是吧，这就没戏了吗？
Aw, man, are we screwed?

407
00:24:10,826 --> 00:24:11,893
那也不一定
Not necessarily.

408
00:25:00,943 --> 00:25:01,943
我进来了
I'm in.

409
00:25:01,995 --> 00:25:04,562
一个警报都没触发，他简直神了
No alarms have been triggered. He's in like the Flynn.

410
00:25:09,230 --> 00:25:10,630
不是吧…
Oh, man.

411
00:25:10,674 --> 00:25:11,674
怎么啦？
What is it?

412
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:15,447
他们说对了，还真是个高端的保鲜库
Well they weren't kidding. This safe is serious.

413
00:25:15,732 --> 00:25:17,799
有多高端啊，斯科特
How serious we talkin', Scotty?

414
00:25:17,998 --> 00:25:19,198
卡本代尔的
It's a Carbondale.

415
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:20,600
1910年产的
It's from 1910.

416
00:25:20,990 --> 00:25:23,723
用的是和泰坦尼克号一样的那种钢材
Made from the same steel as the Titanic.

417
00:25:24,070 --> 00:25:25,070
喔！
Wow.

418
00:25:25,119 --> 00:25:26,252
你能给弄开吗？
Can you crack it?

419
00:25:26,605 --> 00:25:27,838
嗯，倒是有个办法
Well, here's the thing.

420
00:25:27,929 --> 00:25:30,196
这种钢材不耐低温
It doesn't do so well in the cold.

421
00:25:30,303 --> 00:25:31,670
还记得撞船的那个冰山吗
Remember what that iceberg did?

422
00:25:31,769 --> 00:25:33,269
哦，我知道，把小李子（莱奥纳多·迪卡布里奥）弄死了。
Yeah, man, it killed DiCaprio.

423
00:25:33,278 --> 00:25:34,411
所有人都死了
Killed everybody.

424
00:25:34,489 --> 00:25:35,789
那老太太就没死！
Did not kill the old lady.

425
00:25:35,855 --> 00:25:38,655
最后还把那项链扔海里了呢！
She still throw the jewel into the oceans.

426
00:26:30,693 --> 00:26:31,693
你干什么呢？
What're you doing?

427
00:26:31,772 --> 00:26:34,572
我往锁定装置里面灌了水，然后用液氮冷冻
I poured water in the locking mechanism and froze it with nitrogen.

428
00:26:35,216 --> 00:26:37,016
水结冰会膨胀，但是金属不会
Ice expands, metal doesn't.

429
00:26:38,339 --> 00:26:39,272
那现在呢？
What are you doing now?

430
00:26:39,334 --> 00:26:40,334
等一下
Waiting.

431
00:26:41,469 --> 00:26:42,469
还得等一下
Waiting.

432
00:26:50,799 --> 00:26:51,799
行了
Nice.

433
00:26:56,093 --> 00:26:57,759
里面是什么？现金？珠宝？
What is it, cash? Jewels?

434
00:26:59,253 --> 00:27:00,353
这儿什么都没有啊！
There's nothing here.

435
00:27:00,422 --> 00:27:01,422
你说什么？
What'd you say?

436
00:27:02,223 --> 00:27:03,523
就有一件制服
It's a suit.

437
00:27:03,541 --> 00:27:04,541
啥？
What?

438
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:07,087
一件旧的摩托车赛车服
It's an old motorcycle suit.

439
00:27:07,913 --> 00:27:09,780
没有现金？也没有珠宝？啥都没有？
There's no cash, no jewelry, nothing?

440
00:27:09,807 --> 00:27:10,806
没有。
No.

441
00:27:12,236 --> 00:27:13,236
真倒霉
It's a bust.

442
00:27:13,684 --> 00:27:15,351
我很抱歉，斯科特
I'm really sorry, Scotty.

443
00:27:16,054 --> 00:27:17,854
让你失望了
I know you needed a score.

444
00:27:52,310 --> 00:27:54,243
我以为我们要用老鼠的
I thought we were using mice?

445
00:27:54,543 --> 00:27:56,009
有什么区别吗
What's the difference?

446
00:27:57,389 --> 00:27:59,055
实验34-C现在开始
Commence experiment 34-C,

447
00:28:00,448 --> 00:28:02,115
有机体的原子缩小
organic atomic reduction.

448
00:28:02,726 --> 00:28:03,826
达伦，我们应该再考虑一…
Darren, maybe we should think-

449
00:28:03,906 --> 00:28:06,406
缩小有机组织是这项技术里最核心部分
Shrinking organic tissue is the centerpiece of this technology.

450
00:28:06,431 --> 00:28:09,831
只做了一半的技术我要怎么卖给人啊？
I can't go to the buyers with half a breakthrough.

451
00:28:33,141 --> 00:28:36,674
34-C的实验结果
Experiment 34-C results...

452
00:28:37,302 --> 00:28:38,302
是失败
negative.

453
00:28:42,858 --> 00:28:46,124
清理操作台，准备实验品35-C
Sanitize the workstation, bring in subject 35-C.

454
00:28:57,312 --> 00:28:59,112
把这个锁起来是为什么呢？
Why would you lock this up?

455
00:29:21,335 --> 00:29:22,335
真是诡异
So weird.

456
00:29:54,699 --> 00:29:56,028
斯考特，你还好吗
Scott, what's up man?

457
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:03,677
我琢磨…这是什么呢？
I wonder...what is this?

458
00:30:34,370 --> 00:30:38,170
从下面看整个世界都不一样了，是不是斯考特？
The world sure seems different from down here, doesn't it, Scott?

459
00:30:38,186 --> 00:30:40,169
什么？谁？是谁在说话？
What? Who...who said that?

460
00:30:44,902 --> 00:30:47,433
阿毛！阿毛！我在下面！
Luis! Luis, down here!

461
00:30:48,091 --> 00:30:50,290
真是以身试火，斯考特
It's a trial by fire, Scott.

462
00:30:50,548 --> 00:30:52,055
或者更确切的说
Or in this case,

463
00:30:52,390 --> 00:30:53,670
是水
water.

464
00:31:17,618 --> 00:31:20,151
看来你比你想的要结实呢
Guess you're tougher than you thought.

465
00:31:22,607 --> 00:31:24,691
哦，我可不想看你这个…
Oh, I don't want to see this.

466
00:31:24,869 --> 00:31:25,823
阿毛！
Luis!

467
00:31:30,844 --> 00:31:32,012
你个混…
Son of a-!

468
00:32:48,789 --> 00:32:50,347
什么鬼？
What the hell?

469
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:53,452
就试驾来说你还不错嘛
Not bad for a test drive.

470
00:32:53,776 --> 00:32:55,576
衣服你留着吧
Keep the suit

471
00:32:55,576 --> 00:32:57,376
- 我会和你联系的 - 不，不，不要
- I'll be in touch. - No, no. No.

472
00:32:57,427 --> 00:32:58,427
不要，谢谢您了
No thank you.

473
00:33:10,883 --> 00:33:12,216
呆在地上不要动！
Get down on the ground!

474
00:33:12,281 --> 00:33:13,581
你被捕了！
You are under arrest!

475
00:33:13,593 --> 00:33:14,460
不，我没有偷东西！
No, I didn't steal anything!

476
00:33:14,547 --> 00:33:16,214
我只是把偷的东西还回来。
I was returning something I stole.

477
00:33:25,865 --> 00:33:29,132
你知道么，我们差点就相信你说的你“已经改了”
You know, you almost had us convinced that you were going to change your ways.

478
00:33:29,611 --> 00:33:31,810
她们都真心为你加油呢
They were really rooting for you.

479
00:33:34,263 --> 00:33:36,263
这会伤透她们的心的
It's gonna break their hearts.

480
00:33:38,316 --> 00:33:39,516
有人找你
You got a visitor.

481
00:33:40,176 --> 00:33:41,176
谁？
Who?

482
00:33:41,177 --> 00:33:42,177
你的律师
Your lawyer.

483
00:33:43,228 --> 00:33:44,228
律师？
My lawyer?

484
00:33:47,547 --> 00:33:49,814
我说了我会和你联系的，斯考特
I told you I'd be in touch, Scott.

485
00:33:50,730 --> 00:33:55,062
我现在觉得你没准更喜欢呆监狱里
I'm starting to think that you prefer the inside of a jail cell.

486
00:33:55,323 --> 00:33:56,323
天哪
Oh man.

487
00:33:56,618 --> 00:33:57,618
坐吧
Sit down.

488
00:34:01,852 --> 00:34:04,399
先生，我真的非常抱歉偷了你的衣服
Sir, I'm sorry I stole the suit.

489
00:34:04,414 --> 00:34:06,581
我甚至都不想知道你为什么会有这件衣服
I don't even want to know why you have it.

490
00:34:06,620 --> 00:34:08,420
玛姬真是一点也没看错你
Maggie was right about you.

491
00:34:10,143 --> 00:34:11,010
你怎么会知道…
How do you know about-

492
00:34:11,054 --> 00:34:14,454
难怪她不让你接近凯茜
The way she's trying to keep you away from Cassie.

493
00:34:14,544 --> 00:34:18,010
事情才刚刚有点难，你就走回犯罪的老路了
The moment things get hard, you turn right back to crime.

494
00:34:20,196 --> 00:34:22,559
但在我来看，你是有选择的
The way I see it, you have a choice.

495
00:34:22,580 --> 00:34:25,213
你可以选择在监狱里度过你的下半辈子
You can either spend the rest of your life in prison

496
00:34:25,727 --> 00:34:30,488
或者选择先回到你的房间然后等我的指示
or go back to your cell and await further instructions.

497
00:34:31,138 --> 00:34:32,405
我不太明白…
I don't understand.

498
00:34:32,461 --> 00:34:34,151
我也没指望你明白
You know I don't expect you to.

499
00:34:34,726 --> 00:34:36,526
但你现在的确没那么多选项了
But you don't have many options right now.

500
00:34:36,619 --> 00:34:38,923
坦白的说，我也没有了
Quite frankly, neither do I.

501
00:34:40,490 --> 00:34:43,989
不然一开始我也不会叫你偷走那件衣服
Why do you think I let you steal that suit in the first place?

502
00:34:44,044 --> 00:34:45,044
啥？
What?

503
00:34:55,444 --> 00:34:58,644
还有，机会可不是总会出现的。
Second chances don't come around all that much.

504
00:34:58,959 --> 00:35:01,625
所以下次你在遇到的时候
So next time you think you might see one

505
00:35:01,860 --> 00:35:06,217
我劝你千万抓紧它别松手
I suggest you take a real close look at it.

506
00:35:18,487 --> 00:35:20,220
你是我最好的朋友！
You are my bestest friend!

507
00:35:20,397 --> 00:35:22,897
你真的不想要个别的玩具吗？
Are you sure you don't want a different toy?

508
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:24,653
不想，我就喜欢这个
No, I love this one.

509
00:35:25,197 --> 00:35:26,197
那好吧
Okay.

510
00:35:26,463 --> 00:35:28,197
早点睡吧，我爱你
Well, get some sleep, I love you.

511
00:35:28,583 --> 00:35:29,845
- 妈咪 - 嗯？
- Mommy. - Hm?

512
00:35:30,204 --> 00:35:32,225
爸爸是坏人吗？
Is daddy a bad man?

513
00:35:32,469 --> 00:35:35,545
我听大人们说他是坏人
I heard some grown ups say he's bad.

514
00:35:36,737 --> 00:35:38,137
不是
No.

515
00:35:38,681 --> 00:35:41,934
爸爸只是有时候有些困惑，你明白吗？
Daddy just gets confused sometimes, you know?

516
00:36:32,982 --> 00:36:36,384
这就对了，看来你还是会听话的
Smart choice. You actually listened for once.

517
00:36:37,386 --> 00:36:38,386
门的下面
Under the door.

518
00:36:43,155 --> 00:36:44,966
行了，现在呢？
Okay. Where to now?

519
00:36:44,979 --> 00:36:46,269
抓紧
Hang tight.

520
00:36:49,735 --> 00:36:50,735
什么？你说什么？
What? What?!

521
00:36:50,972 --> 00:36:51,939
见鬼了，他跑哪去了？
Where the hell did he go?

522
00:36:51,941 --> 00:36:53,408
我也不知道，他就这么没了。
I have no idea, he just vanished.

523
00:36:53,459 --> 00:36:55,092
立刻封锁附近街区，马上做！
Set up a five block perimeter, now!

524
00:36:55,170 --> 00:36:56,803
回去！别过来！回去！
Get back, get back, get back!

525
00:36:56,843 --> 00:36:58,710
斯科特，他们是我的帮手
Scott. These are my associates.

526
00:36:58,801 --> 00:37:00,934
啊？你在蚂蚁身上装了摄像头？
Huh? You got a camera on an ant?

527
00:37:01,689 --> 00:37:03,022
是啊，当然了，为什么不装呢
Yeah, sure, why not?

528
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:04,266
那么车在哪？
Where's the car?

529
00:37:04,331 --> 00:37:05,831
没有车，但是有翅膀哦
No car, we've got wings.

530
00:37:05,892 --> 00:37:06,892
来了
Incoming!

531
00:37:17,490 --> 00:37:20,090
踩中间上去然后骑在它的胸部上面
Put your foot on the central node and mount the thorax.

532
00:37:20,171 --> 00:37:21,304
你这是开玩…这东西真的安全…
Are you ki- How safe's Th-

533
00:37:21,392 --> 00:37:23,192
赶紧给我上去，斯科特
Get on the damn ant, Scott.

534
00:37:35,337 --> 00:37:36,603
为什么我在警车里面
Why am I on a police car?

535
00:37:36,666 --> 00:37:38,799
我不应该在警车里面吧！
Shouldn't I not be on a police car?

536
00:37:38,838 --> 00:37:41,805
这样你才能搭车通过他们的封锁呀
So they can give you a lift past their five block perimeter.

537
00:37:41,814 --> 00:37:42,581
哇哦，好吧
Whoa. All right.

538
00:37:42,726 --> 00:37:44,159
现在呢，下一步怎样？
Now, what's the next move?

539
00:37:44,212 --> 00:37:45,112
抓紧骑好
Hang on tight.

540
00:37:45,177 --> 00:37:47,100
哦，这好办，我一直抓着呢
Oh, this is easy. I'm getting the hang of this.

541
00:37:47,101 --> 00:37:48,839
往上拽就向上飞了，就跟骑马一样
Yank up to go up. It's like a horse.

542
00:37:48,916 --> 00:37:51,000
你抓的247都要失去平衡了
You're throwing 247 off balance.

543
00:37:51,001 --> 00:37:53,247
- 啥，他叫247？ - 他没有名字
- Wait, his name is 247? - He doesn't have a name,

544
00:37:53,248 --> 00:37:56,710
他只有代号，你知道一共有多少只蚂蚁呢吗，斯科特？
he has a number Scott, do you have any idea how many ants there are?

545
00:37:57,530 --> 00:37:58,530
哇哦！
Whoa!

546
00:37:58,940 --> 00:38:00,240
嗯等一下，也可能是248
Maybe it's, maybe it's 248?

547
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:01,773
不，不不不！晕了，晕了！
No no no no no vertigo, vertigo!

548
00:38:01,949 --> 00:38:02,949
不，我确定就是247
No, I think it's 247.

549
00:38:04,282 --> 00:38:05,482
- 等一下 - 抓紧骑好
- Wait. - Hang on tight.

550
00:38:06,427 --> 00:38:07,427
我觉得我已经会控制他了
I think I'm getting the hang of this.

551
00:38:07,911 --> 00:38:11,178
我在控制247，他根本没听你的
I'm controlling 247. He is not listening to you.

552
00:38:11,295 --> 00:38:12,295
你说什么？
What?

553
00:38:12,509 --> 00:38:13,409
我能提个小小的要求吗
Can I make one little request?

554
00:38:13,439 --> 00:38:14,439
不能
No.

555
00:38:15,132 --> 00:38:17,731
停，247，暂停！暂停！
Stop, 247, time out, time out.

556
00:38:18,414 --> 00:38:19,414
快停下！
Time out.

557
00:38:19,688 --> 00:38:20,954
慢点，等下行么
All right, hold on.

558
00:38:21,389 --> 00:38:22,789
别，等下，慢点，嗷！
Just, wait, whoa, uh!

559
00:38:23,151 --> 00:38:25,218
我要是吐头盔里了会怎么样
What happens if I throw up in this helmet?

560
00:38:25,284 --> 00:38:27,884
那是我的头盔，不许吐！
It's my helmet Scott. Do not throw up.

561
00:38:28,376 --> 00:38:29,609
放他下来，好吗
Just set 'er down, all right?

562
00:38:29,664 --> 00:38:31,031
我有点晕
I'm getting light headed.

563
00:38:31,102 --> 00:38:32,102
坚持一下，斯科特
Hang on, Scott.

564
00:38:32,586 --> 00:38:34,219
是，我眼前有点发黑
Yeah, I'm getting a little light...

565
00:38:34,226 --> 00:38:36,004
我觉得，我需要谁…
-t's, I need, somebody...

566
00:38:37,335 --> 00:38:38,938
能…过五分钟…叫醒我…
...to hit me, in five minutes-

567
00:38:58,443 --> 00:38:59,443
你好
Hello.

568
00:39:03,051 --> 00:39:04,051
你是谁啊？
Who are you?

569
00:39:06,648 --> 00:39:09,114
你一直就站在这里看我睡觉吗？
Have you been standing there watching me sleep this whole time?

570
00:39:09,144 --> 00:39:10,144
是的
Yes.

571
00:39:10,653 --> 00:39:11,653
为什么啊
Why?

572
00:39:11,927 --> 00:39:15,727
因为上次你在这里的时候你偷了点东西
Because the last time you were here you stole something.

573
00:39:15,885 --> 00:39:17,585
哦…
Oh. Oh!

574
00:39:18,004 --> 00:39:19,004
嘿，听我说
Hey, look.

575
00:39:26,071 --> 00:39:30,848
（世界上体形最大的蚂蚁之一，因螫人时产生剧烈疼痛而得名）

576
00:39:20,287 --> 00:39:21,287
哇哦！
Whoa!

577
00:39:26,071 --> 00:39:27,337
Paraponera clavata（子弹蚁拉丁学名）
Paraponera clavata.

578
00:39:27,648 --> 00:39:30,848
来自热带地区的巨型子弹蚁，其叮咬在施氏刺痛指数中排名最高
Giant tropical bullet ants ranked highest on the Schmidt pain index,

579
00:39:30,852 --> 00:39:32,819
我不在的时候他们一直替我看着你呢
they're here to keep an eye on you when I can't.

580
00:39:33,858 --> 00:39:36,325
皮娒博士正在楼下等你呢
Dr. Pym's waiting for you downstairs.

581
00:39:37,284 --> 00:39:38,284
谁？
Who?

582
00:39:39,407 --> 00:39:41,607
啊…嘿，嗯？
Ahhh...hey, um,

583
00:39:42,399 --> 00:39:43,999
这是谁的睡衣啊？
whose pajamas are these?

584
00:39:50,624 --> 00:39:52,657
我这要怎么办？
How am I supposed to do this?

585
00:39:59,301 --> 00:40:01,435
好吧，一点一点来
All right, just one step at a time.

586
00:40:04,055 --> 00:40:05,055
呃
Ugh.

587
00:40:06,789 --> 00:40:10,961
我不踩你们，你们也别咬我，成么？
You don't bite me, I don't step on you, deal?

588
00:40:15,202 --> 00:40:17,269
我也可以处理掉服务器，克罗斯根本不会发现
I could take down the servers and Cross wouldn't even know.

589
00:40:17,285 --> 00:40:18,718
我们不需要这个人
We don't need this guy.

590
00:40:18,770 --> 00:40:21,270
我猜你已经见过我女儿，霍普了
I assume that you've already met my daughter Hope.

591
00:40:21,275 --> 00:40:22,275
见过了
I did.

592
00:40:22,464 --> 00:40:23,464
她真不错
She's great.

593
00:40:23,876 --> 00:40:25,776
她觉得我们不需要你
She doesn't think that we need you.

594
00:40:25,793 --> 00:40:27,726
就是不需要，我们自己就能做
We don't. We can do this ourselves.

595
00:40:27,795 --> 00:40:31,662
我做了一切努力让你能偷走我的衣服，结果霍普她
I go to all this effort to let you steal my suit, and then Hope

596
00:40:31,710 --> 00:40:33,323
叫警察抓了你
has you arrested.

597
00:40:33,650 --> 00:40:36,583
好吧，可以先试试，等他失败了我再自己做
Okay, we can try this and when he fails I'll do it myself.

598
00:40:36,668 --> 00:40:40,200
她有点过于紧张了，这件事必须得做
She's a little bit anxious. It has to do with this job,

599
00:40:40,246 --> 00:40:42,946
鉴于你已经坐在我对面了
which, judging by the fact that you're sitting opposite me,

600
00:40:42,998 --> 00:40:45,198
我假设你算是感兴趣了
I take it that you're interested in.

601
00:40:45,259 --> 00:40:46,159
是件什么事？
What job?

602
00:40:46,256 --> 00:40:47,856
你要来点茶么？
Would you like some tea?

603
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:49,120
呃，好啊
Uh, sure.

604
00:40:49,884 --> 00:40:54,487
你绕过我安保系统的方法给我留下来了很深的印象
I was very impressed with how you managed to get past my security system.

605
00:40:55,357 --> 00:40:58,453
尤其是冷冻破环铁门那件事
Freezing that metal was particularly clever.

606
00:40:58,918 --> 00:41:00,218
你那时候一直在监视我吗？
Were you watching me?

607
00:41:00,237 --> 00:41:03,193
斯科特，我已经观察你有一阵子了
Scott, I've been watching you for a while,

608
00:41:03,371 --> 00:41:05,983
从你抢了维斯塔公司之后就开始了
ever since you robbed Vista Corp.

609
00:41:07,331 --> 00:41:11,098
哦，抱歉，“偷”了维斯塔公司
Oh, excuse me, burgled Vista Corp.

610
00:41:12,924 --> 00:41:16,424
维斯塔的安保系统是业内非常先进的
Vista's security system is one of the most advanced in the business.

611
00:41:16,478 --> 00:41:19,678
本应是无法被破坏的，可你却破坏了它
It's supposed to be unbeatable but you beat it.

612
00:41:20,651 --> 00:41:21,784
要不要来点糖？
Would you like some sugar?

613
00:41:22,139 --> 00:41:23,139
嗯，谢啦
Yeah, thanks.

614
00:41:27,291 --> 00:41:28,891
呃，还是不用了…
You know what, I'm okay.

615
00:41:33,878 --> 00:41:35,811
你是怎么让它们做到这些的？
How do you make them do that?

616
00:41:35,847 --> 00:41:38,647
蚂蚁可以举起50倍于他们自身重量的物体
Ants can lift objects fifty times their weight.

617
00:41:38,690 --> 00:41:41,857
他们可以互相合作，建造，养殖…
They build, farm, they cooperate with each other.

618
00:41:42,195 --> 00:41:44,928
是，可是，这个，怎么做到的？
Right. But how do you make them do that?

619
00:41:46,073 --> 00:41:51,838
用电磁波呀，模拟他们的嗅觉神经信号
I use electromagnetic waves, to stimulate their olfactory nerve center.

620
00:41:53,010 --> 00:41:54,876
就可以和他们讲话了
I speak to them.

621
00:41:55,168 --> 00:41:58,768
我可以到任何地方，听见和看见任何事情
I can go anywhere, hear anything, and see everything.

622
00:41:59,078 --> 00:42:01,111
但你依然什么都不明白
And still know absolutely nothing.

623
00:42:01,393 --> 00:42:03,150
要来不及了，我得去见克罗斯了
I'm late to meet Cross.

624
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:08,180
呃……皮娒博士？
Uh...Dr. Pym?

625
00:42:08,505 --> 00:42:11,038
斯科特，你提问题时不用举手
You don't need to raise your hand, Scott.

626
00:42:11,233 --> 00:42:13,365
抱歉，我只有一个问题
Sorry, I just have one question.

627
00:42:13,491 --> 00:42:18,057
你到底谁啊她又是谁啊这都是什么鬼东西我现在能回监狱去吗？
Who are you who is she what the hell's going on and can I go back to jail now?

628
00:42:18,209 --> 00:42:19,209
跟我来
Come with me.

629
00:42:19,901 --> 00:42:23,968
20年前，我创造了一个方程式，可以改变原子间的距离
Twenty years ago I created a formula that altered atomic relative distance.

630
00:42:24,038 --> 00:42:25,038
啊？
Huh?

631
00:42:25,399 --> 00:42:29,410
我掌握了改变原子间距的技术，那件制服就是这个原理
I learned how to change the distance between atoms, that's what powers the suit,

632
00:42:29,411 --> 00:42:30,850
所以它才可以这样
that's why it works.

633
00:42:32,324 --> 00:42:33,324
哇哦！
Wow!

634
00:42:38,612 --> 00:42:40,245
- 哇哦！ - 但这也很危险
- Whoa. - But it was dangerous.

635
00:42:40,981 --> 00:42:42,381
因为太危险了
It was too dangerous.

636
00:42:44,163 --> 00:42:46,263
所以我才把它藏了起来
So I hid it from the world.

637
00:42:46,648 --> 00:42:50,848
也就是那时候，我改变了方向，创造了我的公司
And that's when I switched gears and I started my own company.

638
00:42:50,881 --> 00:42:51,881
皮娒科技
Pym Tech.

639
00:42:52,179 --> 00:42:53,179
是
Yes.

640
00:42:54,416 --> 00:42:57,549
我收了个叫做达伦·克罗斯的徒弟
I took on a young protege called Darren Cross.

641
00:42:57,853 --> 00:43:00,450
达伦·克罗斯，他可有名了
Darren Cross. He's a big deal.

642
00:43:00,550 --> 00:43:03,242
在他出名以前，他只是我的助手
But before he was a big deal he was my assistant.

643
00:43:03,307 --> 00:43:07,374
我以为我从他身上看到了什么，也许很像是我从没有过的儿子
I thought I saw something in him, a son I never had perhaps.

644
00:43:07,561 --> 00:43:10,828
他是个天才，但是随着我们的关系越来越亲密
He was brilliant, but as we became close he began to suspect

645
00:43:10,903 --> 00:43:13,370
他开始怀疑我并没有告诉他一切
that I wasn't telling him everything.

646
00:43:13,371 --> 00:43:17,171
他听到了一些关于皮娒粒子的传言
He heard rumors about what was called the Pym Particle,

647
00:43:17,636 --> 00:43:20,769
之后就一直痴迷于复制我的公式
and he became obsessed with recreating my formula.

648
00:43:21,059 --> 00:43:23,625
我不想帮他，所以他就与人串通针对我
But I wouldn't help him so he conspired against me and

649
00:43:23,708 --> 00:43:25,974
投票把我从我的公司踢了出来
he voted me out of my own company.

650
00:43:26,180 --> 00:43:27,580
他是怎么做到的？
How could he do that?

651
00:43:27,764 --> 00:43:30,630
董事会主席是我的女儿，霍普
The board's chairman is my daughter, Hope.

652
00:43:30,652 --> 00:43:32,385
是她投出了那关键一票
She was the deciding vote.

653
00:43:33,502 --> 00:43:39,150
但在发现克罗斯几乎成功破解我的方程后，她回到我身边了。
But she came back to me when she saw how close Cross was to cracking my formula.

654
00:43:39,803 --> 00:43:41,803
这个过程是非常不稳定的
The process is highly volatile.

655
00:43:42,223 --> 00:43:45,156
如果没有使用特殊的头盔防护
What isn't protected by a specialized helmet

656
00:43:45,225 --> 00:43:47,825
将会直接影响脑部的化学反应
can affect the brain's chemistry.

657
00:43:48,139 --> 00:43:54,172
我觉得达伦并没有意识到这一点，况且，他也没有那么稳重能想到这里
I don't think Darren realizes this, and y'know, he's not the most stable guy to begin with.

658
00:43:54,238 --> 00:43:56,700
那么，你想要我做什么呢
So, what do you want from me?

659
00:43:58,669 --> 00:44:02,802
斯科特，我相信每个人都应该得到一个救赎的机会
Scott, I believe that everyone deserves a shot at redemption.

660
00:44:02,857 --> 00:44:03,857
你怎么看
Do you?

661
00:44:04,190 --> 00:44:05,190
我也相信
I do.

662
00:44:05,819 --> 00:44:10,752
如果这次你能帮我，我就答应帮你处理你女儿的事情
If you can help me, I promise I can help you be with your daughter again.

663
00:44:12,265 --> 00:44:14,732
你准备好拯救你自己了吗？
Now are you ready to redeem yourself?

664
00:44:14,786 --> 00:44:16,180
完全准备好了
Absolutely.

665
00:44:16,197 --> 00:44:21,000
我洗心革面了，以后再也不干溜进去偷东西那种烂事了。
My days of breaking into places and stealing shit are done.

666
00:44:21,109 --> 00:44:22,842
你想让我做什么？
What do you want me to do?

667
00:44:23,045 --> 00:44:26,645
我想让你溜进个地方偷点东西
I want you to break into a place and steal some shit.

668
00:44:29,369 --> 00:44:31,136
你晚上在家吃饭吗？
You going to be home for dinner tonight?

669
00:44:31,136 --> 00:44:34,576
（朗的律师就是汉克·皮娒博士，皮娒科技的那个）

670
00:44:32,176 --> 00:44:34,576
嗯，在，我出去办点事
Uh, yeah. I'll pick something up, okay?

671
00:44:34,589 --> 00:44:35,588
去吧
Okay.

672
00:44:35,616 --> 00:44:36,516
有什么好事么
Good news?

673
00:44:36,528 --> 00:44:38,561
我不确定是不是件好事
Uh, I don't know. It's news.

674
00:44:38,754 --> 00:44:40,887
你是要去找我爸爸吧？
Are you trying to find my daddy?

675
00:44:43,224 --> 00:44:45,500
呃，是的，小甜心
Yeah, I am, sweetheart.

676
00:44:45,959 --> 00:44:47,692
我只是希望你爸爸能安全
I just want your daddy to be safe.

677
00:44:47,779 --> 00:44:49,446
我希望你不要抓他
Hope you don't catch him.

678
00:45:36,267 --> 00:45:38,434
这已经不是第一次他们试图获取那种可以
This isn't the first time these guys have tried to get their hands

679
00:45:38,465 --> 00:45:40,198
改变游戏规则的武器了
on game changing weaponry.

680
00:45:40,882 --> 00:45:44,182
他是米切尔·卡森，神盾局的前任防御负责人
That's Mitchell Carson, ex-head of defense at SHIELD,

681
00:45:44,266 --> 00:45:47,265
现在跑去做反政府的行当了
presently in the business of toppling governments.

682
00:45:47,326 --> 00:45:48,992
她一直想要我的技术
He always wanted my tech.

683
00:45:49,293 --> 00:45:52,959
所以除非我们能溜进去，偷走黄蜂装甲
And now, unless we break in and steal the Yellowjacket

684
00:45:53,048 --> 00:45:54,715
并且销毁所有数据
and destroy all the data,

685
00:45:55,886 --> 00:45:59,953
否则达伦·克罗斯已经会给这个世界带来混乱的
Darren Cross is gonna unleash chaos upon the world.

686
00:46:02,898 --> 00:46:06,565
我觉得，我们不是应该先通知复仇者的吗…？
I think our first move should be calling the Avengers.

687
00:46:09,257 --> 00:46:13,956
我花了半辈子的时间，就为了不让斯塔克得到这项技术
I've spent half my life trying to keep this technology out of the hands of a Stark.

688
00:46:14,037 --> 00:46:17,604
所以我是死也不会交给他们的
I'm sure as hell not going to hand-deliver it to one now.

689
00:46:17,659 --> 00:46:21,259
这可不像是钢铁侠那种可爱小粉红
This is not some cute technology like the Iron Man suit.

690
00:46:21,272 --> 00:46:24,005
这可是会对现实世界产生巨大影响的
This could change the texture of reality.

691
00:46:25,890 --> 00:46:30,290
另外他们现在大概正忙着把城市从天上摔下来玩呢（复联2）
Besides they're probably too busy dropping cities out of the sky.

692
00:46:30,432 --> 00:46:32,565
好吧，那你不能送那些蚂蚁去办吗？
Okay, then why don't you just send the ants?

693
00:46:32,655 --> 00:46:34,054
斯考特，他们只是蚂蚁
Scott, they are ants.

694
00:46:35,150 --> 00:46:39,483
他们的确可以办很多事，但也是需要一个人指挥的
Ants, they can do a lot of things, but they still need a leader.

695
00:46:39,767 --> 00:46:44,767
比如有些可以侵入那些专门设计成不可侵入的地方的人
Somebody that can infiltrate a place that's designed to prevent infiltration.

696
00:46:44,833 --> 00:46:47,633
汉克，我就是个贼，好吧，是个很棒的贼
Hank, I'm a thief. All right, I'm a good thief.

697
00:46:47,688 --> 00:46:48,388
但是这太疯狂了
But this is insane.

698
00:46:48,460 --> 00:46:50,593
他说的对汉克，你知道的
He's right Hank and you know it.

699
00:46:50,974 --> 00:46:53,574
你都已经看见了，你知道克罗斯能干出什么事来
You've seen the footage, you know what Cross is capable of.

700
00:46:53,593 --> 00:46:56,993
如果我们还有几个月的时间我也不会用他，可是我们就剩几天了
I was against using him when we had months, now we have days.

701
00:46:57,567 --> 00:46:58,967
我来穿那件制服
I'm wearing the suit.

702
00:46:58,967 --> 00:46:59,967
绝对不行
Absolutely not!

703
00:47:00,165 --> 00:47:03,332
我熟悉那里的一切，克罗斯怎么想我也清楚
I know the facility inside and out. I know how Cross thinks.

704
00:47:03,380 --> 00:47:04,880
没有人能比我更适合这个任务了
I know this mission better than anybody here.

705
00:47:04,934 --> 00:47:07,567
我们需要你接近克罗斯，不然这计划是行不通的
We need you close to Cross otherwise this mission cannot work.

706
00:47:07,615 --> 00:47:10,548
- 我们没时间浪费了 - 霍普，请你听我说，求你了
- We don't have time to screw around. - Hope, please, listen to me, please.

707
00:47:10,614 --> 00:47:11,681
他是个罪犯，我是你女儿！
He is a criminal. I'm your daughter.

708
00:47:11,700 --> 00:47:12,700
不行！
NO!

709
00:47:51,293 --> 00:47:52,493
她说的对，汉克
She's right, Hank.

710
00:47:53,276 --> 00:47:54,409
我的确不合适
I'm not your guy.

711
00:47:55,553 --> 00:47:57,420
为什么你自己不穿那件制服呢
Why don't you wear the suit?

712
00:47:57,966 --> 00:47:59,699
你以为我不想吗
You think I don't want to?

713
00:48:00,396 --> 00:48:01,396
我不能
I can't.

714
00:48:03,108 --> 00:48:04,775
我穿了太多年了
I spent years wearing it.

715
00:48:05,172 --> 00:48:06,572
这让我付出了代价
It took a toll on me.

716
00:48:15,434 --> 00:48:16,967
你是我们唯一的选择了
You're our only option.

717
00:48:22,242 --> 00:48:26,042
在霍普失去她妈妈之前，她一直把我
Before Hope lost her mother, she used to look at me like

718
00:48:26,303 --> 00:48:28,703
当作是世界上最伟大的人
I was the greatest man in the world.

719
00:48:30,667 --> 00:48:34,266
可是现在她看我的眼神中只有失望
And now she looks at me and it's just disappointment.

720
00:48:37,449 --> 00:48:38,849
对我来说已经太迟了
It's too late for me.

721
00:48:40,768 --> 00:48:41,835
但你不是
But not for you.

722
00:48:42,815 --> 00:48:44,149
这是你的机会
This is your chance.

723
00:48:44,485 --> 00:48:48,085
一个重新变回你女儿心目中英雄的机会
The chance to earn that look in your daughter's eyes.

724
00:48:48,472 --> 00:48:51,938
变回她心底一直坚信的那个英雄
To become the hero that she already thinks you are.

725
00:48:52,713 --> 00:48:54,847
这并不是为了拯救我们生活的这个世界
It's not about saving our world.

726
00:48:55,868 --> 00:48:57,834
这是为了拯救她们心中的那个世界
It's about saving theirs.

727
00:49:01,676 --> 00:49:03,609
哇塞，你说的真是太感人了
Damn, that was a good speech.

728
00:49:04,562 --> 00:49:05,562
斯科特
Scott.

729
00:49:06,384 --> 00:49:09,584
我需要你成为蚁人
I need you to be the Ant-Man.

730
00:49:13,770 --> 00:49:17,803
如果使用正确的话，制服与穿戴者是共生的
In the right hands, the relationship between man and suit is symbiotic.

731
00:49:17,955 --> 00:49:21,287
制服具有力量，而穿戴者可以驾驭力量
The suit has power, the man harnesses that power.

732
00:49:21,665 --> 00:49:24,398
你要有技巧，足够灵敏，而想要做到这些
You need to be skillful, agile, and above all,

733
00:49:24,463 --> 00:49:25,796
你得够快
you need to be fast.

734
00:49:26,061 --> 00:49:29,527
你得能在很短的时间内缩小或者还原体型
You should be able to shrink and grow on a dime, so

735
00:49:29,554 --> 00:49:32,751
这样才能发挥体型的优势
your size always suits your needs.

736
00:49:34,438 --> 00:49:36,538
现在，从钥匙孔里钻过来，斯科特
Now dive through the keyhole, Scott.

737
00:49:36,578 --> 00:49:38,711
保持正常体型冲刺，缩小钻过去
You charge big, you dive small,

738
00:49:38,868 --> 00:49:40,495
然后再马上恢复正常
then you emerge big.

739
00:49:43,044 --> 00:49:44,043
嗷！
Ow!

740
00:49:45,532 --> 00:49:46,532
啊！
Ah!

741
00:49:47,417 --> 00:49:48,217
噢
Ow.

742
00:49:48,228 --> 00:49:49,228
真没用
Useless.

743
00:49:51,466 --> 00:49:52,799
当你变小的时候，你的力量也被集中了
When you're small energy is compressed

744
00:49:52,834 --> 00:49:54,901
你依然有成年男人的力量
so you have the force of a 200 pound man

745
00:49:54,925 --> 00:49:57,055
并可以将其集中在百分之一英寸的点上
behind a fist a 100th of an inch wide

746
00:49:57,056 --> 00:49:58,235
你就像个子弹一样
you're like a bullet.

747
00:49:58,298 --> 00:50:00,002
如果出拳太重，你会把人杀死
You punch too hard, you kill someone,

748
00:50:00,014 --> 00:50:01,647
太轻，又完全没有用
too soft, it's a love-tap.

749
00:50:01,711 --> 00:50:03,278
换句话说，你得学会怎么出拳
In other words you have to know how to punch.

750
00:50:03,279 --> 00:50:05,101
我在监狱里呆了三年呢，我当然知道怎么出拳
I was in prison for three years, I know how to punch.

751
00:50:05,102 --> 00:50:06,101
打一个看看
Show me.

752
00:50:06,989 --> 00:50:08,488
- 太烂了 - 那你来一个给我瞧瞧
- Terrible. - You want to show me how to punch?

753
00:50:08,722 --> 00:50:09,722
让我看…
Show me-

754
00:50:11,860 --> 00:50:13,260
这才叫一拳
That's how you punch.

755
00:50:14,004 --> 00:50:16,057
- 她就等着这个呢 - 咱不开玩笑
- She's been looking forward to this. - No kiddin'.

756
00:50:16,064 --> 00:50:19,174
霍普在…呃…那件事之后参加过格斗训练
Hope trained in martial arts at a, uh, difficult time.

757
00:50:19,195 --> 00:50:21,428
哦，说到那件事，他指的是在我妈妈死后
Oh, by difficult time, he means when my mother died.

758
00:50:21,519 --> 00:50:23,452
她死于一次坠机事故
We lost her in a plane crash.

759
00:50:23,554 --> 00:50:27,321
你不告诉我她的死因就已经够了，能别再编故事了吗？
It's bad enough you won't tell me how she died, could you please stop telling me that lie.

760
00:50:27,378 --> 00:50:28,645
我们现在有正经事办
We're working here.

761
00:50:31,952 --> 00:50:34,485
行了小公主，起来干活了
All right princess, let's get back to work.

762
00:50:34,563 --> 00:50:36,430
你那是手吗？！
Were you going for the hand?

763
00:50:42,939 --> 00:50:45,072
你知道么，我觉得这个控制器很碍事
You know, I think this regulator is holding me back.

764
00:50:45,081 --> 00:50:47,214
别动那个控制器
Do not screw with the regulator.

765
00:50:47,736 --> 00:50:51,303
如果那个控制器坏掉了，你会进入亚原子态
If that regulator is compromised you would go sub-atomic.

766
00:50:51,536 --> 00:50:52,869
那是啥意思？
What does that mean?

767
00:50:53,588 --> 00:50:55,820
就是说你会进入量子空间领域
It means that you would enter a quantum realm.

768
00:50:55,918 --> 00:50:56,751
那又是啥意思？
What does that mean?

769
00:50:56,840 --> 00:51:01,873
就是说你会不断的缩小，你会进入一个现实中的时间
It means that you would enter a reality where all concepts of time and space

770
00:51:01,878 --> 00:51:05,711
与空间概念都会变得与你永远无关的世界
become irrelevant as you shrink for all eternity.

771
00:51:07,033 --> 00:51:08,766
你所知道的一切
Everything that you know,

772
00:51:09,228 --> 00:51:10,761
所爱的一切
and love,

773
00:51:11,609 --> 00:51:13,135
都会永远消失
gone forever.

774
00:51:14,504 --> 00:51:17,258
哇，太酷了，我是说…如果他不坏的话
Cool. Yeah. I'm- If it ain't broke.

775
00:51:18,253 --> 00:51:21,918
关于制服你已经学的差不多了，现在你该学学关于你那些厉害的盟友了
You've learned about the suit, but you've yet to learn about your greatest allies

776
00:51:22,886 --> 00:51:24,500
蚂蚁们
the ants.

777
00:51:24,501 --> 00:51:28,118
他们忠诚，勇敢，同时也是你的搭档
Loyal, brave, and your partners on this job.

778
00:51:33,945 --> 00:51:36,878
长角立毛蚁，也叫狂蚁
Paratrechina longicornis, commonly known as crazy ants,

779
00:51:36,905 --> 00:51:38,605
他们速度极快，同时还可以导电
they're lightning fast and can conduct electricity

780
00:51:38,639 --> 00:51:41,572
可以用来烤烂敌人的电子设备
which makes them useful to fry out enemy electronics.

781
00:51:41,832 --> 00:51:43,364
你看起来不怎么疯狂呀
Oh you're not so crazy.

782
00:51:44,299 --> 00:51:45,433
嘿！
Hey!

783
00:51:46,088 --> 00:51:47,088
你真可爱
You're cute.

784
00:51:48,425 --> 00:51:49,425
哦，啊啊啊阿！
Oh! Aaah!

785
00:51:55,435 --> 00:51:57,902
刚才那一秒真的特别吓人
That was a lot scarier a second ago.

786
00:52:06,006 --> 00:52:07,006
啊啊啊阿！
Aaah!

787
00:52:07,360 --> 00:52:10,494
这个炫酷实验室应该是有个独立的电源
It looks like the Futures lab has its own isolated power supply.

788
00:52:10,570 --> 00:52:13,103
这里有保安昼夜不停的站岗
There's a security guard posted around the clock, we need you

789
00:52:13,159 --> 00:52:15,926
我们需要你把他引开来解除安保系统
to take him out to deactivate the security systems.

790
00:52:15,992 --> 00:52:16,992
好的
Okay.

791
00:52:17,060 --> 00:52:18,060
下一个
Who's next?

792
00:52:20,232 --> 00:52:21,432
Paraponera clavata（子弹蚁）
Paraponera clavata.

793
00:52:21,508 --> 00:52:22,908
哈，我知道那个，就是子弹蚁，你说过
I know. Bullet ants, right?

794
00:52:22,975 --> 00:52:24,975
施氏刺痛指数第一名的那个
Number one on the Schmidt pain index.

795
00:52:25,071 --> 00:52:25,871
你们好呀
Hey guys!

796
00:52:25,905 --> 00:52:27,838
还记得我吗，卧室里的那个
Remember me from the bedroom?

797
00:52:27,903 --> 00:52:28,703
噢噢噢噢！
Whoa!

798
00:52:29,283 --> 00:52:31,049
黄蜂装甲存放在一个密不透风的存储舱中
The Yellowjacket pod is hermetically sealed

799
00:52:31,144 --> 00:52:35,844
唯一能够入侵的通道是一个5毫米宽的管道
and the only access point is a tube we estimate to be about 5 millimeters in diameter.

800
00:52:35,892 --> 00:52:37,559
我突然觉得有点恶心
Why do I have a sick feeling in my stomach?

801
00:52:37,596 --> 00:52:40,263
那个管道设有激光网防护，我们只能把电源切断
The tube is protected by a laser grid and we can only power that down

802
00:52:40,301 --> 00:52:41,634
大概15秒钟
for fifteen seconds.

803
00:52:41,719 --> 00:52:44,500
你需要控制狂蚁去烧掉服务器，拿到装甲
You're going to need to signal the crazy ants to blow the servers,

804
00:52:44,501 --> 00:52:48,903
然后在后备电源启动前逃出那个存储舱
retrieve the suit, and exit the vaults, before the backup power comes on.

805
00:52:48,931 --> 00:52:50,665
宾夕法尼亚弓背蚁
Camponotus pennsylvanicus.

806
00:52:50,807 --> 00:52:53,340
也可以叫它黑木蚁
Alternatively known as a carpenter ant.

807
00:52:53,436 --> 00:52:55,769
是理想的陆空交通工具
Ideal for ground and air transport.

808
00:52:56,179 --> 00:52:58,246
等一下，我认识他
Wait a minute, I know this guy.

809
00:52:58,436 --> 00:53:00,370
我要给他起名叫安东尼
I'm going to call him Antony.

810
00:53:01,221 --> 00:53:02,554
呃，很好，非常好
That's good, that's, that's very good

811
00:53:02,601 --> 00:53:03,734
因为这次
because this time

812
00:53:04,173 --> 00:53:07,373
你得学会怎么自己控制他了
you're really going to have to learn how to control him.

813
00:53:07,437 --> 00:53:10,170
让他们把糖块放到茶杯里
Tell them to put the sugar in the teacup.

814
00:53:13,124 --> 00:53:14,257
哦，打疼你了吗，霍…
Oh, you okay Dr.-

815
00:53:21,616 --> 00:53:22,616
啊！
Ah!

816
00:53:23,481 --> 00:53:24,481
嗷！
Ah!!

817
00:53:25,788 --> 00:53:28,021
汉克叫你出去做投掷训练
Hank wants you outside for target practice.

818
00:53:28,080 --> 00:53:30,680
这制服本身是没有武器的，所以我给你做了这些飞盘
The suit has no weapons so I made you these discs.

819
00:53:30,745 --> 00:53:31,745
红色的可以缩小
Red shrinks.

820
00:53:33,032 --> 00:53:34,815
而蓝色的可以放大
Blue enlarges.

821
00:53:36,805 --> 00:53:38,405
火蚁
Solenopsis mandibularis.

822
00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:43,106
被叮刺后会有灼烧感因而得名，同时也是杰出的建筑师
Known for their bite, the fire ants have evolved into remarkable architects.

823
00:53:43,151 --> 00:53:46,777
他们有能力带你进出很多地方
They are handy to get you in and out of difficult places.

824
00:53:55,875 --> 00:53:57,809
你能做到的，斯科特
You can do it Scott, come on.

825
00:54:00,875 --> 00:54:02,342
他们根本不听我的
They're not listening to me.

826
00:54:02,389 --> 00:54:04,456
你得是发自内心的，集中精神的想
You have to commit, you have to mean it.

827
00:54:05,458 --> 00:54:06,925
别老想着走捷径，也不要撒谎
No shortcuts, no lies.

828
00:54:08,090 --> 00:54:12,123
你也不用老是骂他啊，这没有任何帮助，霍普
Throwing insults into the mix will not do anyone any good, Hope.

829
00:54:12,179 --> 00:54:13,612
我可没功夫宠着他
We don't have time for coddling.

830
00:54:13,673 --> 00:54:16,040
我们现在的重点是要帮助斯科特
Our focus should be on helping Scott.

831
00:54:16,087 --> 00:54:17,654
是么？
Really?

832
00:54:18,234 --> 00:54:20,501
这就是我们的重点咯？
Is that where our focus should be?

833
00:54:44,196 --> 00:54:45,196
霍普！
Hope!

834
00:54:54,324 --> 00:54:56,924
我真不知道为什么一开始会找上你
I don't know why I came to you in the first place.

835
00:55:05,844 --> 00:55:07,777
没有她我们根本做不到
We can't do this without her.

836
00:55:12,566 --> 00:55:13,566
我的天哪
Oh God.

837
00:55:13,611 --> 00:55:15,344
你可得锁好门
You gotta lock your doors.

838
00:55:15,618 --> 00:55:16,517
我说真的
I mean, really.

839
00:55:16,566 --> 00:55:18,699
这附近有不少奇怪的家伙呢
There's some weird folks in this neighborhood.

840
00:55:18,778 --> 00:55:20,645
你觉得这很好笑么？
Do you think this is a joke?

841
00:55:21,365 --> 00:55:23,965
你真的知道他让你冒着什么样的风险吗？
Do you have any idea what he's asking you to risk?

842
00:55:23,967 --> 00:55:26,146
- 你有个女儿 - 我就是为了她才这么做的
- You have a daughter. - I'm doing this for her.

843
00:55:26,238 --> 00:55:29,752
你知道么，我妈妈死后，他消失了整整两个礼拜
You know when my mother died I didn't see him for two weeks?

844
00:55:29,881 --> 00:55:30,948
他那时很悲痛
He was in grief.

845
00:55:31,118 --> 00:55:32,651
我也悲痛啊，我才七岁啊
Yeah, so was I, and I was seven.

846
00:55:32,702 --> 00:55:35,335
然后他再也没回来过，原本的那个人也不见了
And he never came back, not in any way that counted.

847
00:55:36,014 --> 00:55:38,614
他就这么把我送进了寄宿学校
He just sent me off to boarding school.

848
00:55:39,621 --> 00:55:40,955
你知道么，有时候我觉得
You know, I thought,

849
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:42,867
在这种危急关头的时候
with all that's at stake,

850
00:55:42,868 --> 00:55:45,894
也许，我们能够借机和好如初
just maybe we might have a chance of making peace.

851
00:55:45,900 --> 00:55:48,133
但直到现在他一直都把我排除在外
But even now he still wants to shut me out.

852
00:55:48,170 --> 00:55:49,903
他并不想把你排除在外啊
He doesn't want to shut you out.

853
00:55:49,987 --> 00:55:51,787
- 他信任你 - 那为什么你会在这儿
- He trusts you. - Then why are you here?

854
00:55:52,789 --> 00:55:53,789
这恰恰证明了他爱你
It proves that he loves you.

855
00:55:56,059 --> 00:55:57,792
霍普，你听我说
Hope. Look at me.

856
00:55:59,147 --> 00:56:00,647
我就是个炮灰啊
I'm expendable.

857
00:56:01,630 --> 00:56:02,963
这就是为什么我在这儿
That's why I'm here.

858
00:56:04,327 --> 00:56:06,730
你必须要明白这件事
You must've realized that by now.

859
00:56:06,868 --> 00:56:10,268
我是说，这就是为什么我要去穿那件制服，而你不用
I mean, that's why I'm in the suit and you're not.

860
00:56:10,756 --> 00:56:14,263
因为他宁可输掉这场战斗，也不愿意失去你啊
He'd rather lose this fight than lose you.

861
00:56:15,406 --> 00:56:16,406
就是这样
Anyway.

862
00:56:17,773 --> 00:56:24,461
其实，我当时叫警察抓你的时候并不知道你还有个女儿
You know, I didn't know you had a daughter when I called the cops on you.

863
00:56:27,238 --> 00:56:28,805
她叫什么名字
What's her name?

864
00:56:29,092 --> 00:56:30,592
凯茜
Cassie.

865
00:56:31,436 --> 00:56:33,203
真是个好听的名字
It's a pretty name.

866
00:56:36,312 --> 00:56:37,845
你得清空杂念，斯科特
You have to clear your mind, Scott.

867
00:56:37,847 --> 00:56:41,152
你得精确地表达你的想法，这样才能行
You have to make your thoughts precise, that's how it works.

868
00:56:42,421 --> 00:56:44,065
想想凯茜吧
Think about Cassie,

869
00:56:44,071 --> 00:56:47,977
想想你有多希望能见到她，就像那种程度一样
about how badly you want to see her, and use that to focus.

870
00:56:56,424 --> 00:57:01,304
然后睁开眼睛，脑子里去想你要让蚂蚁们做的事
Open your eyes and just think about what you want the ants to do.

871
00:57:23,605 --> 00:57:24,995
非常棒
That's good.

872
00:57:42,970 --> 00:57:48,721
你妈妈说服了我让她加入任务
Your mother convinced me to let her join me on my missions.

873
00:57:48,874 --> 00:57:51,704
他们叫她黄蜂女
They called her the Wasp.

874
00:57:51,707 --> 00:57:53,965
她简直就是天生的
She was born to it.

875
00:57:55,353 --> 00:58:02,153
可是往后的日子里，我每天都在后悔当初为什么答应她
And there's not a day that goes by that I don't regret having said yes.

876
00:58:05,859 --> 00:58:07,359
那是在1987年
It was 1987.

877
00:58:08,410 --> 00:58:13,210
一批分裂分子在库尔斯克劫持了一个苏联的导弹发射井
Separatists had hijacked a Soviet missile silo in Kursk

878
00:58:14,246 --> 00:58:17,546
然后往美国发射了一枚洲际弹道导弹
and launched an ICBM at the United States.

879
00:58:24,750 --> 00:58:27,783
能够进入导弹内部的唯一方法
The only way to the internal mechanics

880
00:58:27,842 --> 00:58:30,142
就是穿过坚固的钛金属
was through solid titanium.

881
00:58:38,701 --> 00:58:43,534
我知道我必须要缩小到可以通过分子间隙才能关掉导弹
I knew I had to shrink between the molecules to disarm the missile,

882
00:58:43,615 --> 00:58:47,832
但是我的控制器被损坏的很严重
but my regulator had sustained too much damage.

883
00:58:49,140 --> 00:58:52,453
你妈妈她一点都没有犹豫
Your mother, she didn't hesitate.

884
00:58:53,964 --> 00:58:55,836
珍妮特！不！！！
Janet! No!!!

885
00:59:02,317 --> 00:59:04,603
她关掉了她的控制器
She turned off her regulator

886
00:59:05,505 --> 00:59:07,847
进入了亚原子态
and went sub-atomic

887
00:59:08,841 --> 00:59:11,374
然后关掉了那个炸弹
to deactivate the bomb.

888
00:59:12,379 --> 00:59:14,524
她就这么走了
She was gone.

889
00:59:18,747 --> 00:59:21,647
你妈妈是像英雄一样死去的
Your mom died a hero.

890
00:59:22,787 --> 00:59:28,294
之后的十年里，我竭尽了全力
And I spent the next ten years trying to learn all I could

891
00:59:28,467 --> 00:59:31,241
去了解关于量子领域的一切
about the quantum realm.

892
00:59:34,420 --> 00:59:36,687
你想要把她救回来
You were trying to bring her back.

893
00:59:37,765 --> 00:59:41,765
但我得到的唯一结论，就是我们什么都不知道
But all I learned was we know nothing.

894
00:59:46,327 --> 00:59:47,660
这不是你的错
It's not your fault.

895
00:59:50,122 --> 00:59:51,655
她做出了她的选择
She made her choice.

896
00:59:57,110 --> 01:00:00,443
可是你为什么不早点告诉我这一切？
But why didn't you tell me this sooner?

897
01:00:01,137 --> 01:00:04,560
我只想要去保护你
I was trying to protect you.

898
01:00:05,848 --> 01:00:07,584
我已经失去了你的母亲
I lost your mother.

899
01:00:09,474 --> 01:00:12,174
我不想连你也一起失去
I didn't mean to lose you too.

900
01:00:13,364 --> 01:00:14,364
我真的很抱歉
I'm sorry.

901
01:00:17,657 --> 01:00:19,670
这真是太酷了
This is awesome.

902
01:00:20,245 --> 01:00:22,382
太酷了，你们看
It's awesome. Y'know.

903
01:00:22,398 --> 01:00:24,897
你们终于放下心结，平复了内心的创伤
You guys are breaking down walls, you're healing.

904
01:00:25,274 --> 01:00:26,274
这是很重要的
It's important.

905
01:00:29,921 --> 01:00:31,304
我把气氛全给毁了是吧
I ruined the moment didn't I.

906
01:00:31,328 --> 01:00:32,778
完全的，你也知道啊
Yes, you did, yes.

907
01:00:34,096 --> 01:00:35,896
那我还是去泡点茶好了
I'm going to make some tea.

908
01:00:41,758 --> 01:00:42,835
搞定！
Nailed it!

909
01:00:51,945 --> 01:00:54,178
你真是个好孩子，安东尼
That's a good boy, Antony.

910
01:01:23,223 --> 01:01:26,556
训练的最后一步是要教你怎样隐身侵入
The final phase of your training will be a stealth incursion.

911
01:01:26,629 --> 01:01:27,596
冻死我了！
It's freezing!

912
01:01:27,601 --> 01:01:30,401
你就不能加个法兰绒的里衬吗
You couldn't make a simple flannel lining?

913
01:01:30,690 --> 01:01:34,090
我们必须得取回那个信号干扰器的原型机
We must retrieve this prototype of a signal decoy,

914
01:01:34,094 --> 01:01:36,893
那是我还在神盾局的时候发明的一个装置
it's a device that I invented during my SHIELD days.

915
01:01:36,895 --> 01:01:41,662
我们需要用它去抵消那些克罗斯装在厂房里的信号阻断装置
We need it to counteract the transmission blockers that Cross installed in the Futures vault.

916
01:01:41,757 --> 01:01:45,424
那东西现在应该封存在霍华德·斯塔克的一个旧仓库里
It's currently collecting dust in one of Howard Stark's old storage facilities

917
01:01:45,443 --> 01:01:46,776
位于纽约的北部
in upstate New York.

918
01:01:47,009 --> 01:01:49,042
应该是小菜一碟
Should be a piece of cake.

919
01:01:49,179 --> 01:01:50,646
你已经到达目标上空了
You're over the target area.

920
01:01:50,705 --> 01:01:52,872
现在就解除连接，斯科特
Disengage, now, Scott.

921
01:01:53,345 --> 01:01:54,345
A小分队，出动
Squadron A, go.

922
01:01:54,983 --> 01:01:55,983
B小分队，出动
B, go.

923
01:01:57,989 --> 01:01:58,989
C小分队，出动
C, go.

924
01:02:00,494 --> 01:02:02,694
好了，安东尼，这次可别再把我扔下去了
All right, Antony, please don't drop me this time.

925
01:02:03,792 --> 01:02:06,525
从方糖块儿到这个，感觉真是一个巨大的飞跃呢
Ah, it feels like a big leap from sugar cubes to this.

926
01:02:06,608 --> 01:02:07,728
冷静
Stay calm.

927
01:02:09,977 --> 01:02:11,910
额，各位，我们可能有麻烦
Uh, guys, we might have a problem.

928
01:02:11,978 --> 01:02:15,111
汉克，你不是说只是个旧仓库吗
Hank, didn't you say this was some old warehouse?

929
01:02:15,294 --> 01:02:16,294
根本不是啊
It's not!

930
01:02:17,462 --> 01:02:18,729
你这个老伙计
You son of a bitch!

931
01:02:21,943 --> 01:02:25,076
- 斯科特，快离开那里 - 终止行动！马上！
- Scott, get out of there. - Abort! Abort now.

932
01:02:25,080 --> 01:02:27,870
不，没事，看起来这里并没有人啊
No, it's okay. It doesn't look like anyone's home.

933
01:02:27,942 --> 01:02:29,742
安东尼，带我到屋顶上去
Antony, get me to the roof.

934
01:02:30,457 --> 01:02:31,924
他会把制服搞丢的
He's gonna lose the suit.

935
01:02:31,944 --> 01:02:33,611
他会没命的！
He's gonna lose his life.

936
01:02:39,126 --> 01:02:42,460
好啦，我现在在目标建筑的屋顶上了
All right I'm on the roof of the target building.

937
01:02:42,685 --> 01:02:43,718
有人来了，斯科特
Somebody's home, Scott.

938
01:02:47,512 --> 01:02:48,759
那里出什么事了，萨姆
What's going on down there, Sam?

939
01:02:48,732 --> 01:02:49,810
是猎鹰！
It's the Falcon!

940
01:02:50,203 --> 01:02:53,169
有警报被触发了，可我什么也没发现
I had a sensor trip but I'm not seeing anything.

941
01:02:53,235 --> 01:02:54,241
等一下
Wait a second.

942
01:02:54,252 --> 01:02:56,352
放弃，斯科特，马上终止行动
Abort Scott, abort now.

943
01:02:56,355 --> 01:02:57,982
没事拉，他看不见我
It's okay. He can't see me.

944
01:02:57,988 --> 01:02:59,168
我看见你了
I can see you.

945
01:02:59,176 --> 01:03:00,206
他看得见我
He can see me.

946
01:03:02,247 --> 01:03:04,850
嗨，我是斯科特
Hi. I'm Scott.

947
01:03:04,853 --> 01:03:06,364
他刚说“嗨我是斯科特”了？！
Did he just say "Hi I'm Scott?"

948
01:03:06,355 --> 01:03:07,115
你在这里干什么
What are you doing here?

949
01:03:07,116 --> 01:03:08,005
首先，
First off,

950
01:03:08,044 --> 01:03:09,634
我是你的超级粉丝
I'm a big fan.

951
01:03:09,635 --> 01:03:11,714
谢了，那么你到底是谁啊？
'Preciate it. So who the hell are you?

952
01:03:12,046 --> 01:03:13,306
我是蚁人
I'm Ant-Man.

953
01:03:13,796 --> 01:03:14,657
蚁人？
Ant-Man?

954
01:03:14,659 --> 01:03:16,594
啥？你没听说过我吗？
What, you haven't heard of me?

955
01:03:16,835 --> 01:03:19,168
好吧你应该是没听说过
Nah, you wouldn't have heard of me.

956
01:03:19,269 --> 01:03:20,436
你准备告诉我你要来干什么吗？
You want to tell me what you want?

957
01:03:20,441 --> 01:03:22,931
我是想来拿走一样高科技的
I was hoping I could grab a piece of technology

958
01:03:22,941 --> 01:03:24,644
就用几天，然后就还回来
just for a few days, I'm gonna return it.

959
01:03:24,651 --> 01:03:27,381
我需要用它拯救世界，你懂我的意思
I need it to save the world. You know how that is.

960
01:03:27,385 --> 01:03:29,085
别跟我扯拯救世界
I know exactly how that is.

961
01:03:29,138 --> 01:03:31,305
定位入侵者位置，送他进去
Located the breach. Bringing him in.

962
01:03:31,310 --> 01:03:32,443
我很抱歉要这么做
Sorry about this.

963
01:03:36,351 --> 01:03:38,606
你这是想要干什么啊？
What the hell are you doing?

964
01:03:41,062 --> 01:03:45,129
入侵者是一名成年男子，他具有某种缩小的技术
Breach is an adult male who has some sort of shrinking tech.

965
01:03:57,433 --> 01:03:58,433
对不起
Sorry.

966
01:03:58,843 --> 01:04:00,443
听着，我真的很抱歉这么做，对不起
Look, I'm sorry about this, sorry.

967
01:04:01,244 --> 01:04:02,344
够了！
That's enough!

968
01:04:25,094 --> 01:04:26,604
安东尼，帮我下
Antony, a little help.

969
01:04:39,182 --> 01:04:40,327
我没有影像了
I've lost visual.

970
01:04:49,273 --> 01:04:50,606
他在我的背包里
He's inside my pack.

971
01:04:50,659 --> 01:04:51,659
抱歉
Sorry.

972
01:04:53,314 --> 01:04:55,514
你真的是个好人
You seem like a really great guy.

973
01:05:20,091 --> 01:05:23,924
请千万不要告诉队长这件事，这对我很重要
It's really important to me that Cap never finds out about this.

974
01:05:26,902 --> 01:05:30,254
那是完全不负责任的，危险的行为
That was completely irresponsible and dangerous.

975
01:05:31,182 --> 01:05:33,370
你破坏了整个行动
You jeopardized everything.

976
01:05:49,548 --> 01:05:50,609
你拿到它了
You got it.

977
01:05:53,961 --> 01:05:54,961
干得不错
Well done.

978
01:05:54,975 --> 01:05:57,374
等等，你刚刚是夸我了吗？
Wait a minute. Did you just compliment me?

979
01:05:57,375 --> 01:05:58,375
他夸我了，对不对？
He did, didn't he?

980
01:05:58,467 --> 01:06:00,400
听起来像是那么回事
Kinda sounded like he did.

981
01:06:01,913 --> 01:06:03,313
我很棒的，是不是
I was good, wasn't I?

982
01:06:04,941 --> 01:06:08,241
那我呢，我跟一个复仇者打了一架，而且还没死
Hey, how about the fact that I fought an Avenger, and didn't die?

983
01:06:08,241 --> 01:06:10,374
别沉浸在这件事上了
Now let's not dwell on the past.

984
01:06:10,731 --> 01:06:12,664
我们还有计划要完成
We gotta finish our planning.

985
01:06:15,287 --> 01:06:16,287
别理他
Don't mind him.

986
01:06:17,408 --> 01:06:18,408
你做的很好
You did good.

987
01:06:26,087 --> 01:06:27,087
达伦！
Darren!

988
01:06:29,741 --> 01:06:31,807
你怎么跑进来了
How the hell'd you get in here?

989
01:06:32,364 --> 01:06:34,697
你忘关家门了啊，汉克
You left the front door open, Hank.

990
01:06:35,131 --> 01:06:37,897
看来没错，你老了
It's official. You're old.

991
01:06:37,915 --> 01:06:39,329
那个计划！
The plans!

992
01:06:40,754 --> 01:06:42,225
他会杀了他的
He will kill him.

993
01:06:45,526 --> 01:06:47,926
是什么风把你吹来了
Well to what do I owe this pleasure?

994
01:06:49,323 --> 01:06:50,894
我有个好消息
I have good news.

995
01:06:51,280 --> 01:06:52,179
是吗？
Really?

996
01:06:53,279 --> 01:06:53,985
什么好消息？
What's that?

997
01:06:54,551 --> 01:06:55,551
皮娒科技
Pym Tech,

998
01:06:56,537 --> 01:06:58,653
你创建这个的公司
the company you created,

999
01:06:58,927 --> 01:07:03,160
就要成为世界上最挣钱的企业之一了
is about to become one of the most profitable operations in the world.

1000
01:07:03,215 --> 01:07:06,882
我们预计仅明天就能签下价值150亿的订单
We're anticipating 15 billion in sales tomorrow alone.

1001
01:07:13,852 --> 01:07:14,852
不用谢我
You're welcome.

1002
01:07:19,106 --> 01:07:22,239
我知道这听起来很奇怪，但我希望你能在场
I know this is odd, but I'd like you to be there.

1003
01:07:22,299 --> 01:07:25,032
这是我的时刻，我想让你看见
This is my moment, I want you to see it.

1004
01:07:25,256 --> 01:07:26,822
当然了，达伦，是的，一定
Sure, Darren. Yeah, sure.

1005
01:07:26,907 --> 01:07:27,907
我会去的
I'll be there.

1006
01:07:45,328 --> 01:07:46,861
你看上我哪一点了？
What did you see in me?

1007
01:07:47,650 --> 01:07:49,450
我不明白你的意思
I don't know what you mean.

1008
01:07:50,289 --> 01:07:52,689
那么多年前，你选上了我
All those years ago, you picked me.

1009
01:07:53,062 --> 01:07:54,196
你从我身上看到什么了？
What did you see?

1010
01:07:56,820 --> 01:07:57,820
我看到了我自己
I saw myself.

1011
01:07:59,160 --> 01:08:00,902
那你为什么又将我拒之门外呢？
Then why did you push me away?

1012
01:08:03,360 --> 01:08:06,111
因为我看到了太多的我自己
Because I saw too much of myself.

1013
01:08:17,400 --> 01:08:20,401
他都知道了，他是在逗你上钩，我们得停止行动
He knows, he's baiting you. We have to call it off.

1014
01:08:20,402 --> 01:08:21,569
一切都有风险
We're all taking risks.

1015
01:08:21,635 --> 01:08:22,868
如果他看见我在这儿可怎么办
What if he saw me here?

1016
01:08:22,952 --> 01:08:24,185
他没看见你，不可能的
He didn't. There's no way.

1017
01:08:24,240 --> 01:08:26,284
你怎么知道不可能
How do you know that?

1018
01:08:34,522 --> 01:08:35,314
达伦，嘿
Darren, hi.

1019
01:08:35,928 --> 01:08:36,759
霍普
Hope.

1020
01:08:37,292 --> 01:08:38,601
你现在在哪呢
Where are you right now?

1021
01:08:39,354 --> 01:08:40,527
我在家呢，怎么啦？
I'm at home, why?

1022
01:08:40,691 --> 01:08:41,696
我刚去见了汉克
I just saw Hank.

1023
01:08:42,035 --> 01:08:44,070
他还是那样只会鄙视我
I still get nothing but contempt from him.

1024
01:08:44,112 --> 01:08:47,588
不要让他激怒你，他只是…只是个年迈的老人
Don't let him rile you up, he's just... he's a senile old man.

1025
01:08:47,805 --> 01:08:50,178
我们需要让所有人进入状态了
We need to start everyone working around the clock,

1026
01:08:50,180 --> 01:08:52,030
启动生产线并开始运行
get the assembly line up and running.

1027
01:08:52,075 --> 01:08:53,731
同时我要大幅加强安保
And I'm tripling security.

1028
01:08:53,971 --> 01:08:59,070
在所有入口设置探测器，外部空气通风口都要安装钢微孔筛网
Full sensors at all entrances, and exterior air vents fitted with steel micro mesh.

1029
01:08:59,123 --> 01:09:00,753
很好，好主意
Great. Good idea.

1030
01:09:00,763 --> 01:09:01,815
谢谢你，霍普
Thank you, hope.

1031
01:09:02,004 --> 01:09:04,404
我很幸运能有你站在我这边
I'm so lucky to have you on my team.

1032
01:09:07,664 --> 01:09:10,390
他要大幅加强安保，他已经失去理智了
He's tripling security, he's lost his mind,

1033
01:09:10,395 --> 01:09:12,008
他已经完全针对你了
and he's on to you.

1034
01:09:12,280 --> 01:09:14,193
但他还没有针对你
But he's not on to you.

1035
01:09:14,194 --> 01:09:18,441
他要在所有入口设立全身扫描安检，还关掉了所有通风口
He's adding full body scanners to all entrances and closing exterior vents.

1036
01:09:18,744 --> 01:09:20,723
我们要怎么把斯科特带进去？
How are we gonna get Scott inside?

1037
01:09:22,137 --> 01:09:23,363
主供水通道
The water main.

1038
01:09:24,369 --> 01:09:26,469
在主供水通道上是没法加装安保系统的
You can't add security to a water main.

1039
01:09:26,504 --> 01:09:30,216
水压太强了，但如果我们能想办法降低压力，我就可以进去
The pressure is too strong, but if we can decrease it, that's how I get in.

1040
01:09:30,234 --> 01:09:34,017
那得有人能接近建筑的主控室才能改变水压啊
Somebody would have to reach the building's control center to change the water pressure.

1041
01:09:34,022 --> 01:09:36,599
我是说，汉克和我会一直呆在克罗斯旁边，我们怎么可能办得到呢
I mean, Hank and I will be beside Cross, how are we supposed to do that?

1042
01:09:36,606 --> 01:09:38,293
所以我们要扩展队伍
So we expand our team.

1043
01:09:38,664 --> 01:09:39,731
要怎么做呢？
What do we need?

1044
01:09:39,772 --> 01:09:43,372
一个人冒充警卫做内应，关闭供水压力
A fake security guard on the inside to depressurize the water system,

1045
01:09:43,382 --> 01:09:46,782
另外一个得骇进主电源然后关掉激光网
somebody else to hack into the power supply and kill the laser grid,

1046
01:09:46,813 --> 01:09:48,013
最后还需要一个车手接应
and a getaway guy.

1047
01:09:48,798 --> 01:09:50,198
哦，不，不，不
No, no. No, no no.

1048
01:09:50,288 --> 01:09:52,922
不要那三个傻帽儿，绝对不行
Not those three wombats. No way.

1049
01:09:53,625 --> 01:09:55,324
谢谢您的咖啡，女士
Thank you for the coffee ma'am.

1050
01:09:55,379 --> 01:09:57,612
通常如果回到作案现场的话
It's not too often that you rob a place,

1051
01:09:57,650 --> 01:09:58,750
是不太会受到欢迎的
and then get welcomed back.

1052
01:09:58,838 --> 01:10:01,023
可是你在招待我们耶！
Because we just robbed you!

1053
01:10:02,432 --> 01:10:06,199
你知道他是因为偷刨冰机才被关起来的，对吧？
You know that he was arrested for stealing a smoothie machine, right?

1054
01:10:06,234 --> 01:10:07,501
我偷了两台刨冰机
Two smoothie machines.

1055
01:10:07,582 --> 01:10:08,849
你确定他们能行么？
Are you sure they can handle this?

1056
01:10:08,927 --> 01:10:10,627
哦，我们肯定行，我们可专业了。
Oh we can handle it. We're professionals.

1057
01:10:10,663 --> 01:10:14,030
请原谅我们并没有对此充满信心
You'll forgive us if we're not instilled with confidence.

1058
01:10:14,114 --> 01:10:16,981
等等，大家先不要激动啊，各位
Wait, everybody, just kick back and relax a little bit, man,

1059
01:10:17,028 --> 01:10:18,427
我们很熟悉业务的
we know our business.

1060
01:10:18,457 --> 01:10:20,957
连这间高科技住宅我们都溜进来了不是吗
We broke into this spooky-ass house, didn't we?

1061
01:10:20,964 --> 01:10:21,964
那是因为我让你进来的
I let you.

1062
01:10:22,174 --> 01:10:25,040
我也可以说是我让你让我嘛
Well, one could say that I let you let me.

1063
01:10:25,695 --> 01:10:27,995
各位，可以了，他们能行的
Look, it's okay. They can handle this.

1064
01:10:28,076 --> 01:10:29,043
可不是，我们能行的
Yeah, we can handle it.

1065
01:10:29,098 --> 01:10:29,931
你搞定他们的身份信息了吗？
You got their credentials?

1066
01:10:29,974 --> 01:10:30,841
他已经在系统里了
He's in the system.

1067
01:10:30,924 --> 01:10:32,124
我在系统里了？
I'm in the system?

1068
01:10:32,586 --> 01:10:33,586
在系统里啦！
You're in the system!

1069
01:10:33,863 --> 01:10:34,863
系统耶！
The system?

1070
01:10:34,871 --> 01:10:37,137
得了，我们算是完蛋了
Yeah. We're doomed.

1071
01:10:37,149 --> 01:10:40,349
好了，有件事我得先让你们看看
All right, there's something you guys need to see.

1072
01:10:40,359 --> 01:10:44,825
当你走到这里时，在你的左侧会有三个办公室
When you get to this corner, there's gonna be three offices on your left side.

1073
01:10:44,911 --> 01:10:45,911
我靠！
Damn!

1074
01:10:47,506 --> 01:10:50,419
哇哦！这很酷啊，哥们儿！
Whoa! That's so cool, bro!

1075
01:10:50,520 --> 01:10:51,632
好了听着
Now look,

1076
01:10:51,788 --> 01:10:55,154
接下来会有些诡异了，可能会有点吓人，但绝对安全
this is gonna get weird, all right. It's pretty freaky but it's safe.

1077
01:10:55,210 --> 01:10:56,477
你们完全不用害怕
There's no reason to be scared.

1078
01:10:56,486 --> 01:10:58,286
呵，哥我啥都不怕
Aw, no no daddy don't get scared.

1079
01:10:58,400 --> 01:10:58,900
是么？
Really?

1080
01:10:58,966 --> 01:10:59,566
当然了
Yeah.

1081
01:10:59,797 --> 01:11:00,597
太好了
Good.

1082
01:11:05,235 --> 01:11:06,235
喔！
Oh!

1083
01:11:08,001 --> 01:11:10,134
这…这是那种…吉普赛人用的
This is the work of the gypsies.

1084
01:11:10,236 --> 01:11:11,203
这是，这是巫术！
That's, that's, that's witchcraft.

1085
01:11:11,252 --> 01:11:12,519
哇，太神奇了
Oh, that's amazing.

1086
01:11:13,210 --> 01:11:14,777
简直就是大卫·科波菲尔搞的那套
That's like some David Copperfield shit.

1087
01:11:14,824 --> 01:11:16,691
- 这肯定是某种巫术 - 用…用的魔法！
- That's some kind of wizardry. - Sorcery!

1088
01:11:16,959 --> 01:11:18,026
你是怎么做到的，兄弟？
How'd you do that bro?

1089
01:11:18,043 --> 01:11:20,643
别崩溃，往你肩膀上看
Don't freak out. Look at your shoulder.

1090
01:11:20,703 --> 01:11:23,703
啊啊啊！啊啊啊！下去！下去！快走！走！
Ahh!!  Ahh!!! Get off!  Get off, go go...

1091
01:11:24,014 --> 01:11:26,281
你不是说“哥我啥都不怕”的吗！
Wait, I thought daddy didn't get scared?

1092
01:11:28,333 --> 01:11:32,399
我给他们一人吃了半片安定，然后汉克开始解释制服的工作原理
I gave them each half a Xanax and Hank explained the science of the suit to them.

1093
01:11:32,444 --> 01:11:33,977
立刻就全睡过去了
Fell right asleep.

1094
01:11:35,425 --> 01:11:37,558
嘿，听着，我想谢谢你为了…
Hey, look. I want to thank you for-

1095
01:11:37,655 --> 01:11:38,788
别，不要谢我
No, please don't.

1096
01:11:40,026 --> 01:11:42,560
我们这样做都是为了那个更伟大的目标，这和个人无关
We're all doing this for reasons much bigger than any one of us.

1097
01:11:42,562 --> 01:11:46,495
我只是很高兴你能为整个计划贡献那一点点的力量
I'm just glad that you might have a slight chance of maybe pulling this off.

1098
01:11:46,516 --> 01:11:48,183
哈哈，谢谢你，为了
Hey. Thank you, you know,

1099
01:11:48,556 --> 01:11:49,856
为了你给我的那些鼓励
for that pep talk.

1100
01:11:49,914 --> 01:11:53,980
而事实真相就是，我已经从一开始的鄙视你，变得现在甚至有点喜欢你了呢
You know, the honest truth is I actually went from despising you to almost liking you.

1101
01:11:53,984 --> 01:11:56,051
你真应该去写鸡汤文
You really should write poetry.

1102
01:11:58,529 --> 01:12:00,429
早点休息吧，斯科特
Get some sleep Scott.

1103
01:12:51,138 --> 01:12:54,271
好啦，都准备好了，大家都知道自己应该干什么吧？
All right, just so we're clear, everyone here knows their role, right?

1104
01:12:54,332 --> 01:12:54,932
戴夫？
Dave?

1105
01:12:54,962 --> 01:12:55,862
车交给我了
Wheels on the ground.

1106
01:12:55,940 --> 01:12:56,440
科特？
Kurt?

1107
01:12:56,498 --> 01:12:57,365
情报交给我了
Eyes in the sky.

1108
01:12:57,454 --> 01:12:57,854
阿毛？
Luis?

1109
01:12:57,893 --> 01:13:00,126
噢，伙计，你懂的，哥我这就去找件制服穿上
Aw, man, you know it, you know what, I get to wear a uniform,

1110
01:13:00,188 --> 01:13:01,188
就这么定了
that's what's up.

1111
01:13:01,238 --> 01:13:01,838
阿毛！
Luis.

1112
01:13:01,905 --> 01:13:04,404
对不起，我错了，我知道该干什么就是有点兴奋，而且
I'm sorry, I mean, I'm good, I'm good, I'm just excited, and plus

1113
01:13:04,462 --> 01:13:07,062
你女朋友实在是太正点了，有美女在旁边我就紧张
you're girlfriend's really hot, so you know that makes me nervous too,

1114
01:13:07,126 --> 01:13:08,126
您真的好漂亮，女士
and you are very beautiful ma'am.

1115
01:13:08,186 --> 01:13:09,186
我的天哪
Oh my lord.

1116
01:13:09,217 --> 01:13:09,617
她并不是我的女…
She's not my-

1117
01:13:09,677 --> 01:13:12,544
嘿，还有，我觉得既然我要去当卧底了，我得想点计策
Hey, you know what, I was thinking of a tactic, like when I go undercover,

1118
01:13:12,579 --> 01:13:14,779
比如吹个口哨什么的，可以让我的角色更真实什么的
like a whistling, y'know I' saying, to like, blend in.

1119
01:13:14,917 --> 01:13:16,317
不要，别吹口哨
No. Don't whistle.

1120
01:13:16,437 --> 01:13:18,670
吹什么口哨，你又不是去表演
No whistling, it's not the Andy Griffith Show.

1121
01:13:18,679 --> 01:13:19,679
不许吹口哨
No whistling.

1122
01:13:37,468 --> 01:13:38,868
一区一切正常
All clear in sector one.

1123
01:13:44,185 --> 01:13:45,185
往前走
Step up.

1124
01:13:48,026 --> 01:13:49,026
可以了
All clear.

1125
01:13:54,544 --> 01:13:55,544
我们到位了
We're set.

1126
01:13:55,714 --> 01:13:56,714
祝我好运吧
Wish me luck.

1127
01:14:09,451 --> 01:14:10,451
设备已经就绪了
Utilities online.

1128
01:14:11,256 --> 01:14:13,390
(whistling "It's a Small World")

1129
01:14:23,332 --> 01:14:24,932
嘿，你在这儿干嘛
Hey. What are you doing?

1130
01:14:25,342 --> 01:14:29,666
呃，头儿说让我检查这个地方，我在检查咯
Uh, boss-man said to secure the area, so, I'm securing.

1131
01:14:31,625 --> 01:14:32,625
我就是头儿
I'm the boss.

1132
01:14:33,140 --> 01:14:34,140
喔！
Oh!

1133
01:14:34,246 --> 01:14:35,246
这里是设备间第3…
Utilities work room 3-

1134
01:14:48,801 --> 01:14:50,401
水位正在下降中
Water level is dropping.

1135
01:15:10,018 --> 01:15:11,018
喔哦！
Whoa!

1136
01:15:19,328 --> 01:15:21,261
正在从排气管里出来
Coming up on extraction pipe.

1137
01:15:21,967 --> 01:15:22,967
我看到了
I see it!

1138
01:15:30,379 --> 01:15:31,712
好了，来吧，我得上到上面去
All right, come on, I gotta get up there,

1139
01:15:31,769 --> 01:15:33,902
就这样，就这样伙计们，好的
that's it, that's it guys, yes!

1140
01:15:34,178 --> 01:15:35,378
就这样，好
That's it, yeah...

1141
01:15:36,950 --> 01:15:38,483
好极了，你们做到了
Yes! You got it!

1142
01:15:38,832 --> 01:15:40,165
真是太棒了，加油
You got it, come on!

1143
01:15:44,912 --> 01:15:46,779
好的，安东尼，我们起飞吧
All right, let's fly Antony.

1144
01:15:57,434 --> 01:15:59,501
蚁人已经成功入侵了
The Ant-Man is in the building.

1145
01:16:04,192 --> 01:16:07,125
嘘！前面那儿有辆福特皇冠
Pshhh. Got a Crown Vic right outside a'heah.

1146
01:16:07,210 --> 01:16:07,777
所以有什么问题么？
This is problem?

1147
01:16:07,833 --> 01:16:11,633
你不知道开福特皇冠基本都是警察卧底吗？
Considering that Crown Vics are the most commonly used car for under-cover cops, man,

1148
01:16:11,971 --> 01:16:13,503
嗯，的确是个问题
yes, this is a problem.

1149
01:16:16,833 --> 01:16:17,833
是皮姆
It's Pym.

1150
01:16:21,342 --> 01:16:22,342
哦，不
Oh, no.

1151
01:16:22,611 --> 01:16:23,711
我准备派子弹蚁出动了
I'm deploying the bullet ants.

1152
01:16:23,806 --> 01:16:25,618
（他是想说Paraponera clavata也就是子弹蚁的拉丁名）
哈帕内拉克莱那…玛莱那…玛…
Hapanera-clairna-mairna-mairna.

1153
01:16:25,619 --> 01:16:29,819
（他是想说Paraponera clavata也就是子弹蚁的拉丁名）
虽然学名是怎么拼我给忘了，但我确定下面这位要倒大霉了
I don't remember what it's called but I feel bad for this guy.

1154
01:16:30,050 --> 01:16:31,250
嘿，你好吗
What's up man.

1155
01:16:36,390 --> 01:16:37,689
嗷！嗷！！
Ow! Ow!!

1156
01:16:40,987 --> 01:16:44,420
看，这就是我说过的那种，我管这叫一个不幸的意外
See, that's what I'm talkin' bout, that's what I call it, an unfortunate casualty,

1157
01:16:44,500 --> 01:16:46,367
在一个很正经的行动中的…
in a very serious operation.

1158
01:16:56,102 --> 01:16:57,569
信号干扰器已就位
Signal decoy in place.

1159
01:16:57,975 --> 01:17:00,175
恶毒美女干得不错嘛，斯科特
Mean pretty lady did good, Scott.

1160
01:17:02,429 --> 01:17:04,196
看起来警察好像要抓皮姆
Looks like Pym's getting arrested.

1161
01:17:04,220 --> 01:17:05,653
斯科特，我们有麻烦了
Scott, we have problem.

1162
01:17:05,671 --> 01:17:07,538
麻烦？有什么麻烦？
Problem? What's the problem?

1163
01:17:08,767 --> 01:17:11,134
戴夫！戴夫，我们不是那么计划的！
Dave! Dave, that's not part of plan!

1164
01:17:11,163 --> 01:17:12,163
听我说
Listen to me.

1165
01:17:12,445 --> 01:17:16,345
如果你们不让我进去，会有很多人因此死掉的
If I don't get into this building people will die.

1166
01:17:17,357 --> 01:17:18,957
这个故事编的太差劲了
That's awfully dramatic.

1167
01:17:21,759 --> 01:17:23,025
你玩儿我呢吗？
Are you kidding me?

1168
01:17:25,518 --> 01:17:26,518
蛤蛤蛤！
Ha ha ha!

1169
01:17:27,272 --> 01:17:28,772
问题解决了
Problem solved.

1170
01:17:44,092 --> 01:17:45,092
好吧
Well.

1171
01:17:47,157 --> 01:17:48,157
我看起来如何？
How do I look?

1172
01:17:58,591 --> 01:17:59,591
在这儿呢
There he is.

1173
01:18:01,238 --> 01:18:02,238
时间刚好
Just in time.

1174
01:18:02,686 --> 01:18:03,686
来吧
Come on.

1175
01:18:13,628 --> 01:18:15,261
十二处验证中
Twelve point verification.

1176
01:18:15,347 --> 01:18:17,447
有点夸张了吧，不是么达伦
Little over the top, don't you think Darren?

1177
01:18:17,513 --> 01:18:18,680
确认授权中
Confirming authorization.

1178
01:18:18,718 --> 01:18:20,651
安全永远第一吗
No you can never be too safe.

1179
01:18:20,725 --> 01:18:21,725
访问已允许
Access granted.

1180
01:18:29,149 --> 01:18:32,682
看来我可以把一切交给你了，达伦，你做的很棒
I gotta hand it to you, Darren, you really did it.

1181
01:18:33,244 --> 01:18:35,909
你只看到了一半而已，汉克
And you only know the half of it, Hank.

1182
01:19:01,391 --> 01:19:03,258
到达第二个目标点
Arriving at second position.

1183
01:19:04,638 --> 01:19:06,504
好的，全速前进安东尼，出发
All right, top speed, Antony. Let's go.

1184
01:19:17,808 --> 01:19:19,874
正在靠近最终目标处
Proceeding to command position.

1185
01:19:36,920 --> 01:19:37,920
我马上回来，安东尼
I'll be right back Antony.

1186
01:19:40,730 --> 01:19:42,730
好了伙计们，我到位了
All right guys, I'm in position.

1187
01:19:42,738 --> 01:19:44,671
我准备操控蚂蚁了
I'm going to signal the ants.

1188
01:19:44,936 --> 01:19:45,936
噢，不不不！
No no nooo.

1189
01:19:47,894 --> 01:19:50,127
你看见了吧？蛤蛤蛤蛤！
Did you see that? Ha ha ha, ha ha!

1190
01:19:55,174 --> 01:19:56,307
组成阵型
Assume formation.

1191
01:19:57,266 --> 01:19:59,033
好了，可爱的小疯子们
All right you cute little crazies,

1192
01:19:59,054 --> 01:20:00,654
烧了这些服务器吧
let's fry these servers.

1193
01:20:13,355 --> 01:20:14,822
现在去拿那个吧，伙计
Let's go get it buddy!

1194
01:20:25,262 --> 01:20:26,262
喔哈！
Whoo-haa!

1195
01:20:27,562 --> 01:20:30,895
服务器已经完了，所有数据备份都被清除了
Servers are fried. Data backup completely erased.

1196
01:20:31,146 --> 01:20:33,213
已经在去展示舱的路上了
Heading to the particle chamber.

1197
01:20:39,271 --> 01:20:41,037
你好，克罗斯博士
Hello Dr. Cross.

1198
01:20:45,040 --> 01:20:47,307
我的合伙人已经同意了你的条款
My associates have agreed to your terms.

1199
01:20:47,672 --> 01:20:48,672
太好了
Wonderful.

1200
01:20:48,795 --> 01:20:51,362
卡森先生向我介绍了这几位杰出的绅士
Mr. Carson introduced me to these fine gentlemen here,

1201
01:20:51,452 --> 01:20:53,152
他们是九头蛇的代表
they're representatives of Hydra.

1202
01:20:53,186 --> 01:20:54,786
他们和原来的已经不同了
They're not what they were.

1203
01:20:54,822 --> 01:20:56,622
现在正在做些很有意思的工作
They're doing some interesting work.

1204
01:20:57,165 --> 01:20:58,764
而我很享受这一刻
And I'm enjoying myself.

1205
01:21:00,613 --> 01:21:06,413
你一直不告诉我的你的那些技术，现在我就要全扔你脸上了
You tried to hide your technology from me, and now it's going to blow up in your face.

1206
01:21:08,420 --> 01:21:09,420
哇哦
Wow.

1207
01:21:10,211 --> 01:21:11,211
哇哦！
Wow!

1208
01:21:12,222 --> 01:21:14,189
我是说，我早就知道你会给我这一拳
I mean, I saw the punch coming a mile away

1209
01:21:14,201 --> 01:21:16,234
但我本以为会又弱又可怜呢
but I just figured it'd be all pathetic and weak.

1210
01:21:16,299 --> 01:21:17,832
那你是想错了
Well you figured wrong.

1211
01:21:18,762 --> 01:21:19,829
我见过这个货车
I know this van.

1212
01:21:21,916 --> 01:21:22,915
里面有人吗？
Anybody home?

1213
01:21:23,016 --> 01:21:23,916
- 嘘 - 嘘
- Shh. - Shh.

1214
01:21:24,259 --> 01:21:25,259
- 嘘！ - 嘘！
-Shh! -Shh!!

1215
01:21:28,158 --> 01:21:29,758
好了伙计们，我到了
All right guys I'm here.

1216
01:21:34,500 --> 01:21:35,833
炸药已经激活了
Setting the charges.

1217
01:21:54,729 --> 01:21:57,396
干的很棒各位，我就在这儿跟你们分手了
Great job guys. I'll take it from here.

1218
01:22:07,085 --> 01:22:08,085
好孩子，安东尼
Good boy Antony.

1219
01:22:10,792 --> 01:22:11,792
到达最终目标地点
Final position.

1220
01:22:20,062 --> 01:22:22,395
伙计们，那个激光网怎么样了？
Guys? How we lookin' on that laser grid?

1221
01:22:22,538 --> 01:22:24,038
- 差不多了 - 差得远呢
- Almost! - No you're not.

1222
01:22:24,115 --> 01:22:26,648
- 马上就好了！ - 根本不是
- I'm getting close! - No you're not.

1223
01:22:30,246 --> 01:22:32,513
旧金山警察局！里面的人听着！
San Francisco PD! Man in the van!

1224
01:22:33,385 --> 01:22:34,618
我知道你们在里面！
I know you're in there!

1225
01:22:34,651 --> 01:22:36,751
- 让它走快点 - 哥们，你是认真的吗？
- Make it go faster. - Dude. Seriously.

1226
01:22:42,425 --> 01:22:44,625
我准备跳了，你收到了吗科特
Ready to jump. Do you read Kurt?

1227
01:22:45,094 --> 01:22:46,294
就差一点了
So close.

1228
01:22:46,405 --> 01:22:47,805
- 别动！ - 是，等一下，等一下
- Freeze! - Okay, wait a minute wait a minute,

1229
01:22:47,854 --> 01:22:50,446
刚刚有个和我特别像的黑人攻击了我们
there was a black guy that looked exactly like me who attacked us

1230
01:22:50,449 --> 01:22:52,034
然后把我们关在了这个恶心的货车里
and put us in the back of this disgusting van.

1231
01:22:52,034 --> 01:22:54,574
- 给我出来 - 哦，别这样
- Get out. - Take it easy!

1232
01:22:54,680 --> 01:22:56,603
现在去吧！
Go now!

1233
01:22:59,331 --> 01:23:02,208
- 等等！ - 什么？你说等等是什么意思？
- Wait! - What? What d'you mean wait?

1234
01:23:11,835 --> 01:23:13,135
什么？什么？
What? What?

1235
01:23:14,568 --> 01:23:15,568
嘿，我说
Hello guy.

1236
01:23:28,495 --> 01:23:31,696
我早就怀疑你在什么地方藏了一套制服
I always suspected you had a suit stored away somewhere,

1237
01:23:31,697 --> 01:23:35,252
那么现在的问题就是，这位新蚁人是谁呢？
which begs the question, who is the new Ant-Man?

1238
01:23:35,348 --> 01:23:39,681
我敬爱的导师比起我来更信任的这个人，是谁呢？
Who is the man that my beloved mentor trusted even more than me?

1239
01:23:41,385 --> 01:23:44,185
斯科特·朗
Scott Lang.

1240
01:23:45,033 --> 01:23:46,753
可怜的家伙
The martyr

1241
01:23:46,771 --> 01:23:49,611
他为他的行为付出了代价
who took on the system and paid the price,

1242
01:23:49,614 --> 01:23:53,397
家已经毁了，唯一的女儿也离他而去
losing his family and his only daughter in the process,

1243
01:23:53,403 --> 01:23:56,283
跟你还真是像啊，汉克
exactly your kind of guy, Hank.

1244
01:23:57,591 --> 01:24:02,858
他没有留下任何痕迹就从监狱中逃跑了
He escapes his jail cell without leaving any clue as to how,

1245
01:24:02,861 --> 01:24:04,001
然后呢
and then,

1246
01:24:04,223 --> 01:24:06,423
就这样直接消失了
he disappears magically,

1247
01:24:07,222 --> 01:24:13,564
连值多少钱都还不知道呢，他就把这件蚁人制服送来了
despite having no money to his name, and now he brings me the Ant-Man suit,

1248
01:24:14,470 --> 01:24:18,522
这个唯一可以和我的作品媲美的东西
the only thing that can rival my creation.

1249
01:24:18,632 --> 01:24:21,574
达伦，不要这么做
Darren, don't do this.

1250
01:24:21,961 --> 01:24:25,705
如果你卖给这些人，这个世界会变得一团糟的
If you sell to these men, it's going to be chaos.

1251
01:24:25,709 --> 01:24:29,503
我已经卖了，而且多亏了你，卖了双倍的价钱呢
I already have, and for twice the price, thanks to you.

1252
01:24:30,636 --> 01:24:34,112
能溜进复仇者的机构中可是不简单呢
It's not easy to successfully infiltrate an Avengers facility.

1253
01:24:34,115 --> 01:24:36,515
幸亏这件事儿传得快
Thankfully, word travels fast.

1254
01:24:36,678 --> 01:24:41,078
哦，我只卖给了他们黄蜂装甲，粒子我可没给他们
Oh I'll sell them the Yellowjacket but I'm keeping the particle to myself.

1255
01:24:41,135 --> 01:24:42,602
那可是装甲的燃料
They don't run on diesel.

1256
01:24:42,644 --> 01:24:45,844
如果想使用装甲，就得来找我买燃料哦
If you want the fuel you'll have to come to me.

1257
01:24:46,721 --> 01:24:51,821
如果一个人可以控制世界上最具有力量的武器的话，那他就是？
What do you call the only man who can arm the most powerful weapon in the world?

1258
01:24:52,056 --> 01:24:54,763
世界上最有力量的人
The most powerful man in the world.

1259
01:24:54,976 --> 01:24:56,438
你为我骄傲了吗？
You proud of me yet?

1260
01:24:56,442 --> 01:24:59,828
你可以阻止这一切的，达伦，现在还不晚
You can stop this, Darren. It's not too late.

1261
01:24:59,834 --> 01:25:02,361
这一刻已经来的太迟了
It's been too late for a long time now.

1262
01:25:04,276 --> 01:25:05,146
达伦
Darren.

1263
01:25:07,367 --> 01:25:08,634
你在干什么？
What are you doing?

1264
01:25:08,682 --> 01:25:11,915
他根本就没有能力照顾好你，就像对我一样
He wasn't any more capable of caring for you than he was for me.

1265
01:25:11,940 --> 01:25:16,940
这不是真正的你，你的思想已经被粒子影响了
This is not who you are. It's the particles altering your brain chemistry.

1266
01:25:24,850 --> 01:25:27,250
等下，等下，等一下
Wait, wait wait wait wait wait wait.

1267
01:25:28,020 --> 01:25:29,020
你说的太对了
You're right.

1268
01:25:29,538 --> 01:25:31,538
这才是我应该做的
I have to be the one to do it.

1269
01:25:33,540 --> 01:25:34,540
来吧咱们
Here we go.

1270
01:25:36,235 --> 01:25:39,135
把，枪，放，下
Drop. Your. Gun.

1271
01:25:42,310 --> 01:25:45,509
你知道么，那天晚上我本来是要去他家杀他的
You know I came to the house the other night to kill him

1272
01:25:45,545 --> 01:25:46,212
但不巧的是你也在
but you were there.

1273
01:25:46,223 --> 01:25:49,823
你病了，我可以帮助你，先把枪放下
You're sick and I can help you just put the gun down.

1274
01:25:49,910 --> 01:25:52,044
我那时候并没做好杀你的准备
I wasn't ready to kill you then.

1275
01:25:52,712 --> 01:25:54,112
但是现在我做好了
But I think I am now.

1276
01:25:54,141 --> 01:25:56,141
马上把枪放下！
Drop your gun now!

1277
01:25:56,614 --> 01:25:58,747
你站错队伍了，霍普
You picked the wrong side, Hope.

1278
01:26:12,615 --> 01:26:13,615
爸爸！
Dad!

1279
01:26:22,650 --> 01:26:24,750
汉克，哦，不，汉克
Hank. No, no. Hank.

1280
01:26:26,397 --> 01:26:28,430
汉克，听我说，你会没事的
Hank. Listen, you're gonna be okay.

1281
01:26:28,514 --> 01:26:30,081
好吗？你一定会没事的
All right, you're gonna be just fine.

1282
01:26:30,738 --> 01:26:35,005
把制服脱下来，不然我就先爆了你的头然后再扒它下来
Take the suit off or I'll blow your brains out and peel it off.

1283
01:27:00,173 --> 01:27:03,773
皮娒科技有情况，呼号10-33，请求支援
We got a 10-33 at Pym Tech, request immediate backup.

1284
01:27:03,879 --> 01:27:04,879
快走！快走！
Go, go, go.

1285
01:27:17,698 --> 01:27:20,097
送我到屋顶，准备好通讯
Get me to the roof and radio ahead.

1286
01:27:21,375 --> 01:27:24,208
我要直升机马上就能起飞
I want to make sure the helicopter's ready to take off.

1287
01:27:24,239 --> 01:27:27,772
你们俩，只要是从那里面出来的全部给我干掉
You two, kill anything that comes out of that vault.

1288
01:27:28,512 --> 01:27:29,512
爸爸
Dad,

1289
01:27:29,920 --> 01:27:30,920
你能动吗？
can you move?

1290
01:27:33,507 --> 01:27:35,574
我们得带他离开
We need to get him out of here.

1291
01:27:36,201 --> 01:27:39,168
去，拿，那件装甲
Go. Get. That suit.

1292
01:28:21,411 --> 01:28:22,411
嘿，斯科特
Hey Scotty.

1293
01:28:23,442 --> 01:28:25,108
我救了你没有啊？
Hey did I save your life?

1294
01:28:25,968 --> 01:28:26,968
斯科特？
Scotty?

1295
01:28:27,698 --> 01:28:28,698
斯科特？
Scotty?

1296
01:28:30,963 --> 01:28:31,963
谢啦阿毛
Thank you Luis.

1297
01:28:32,590 --> 01:28:34,257
我们现在是好人啦？
Hey are we the good guys?

1298
01:28:34,280 --> 01:28:35,347
- 是啊 - 我们真的当好人啦？
- Yeah. - We're the good guys right?

1299
01:28:35,421 --> 01:28:37,154
是的，我们是好人
Yeah, we're the good guys.

1300
01:28:37,219 --> 01:28:39,019
怎么，怎么感觉，感觉有点怪怪的
Feels kinda, kinda weird, y'know.

1301
01:28:39,036 --> 01:28:40,969
是么，可是还没完事儿呢
Yeah. But we're not done yet.

1302
01:28:41,347 --> 01:28:44,014
赶紧在这里爆炸之前逃出去
Get outta here before this place blows.

1303
01:28:49,785 --> 01:28:50,785
我了个去！
Oh, dammit!

1304
01:28:51,467 --> 01:28:52,467
那个人
That guy.

1305
01:28:54,313 --> 01:28:56,380
嘿！我们得出去啦
Hey! We're getting out of here.

1306
01:29:01,042 --> 01:29:04,375
炸弹已经激活了，我们得赶紧想办法逃出去
The charges are set. We've got to find a way out of here and fast.

1307
01:29:04,568 --> 01:29:05,568
别担心
Don't worry.

1308
01:29:06,184 --> 01:29:08,070
我还死不了
I'm not going to die.

1309
01:29:08,957 --> 01:29:11,090
你也不会
And neither are you.

1310
01:29:11,733 --> 01:29:13,283
这可不只是个钥匙链
It's not a keychain.

1311
01:29:17,152 --> 01:29:18,566
现场一片混乱
It's total chaos in here.

1312
01:29:18,574 --> 01:29:20,724
有很多处交火
Multiple shots fired.

1313
01:29:30,219 --> 01:29:32,186
还有一辆坦克…
And there's a tank.

1314
01:29:41,871 --> 01:29:42,871
帮我下
A little help.

1315
01:29:45,094 --> 01:29:46,094
我来吧
I got him.

1316
01:29:46,739 --> 01:29:47,873
我们需要医生
We need a doctor.

1317
01:29:56,169 --> 01:29:57,169
我们快走吧！

你这是侮辱我，斯科特

你存在的本身就是在侮辱我
Your very existence is insulting to me.

1382

如果你敢变大点，我一定会狠狠的揍死你
Y'know it would be much easier to hit you if you were bigger.

亚原子态…

哦不
Oh no.

1408
01:40:22,927 --> 01:40:27,360
你会不断的缩小…你会进入一个现实中的时间与空间概念
You would enter a reality where all concepts of time and space (echos)

1409
01:40:32,607 --> 01:40:34,840

与你永远…
And as you shrink...

无关的世界…
for all eternity...

1412

你所知道的一切…
everything that you know...

1413
01:40:58,941 --> 01:41:00,341
所爱的一切…
and love...

1423
01:42:28,109 --> 01:42:29,109
真的
So much.

1424
01:42:30,049 --> 01:42:31,049
嗯…
Ahem.

1425
01:42:34,029 --> 01:42:36,096
屋顶被开了个大洞
There's a big hole in the roof.

1426
01:42:38,848 --> 01:42:39,848
抱歉
Sorry.

1427
01:42:42,930 --> 01:42:43,963
她没事吧？
Is she all right?

1428
01:42:44,020 --> 01:42:45,020
她没事
She's fine.

1429
01:42:46,782 --> 01:42:47,782
妈咪
Mommy.

1430
01:42:50,795 --> 01:42:52,328
她很好，她很好
She's fine, she's fine.

1431
01:43:01,506 --> 01:43:03,106
斯科特，说真的
Scott, please.

1432
01:43:03,446 --> 01:43:05,312
你什么都不记得了吗
You don't remember anything?

1433
01:43:05,610 --> 01:43:07,110
汉克，我真的…不记得了
Hank, I, I don't.

1434
01:43:07,514 --> 01:43:09,448
一定是有什么原因的
There must be something else.

1435
01:43:11,523 --> 01:43:17,523
但我猜大概凭人类是无法理解的吧，不过
Well I suppose the human mind just can't comprehend the experience, but

1436
01:43:19,110 --> 01:43:20,110
你做到了
you made it.

1437

你去了那里
You went in

真是太神奇了
It's amazing.

1440
01:43:29,978 --> 01:43:30,978

01:43:31,819 --> 01:43:33,019
我陪你出去
I'll walk you out.

1442
01:43:38,239 --> 01:43:39,239
好好休息
Get some rest.

1443
01:43:47,646 --> 01:43:49,846
真的能做到吗？
Is it possible?

1444
01:44:07,930 --> 01:44:09,230
这又是怎么回事
When did this happen?

1445
01:44:09,256 --> 01:44:10,323
真的没事儿
Nothing's happening.

等等，明明是有点事儿
Well hold on. Something's kind of happening.

如果是这么回事儿的话，还是再给我一枪吧
Well if that's the case, uh, shoot me again.

1448
01:44:16,832 --> 01:44:19,265
嘿，你干嘛突然抓住我就开始亲啊
Yeah, I don't know what you're doing grabbing me and kissing me like that.

1449
01:44:19,340 --> 01:44:22,307
我都被吓蒙了，我还是先赶紧走吧
I was a little surprised myself. I have to get somewhere.

1450
01:44:22,395 --> 01:44:24,995
回头见汉克，你瞧瞧你，霍普
I'll see you later Hank. Really, Hope.

1451
01:44:25,948 --> 01:44:27,081
- 斯科特 - 嗯

- You're full of shit. - Oh yeah.

1453
01:44:31,426 --> 01:44:33,126
斯科特，我今天遇到我的队长了
Well Scott I met with my Captain today.

1454
01:44:33,205 --> 01:44:36,538
他要我给他个报告解释你是怎么出来的
He wanted a report of the night you got out of jail.

1455
01:44:36,623 --> 01:44:38,690
因为监控都出了点儿问题
Something happened with the cameras, and

1456
01:44:38,745 --> 01:44:40,478
电路也都故障了
circuits got fried, and...

1457
01:44:42,012 --> 01:44:44,512
但是我跟他说你是走正常程序出来的
But I told him you were processed correctly.

1458
01:44:44,574 --> 01:44:45,574
真的吗
Really?

1459
01:44:46,063 --> 01:44:47,063
是这样
Well yeah.

1460
01:44:48,090 --> 01:44:51,957
既然已经是技术故障了，我怎么还能把凯茜的爸爸抓起来呢？
Can't be sending Cassie's dad back to jail on a technical glitch, right?

1461
01:44:52,031 --> 01:44:53,164
谢谢你，帕克斯顿
Thank you Paxton.

1462
01:44:53,778 --> 01:44:54,778
我真是没想到
I'm blown away.

1463
01:44:56,327 --> 01:44:57,993
我也得谢谢你为了凯茜做的一切
Thank you for everything you do for Cassie.

1464
01:44:58,048 --> 01:44:59,915
哦，那是我应该做的
Oh well, that's my pleasure.

1465
01:45:01,126 --> 01:45:03,926
但不是因为这个，我是真心的想帮你的
But no, no this one, I, I did it for you.

1466
01:45:06,348 --> 01:45:07,515
呵呵，有点尴尬了
This is awkward.

1467
01:45:07,531 --> 01:45:08,597
- 是啊 - 是啊
- Yeah. - Yeah.

1468
01:45:09,189 --> 01:45:11,422
那我们是不是该聊点别的啥呢？
I mean what do we even talk about after all that?

1469
01:45:11,475 --> 01:45:12,175
- 哦我知道了 - 是什么呢？
- Oh I know. - What?

1470
01:45:12,198 --> 01:45:15,278
- 今天我头一次做了个侧手翻 - 不是吧！
- I did my first cartwheel today. - What?

1471
01:45:15,287 --> 01:45:19,844
是真的，她这礼拜一直在练习呢，今天终于成功了
Yeah. She has been practicing all week, but today was the magic day.

1472
01:45:19,969 --> 01:45:22,035
我用手机录下来了，看
I recorded it on my phone here.

1473
01:45:22,305 --> 01:45:24,872
不是吧，这不可能是凯茜呀，真是你吗？
No, that can't be Cassie. That's not you.

1474
01:45:24,990 --> 01:45:26,257
- 是真的 - 是真的
- Yeah it is. - Yeah it is.

1475
01:45:26,291 --> 01:45:28,324
这简直就是专业体操运动员呀，真的是你吗凯茜
This is a professional gymnast, there's no way that's her.

1476
01:45:28,340 --> 01:45:29,473
是她做的
Yeah, that's her.

1477
01:45:30,663 --> 01:45:31,963
好孩子
Good boy.

1478
01:45:34,220 --> 01:45:36,753
宝贝儿你真的了不起，真棒
Sweetie that's pretty amazing, Peanut.

1479
01:45:39,475 --> 01:45:40,475
抱歉
Sorry.

1480
01:45:42,015 --> 01:45:43,015
是工作的事儿
It's work.

1481
01:45:44,202 --> 01:45:45,202
什么？
Yeah?

1482
01:45:47,736 --> 01:45:48,736
好的
All right.

1483
01:45:48,796 --> 01:45:50,629
先说好了，直接告诉我是个什么事
Here's the deal. Just give me the facts.

1484
01:45:50,687 --> 01:45:52,354
就说事情本身，不要扯别的
Just the facts, only the facts.

1485
01:45:52,504 --> 01:45:53,504
吸气，集中
Breathe. Focus.

1486
01:45:54,847 --> 01:45:55,647
说重点
Keep it simple.

1487
01:45:55,697 --> 01:45:56,997
是是，当然了当然了
No no no, no doubt, no doubt.

1488
01:45:57,004 --> 01:46:00,304
就是那天吧，我跟我表弟伊格纳西奥去了艺术博物馆
Okay, so I'm at this art museum with my cousin Ignacio, right?

1489
01:46:00,340 --> 01:46:03,373
然后呢，那天博物馆里展览的主题应该是，叫什么抽象表现主义，你也知道我对吧
And there was this, like, abstract expressionism exhibit, and you know me, I'm more like

1490
01:46:03,407 --> 01:46:04,940
我比较喜欢的是新立体主义那种的
a Neo-cubist kind of guy, right?

1491
01:46:04,992 --> 01:46:07,159
可是那天展览的有罗斯科的作品，那个简直是太赞了，我的天哪…
（Marcus Rothkowitz，俄裔美国艺术家）
But there was this one Rothko that was sublime, bro, oh my God-

1492
01:46:07,306 --> 01:46:08,306
阿毛
Luis.

1493
01:46:08,916 --> 01:46:11,849
哦哦抱歉抱歉，我又跑…我一想到那个就特别兴奋
Okay sorry sorry I'm j- y'know uh, I just get excited and stuff.

1494
01:46:11,937 --> 01:46:12,937
总之，总之
But anyway, anyway.

1495
01:46:13,056 --> 01:46:13,989
伊格纳西奥跟我说：
Ignacio tells me:

1496
01:46:14,084 --> 01:46:16,484
哟，我昨天晚上遇到了个是记者的小妞，可棒了
Yo, I met this crazy fine writer chick at the spot last night, like,

1497
01:46:17,273 --> 01:46:18,873
简直了，特别，特别的正点
fine, fine, crazy stupid fine.

1498
01:46:18,882 --> 01:46:20,215
然后他去找了酒保聊了聊说
And he goes up to the bartender and goes:

1499
01:46:20,241 --> 01:46:21,474
看我带来的这姑娘，怎么样
Look at the girl I'm with? Y'know I' sayin'

1500
01:46:21,572 --> 01:46:22,872
超级正点的是不是
She's crazy stupid fine right?

1501
01:46:22,957 --> 01:46:23,990
然后酒保就说
And the bartender's all like:

1502
01:46:24,015 --> 01:46:25,615
嗯，的确正点
Yeah, crazy stupid fine.

1503
01:46:26,183 --> 01:46:29,483
然后那个记者小妞跟伊格纳西奥说：嘿你知道么
So this writer chick tells Ignacio: Yo, I'm like a boss in the world of

1504
01:46:29,549 --> 01:46:33,516
我也算八卦狗仔界里的一个人物，我可知道不少小道消息呢
guerrilla journalism, and I got mad connects with the peeps behind the curtains, y'know I' sayin?

1505
01:46:33,587 --> 01:46:35,054
伊格纳西奥就说：真的吗？
Ignacio's like: For real?

1506
01:46:35,135 --> 01:46:38,435
然后她说：那可不是么，我跟你说的这个事就是，但我不能告诉你线人是谁
And she's like: Yeah. You know what, I can't tell you who my contact is, because

1507
01:46:38,443 --> 01:46:39,876
因为他是跟复仇者一起的
he works with the Avengers.

1508
01:46:39,899 --> 01:46:40,899
哦不是吧！
Oh no.

1509
01:46:41,022 --> 01:46:43,589
是啊，他看起来可是个狠角色
Yeah, this dude sounds like a bad-ass, man.

1510
01:46:43,672 --> 01:46:45,005
他上来就这么问我
Like he comes up to him and he says, y'know:

1511
01:46:45,037 --> 01:46:48,504
我在找一个最近才出现的家伙，有某种特殊新技术
I'm looking for this dude who's new on the scene who's, like, flashing this fresh tack, who's got, like,

1512
01:46:48,509 --> 01:46:50,576
移动迅速，你有什么情报么？
bomb moves, right? Who you got?

1513
01:46:50,602 --> 01:46:53,735
然后她就说：那现在外面各种奇怪的人都有啊，会蹦高的
And she's like: Well, we got everything nowadays, we got a guy who jumps,

1514
01:46:53,774 --> 01:46:56,407
会甩丝荡秋千的，还有个能爬墙的
we got a guy who swings, we got a guy who crawls up the walls,

1515
01:46:56,449 --> 01:46:57,549
你得说的具体一点
you gotta be more specific.

1516
01:46:57,603 --> 01:46:59,770
然后他说，我在找一个能缩小的
And he's like: I'm looking for a guy that shrinks.

1517
01:46:59,774 --> 01:47:01,807
然后我听到这里差点吓尿了，我靠
And I'm like: Daaamn! I got all nervous 'cause

1518
01:47:01,906 --> 01:47:03,306
因为我从来没说过你的事儿哥们
I keep mad secrets for you, bro.

1519
01:47:03,331 --> 01:47:04,198
所以我就问伊格纳西奥
So I asked Ignacio:

1520
01:47:04,295 --> 01:47:05,095
那内个狠角色
Did bad-ass

1521
01:47:05,125 --> 01:47:06,325
有没有告诉超正记者妞来
tell the stupid fine writer chick

1522
01:47:06,341 --> 01:47:07,341
告诉你再告诉我
to tell you to tell me

1523
01:47:07,765 --> 01:47:10,698
就因为我跟他找的那个人有关系？
because I'm tight with that man that he's looking for him?

1524
01:47:10,764 --> 01:47:11,764
然后？
And?

1525
01:47:11,874 --> 01:47:12,874
他说什么？
What'd he say?

1526
01:47:16,256 --> 01:47:17,756
他说就是这么回事
He said yes.

1527
01:47:25,971 --> 01:47:28,438
我想给你看一样东西
There's something I want to show you.

1528
01:47:29,892 --> 01:47:32,892
我意识到力量是不能被摧毁的
I realized you can't destroy power.

1529
01:47:34,756 --> 01:47:38,622
我能做到的就是让它不落到坏人的手里
All you can do is make sure that it's in the right hands.

1530
01:47:45,211 --> 01:47:50,078
这是我和你妈妈研发的改进版原型装甲
This is an advanced prototype that your mother and I worked on together.

1531
01:47:51,125 --> 01:47:52,725
她一直没机会试过
She never got to use it.

1532
01:47:54,286 --> 01:47:58,486
直到现在我才意识到，我们其实是为你做的
But now I realize that we were, we were working on it for you.

1533
01:48:05,454 --> 01:48:07,521
也许是时候完成这件装甲了
Maybe it's time we finished it.

1534
01:48:14,260 --> 01:48:16,360
是时候了
It's about damn time.

1535
01:48:23,629 --> 01:48:24,629
嘿 队长！
Hey Cap!

1536
01:48:36,836 --> 01:48:37,911
帮帮我
Help...

1537
01:48:38,980 --> 01:48:41,846
要是早一个礼拜就好办多了
This would've been a lot easier a week ago.

1538
01:48:41,874 --> 01:48:44,974
- 如果我们找托尼… - 不要，他肯定不会信的 - 就算是他信了…
- If we call Tony... - No, he won't believe us. - Even if he did...

1539
01:48:44,975 --> 01:48:48,342
根据“协定”他也不一定能帮忙
Who knows if The Accords would let him help.

1540
01:48:48,371 --> 01:48:49,504
我们只能靠自己了
We're on our own.

1541
01:48:51,009 --> 01:48:52,109
也未必
Maybe not.

1542
01:48:54,699 --> 01:48:55,999
我知道个人
I know a guy.
