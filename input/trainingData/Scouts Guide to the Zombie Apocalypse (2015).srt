我們得不斷嘗試

58
00:08:00,095 --> 00:08:03,001
卡特 注意言辭

00:08:03,001 --> 00:08:04,018
他說的沒錯 沒人會報名

60
00:08:04,018 --> 00:08:05,078
只是在浪費時間
It's just a waste of time.

61
00:08:05,078 --> 00:08:08,082
你們缺乏信念 童子軍精神哪去了
Ye of little faith. Where's that scout spirit?

62
00:08:08,082 --> 00:08:10,095

Look, guys, we're not gonna quit trying just because

毫無進展地失去了幾小時
we lost a couple hours sitting around on our butts

64
00:08:13,013 --> 00:08:14,096
而放棄嘗試
with nothing to show for it.

65
00:08:14,096 --> 00:08:16,099
我意思是 有些人用了一生的時間
I mean, some people spend their entire lives

66
00:08:16,099 --> 00:08:18,073
都毫無進展
and have nothing to show for it.

兩年了 本
It's been two years, Ben.

102
00:09:47,058 --> 00:09:50,095
我們不能只是因爲覺得對不起他而留在童子軍
We can't just stay in scouts because we feel sorry for him.

103
00:09:50,095 --> 00:09:52,069

Come on. Junior year is when all the girls become sluts.

112
00:10:10,096 --> 00:10:12,001
- 真的? - 沒錯
- Oh, really? -  Yes.

113
00:10:12,001 --> 00:10:15,008
童子軍制服要是還被我們穿著
And if we're sitting here in these scout uniforms,

I didn't mean to! It wasn't my fault, Carter!

125

I think it's just a big joke at this point.

175
00:13:17,006 --> 00:13:18,036
並不是笑話

335
00:21:36,086 --> 00:21:38,099
一會兒又像是分手了

所以他是個混蛋

奇怪 他從不遲到
That's weird. He's never late.

349
00:22:05,085 --> 00:22:08,042
沒錯 或許他退出童子軍了
Yeah. Maybe he quit scouts.

350
00:22:09,022 --> 00:22:11,049
退出童子軍?是啊 沒錯

00:25:31,084 --> 00:25:32,086
- 真的? - 沒錯
- Really? - Yeah.

409
00:25:32,086 --> 00:25:34,059
哇哦 那好像是七年前的事了
Wow. That was like seven years ago.

410
00:25:34,060 --> 00:25:37,016
我知道 不可思議吧
I know. Crazy, right?

411
00:25:37,016 --> 00:25:38,093
那天和卡特在拉屎時
Oh. That was the same day Carter sat on the cactus

412
00:25:38,093 --> 00:25:40,081
坐到仙人掌上是同一天 對嗎
when he was taking a shit, right?

413
00:25:42,064 --> 00:25:44,035
然後你爸不得不挑掉那些刺
And your dad had to pick out the needles.

414
00:25:45,061 --> 00:25:46,064
是啊
Yeah.

415
00:25:55,092 --> 00:25:58,036
奧基 我知道我們不怎麽聊你爸
Augie, I know we don't talk about your dad much,

416
00:25:59,079 --> 00:26:01,032
但你想的話也沒關係
but it's okay if you want to.

417
00:26:03,093 --> 00:26:06,009
要知道 我只是不想掃興
I just don't want to be a downer, you know.

418
00:26:06,009 --> 00:26:07,056
別這樣 奧基 你不會掃興的
Come on, augie, you're not being a downer.

419
00:26:07,056 --> 00:26:08,054
他是你爸
He was your dad.

420
00:26:09,003 --> 00:26:10,060
你能談談他
You can talk about him.

421
00:26:12,073 --> 00:26:13,060
謝了 本
Thanks, Ben.

422
00:26:14,010 --> 00:26:15,087
沒事 應該的
Yeah. Of course.

423
00:26:21,001 --> 00:26:22,068
童子軍萬歲?
Scouts forever?

424
00:26:23,081 --> 00:26:25,061
當然 童子軍萬歲
Yeah. Scouts forever.

425
00:26:40,066 --> 00:26:42,026
本 嘿
Ben. Hey.

426
00:26:42,026 --> 00:26:43,073
來吧 本 我們走
Come on, Ben. Let's go.

427
00:26:43,073 --> 00:26:45,010
卡特 我覺得這樣不太好
Carter, I don't know about this.

428
00:26:45,010 --> 00:26:46,067
你能別杞人憂天了嗎
Will you stop crying about this?

429
00:26:46,067 --> 00:26:48,054
走吧 快 動起來
Let's go. Come on, we're doing this.

Let's go. Come on.

431
00:26:50,071 --> 00:26:51,067
快
Come on.

432
00:27:40,076 --> 00:27:42,080
我們有打擾到嗎
Are we interrupting?

433
00:27:45,036 --> 00:27:46,066
你們看上去好棒
You look amazing.

434
00:27:46,066 --> 00:27:47,096
謝謝
Thank you.

435
00:27:47,096 --> 00:27:49,019
嘿 你們看到我弟了嗎
Hey, have you guys seen my brother?

436
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:50,085
他本該已經到了
He should have been here by now.

437
00:27:51,030 --> 00:27:54,017
沒看到 哪都沒他影子
No. I haven't seen him anywhere, no.

438
00:27:54,017 --> 00:27:56,027
聽著 我肯定他很快會到這裏 好嗎
But look, I'm sure he'll be here any second. Okay?

439
00:27:59,004 --> 00:28:01,086
老兄 奧基要是醒了而我們不在那怎麽辦
Dude. What if augie wakes up and we're not there?

440
00:28:01,086 --> 00:28:02,088
他不會醒
He's not gonna wake up.

441
00:28:02,088 --> 00:28:05,020
要是我們營地的楚巴卡是個該死的大腳怪
If Chewbacca was fucking bigfoot in our campsite,

442
00:28:05,020 --> 00:28:06,025
他就不會醒
he'd still be asleep.

443
00:28:08,054 --> 00:28:09,058
- 那是什麽 - 什麽
- What is that? - What?

444
00:28:11,072 --> 00:28:13,072
看 看啊 他來過這裏
Look. Look, he was here.

445
00:28:13,072 --> 00:28:16,029
好吧 所以他決定回家了
Okay. So, he decided to go back home.

446
00:28:16,029 --> 00:28:17,002
他改主意了
He changed his mind.

447
00:28:17,002 --> 00:28:18,046
不是 童子軍隊長羅傑斯
No, no, no. Scout leader Rogers

448
00:28:18,046 --> 00:28:19,086
永遠不會離開他的幸運刀
would never leave his lucky knife.

449
00:28:19,086 --> 00:28:21,046
我覺得有些不對勁
I think something's wrong.

450
00:28:21,046 --> 00:28:24,014
老兄 我們有病啊 坐這裏聊這些
Dude, what's wrong is us sitting here talking about this.

451
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,077
老兄 看啊 看他的腳印
Dude, look. Look at his prints.

452
00:28:27,077 --> 00:28:30,010
他拖著腳走路 像是跛了似的
His foot was dragging like he had a limp or something.

453
00:28:30,010 --> 00:28:33,002
好吧 爲你凶殘的追蹤技術喝彩
Okay. Hurray for your mad tracking skills.

454
00:28:33,002 --> 00:28:34,094
我們能...我們能走了嗎 行嗎
Can we just... Can we go? Please?

455
00:28:44,085 --> 00:28:46,049
我就覺得他出了很嚴重的事
I just think something really bad happened to him.

456
00:28:46,049 --> 00:28:48,033
- 又在說羅傑斯嗎 - 是啊
- Are we still talking about Rogers? - Yeah.

457
00:28:48,033 --> 00:28:50,076
老兄 他坐在家裏穿得像多莉•帕頓
Dude, he is sitting at home dressed up like Dolly parton

458
00:28:50,076 --> 00:28:52,091
唱著秀場樂 安心吧
singing show tunes. Relax.

459
00:28:56,073 --> 00:28:58,017
糟糕
Oh, shit.

460
00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:02,017
奧基 等下 奧基
Augie, wait! Augie!

462
00:29:05,044 --> 00:29:06,074
我以爲我們是摯友
I thought we were best friends.

463
00:29:06,074 --> 00:29:07,097
我們是摯友
We are best friends.

464
00:29:07,098 --> 00:29:09,088
- 我們正要回來 - 真的?
- We were coming back. - Really?

465
00:29:09,088 --> 00:29:11,043
在派對之後吧
After your party?

466
00:29:12,045 --> 00:29:14,038
你知道?
You know about that?

467
00:29:14,038 --> 00:29:15,081
所有人都知道高四派對的事 卡特
Everybody knows about the senior party, Carter.

468
00:29:15,081 --> 00:29:16,095
我這種窩囊廢都知道
Even a loser like me.

469
00:29:16,095 --> 00:29:18,018
奧基 別那麽說
Augie, don't say that.

470
00:29:18,019 --> 00:29:19,061
爲什麽 你們是這麽想的啊
Why not? It's what you guys think!

471
00:29:19,061 --> 00:29:21,009
我們沒覺得你是窩囊廢
We don't think you're a loser.

472
00:29:21,009 --> 00:29:22,092

我們要退出童子軍 奧基
We're quitting scouts, augie.

477

Augie, come on!

484
00:29:59,026 --> 00:30:00,094
就讓他去吧 本
Just leave him, Ben.

485
00:30:14,058 --> 00:30:17,018

What the fuck... What's wrong with the radio?

486

童子軍隊長羅傑斯 你在家嗎

547

冷靜?你瘋了嗎 我們差點在裏面被殺
Calm down? Are you crazy? We almost got killed in there!

551
00:37:21,054 --> 00:37:23,026
- 那是你的車嗎 - 能麻煩你告訴我們

No! Not until you tell us what's happening.

555
00:37:27,059 --> 00:37:28,094
誰有濕巾
Anybody got a wet nap?

556
00:37:28,094 --> 00:37:30,022
你他媽認爲是怎麽回事
What the fuck do you think is happening?

557
00:37:30,022 --> 00:37:31,028
大家在人吃人
Everyone's eating each other!

558
00:37:31,028 --> 00:37:32,091
- 等下 像是... - 沒錯

我想是可能的 本
I think it's possible, Ben.

561
00:37:35,045 --> 00:37:37,095
一個死了的脫衣舞女試圖吃我臉
A dead stripper just tried to eat my face!

562
00:37:37,095 --> 00:37:39,019

Oh, fuck. Oh, shit.

564
00:37:41,072 --> 00:37:43,032
朝它開槍 開槍
Just shoot it! Shoot it!

565
00:37:50,090 --> 00:37:52,041
沒錯 是僵屍
Yep. Zombie.

566
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,087
還有問題嗎
Any more questions?

567
00:38:08,052 --> 00:38:10,028

- Come on! - I'm going as fast as I can.

00:39:08,008 --> 00:39:10,024
你媽的一定是在逗我
You got to be fucking kidding me.

583
00:39:16,054 --> 00:39:17,062
開車 開車 
Go! Go! Go!

584
00:40:53,005 --> 00:40:55,008
童子軍隊長羅傑斯 今晚怎麽回事
Scout leader Rogers! What happened tonight?

585
00:40:55,008 --> 00:40:56,048
我們擔心你呢
We were worried about you.

586
00:40:58,059 --> 00:41:02,060
我知道那不禮貌 很抱歉 我不得不用你家厠所
I know. It's bad. I'm so sorry. I had to use your bathroom.

587
00:41:02,060 --> 00:41:03,056
我想是因爲豆子
I think it was the beans.

588
00:41:04,069 --> 00:41:06,059
和棉花糖的緣故
And the marshmallows.

589
00:41:07,096 --> 00:41:11,053
我試了噴霧 就是散不去那味
I tried spraying. It just lingers.

590
00:41:23,098 --> 00:41:26,088
童子軍隊長羅傑斯 拜託 別這樣
Scout leader Rogers! Please!Stop!

591
00:41:30,022 --> 00:41:32,088
我想你對某種東西産生了嚴重過敏
I think you're having a bad allergic reaction to something!

592
00:41:32,088 --> 00:41:34,089
我們得帶你看醫生
We need to get you to a doctor!

593
00:43:11,002 --> 00:43:12,095
所有撤離巴士已經離開
"All evacuation buses have departed.

594
00:43:12,095 --> 00:43:14,069
經由1號國道
"Proceed north on route 1

595
00:43:14,069 --> 00:43:16,089
前往17號英里標記處的安檢站
"to the security checkpoint at mile marker 17."

596
00:43:16,089 --> 00:43:19,012
見鬼 鎮上的人被撤離了
Oh, shit. They evacuated the town.

597
00:43:19,013 --> 00:43:20,033
真是太好了
That's great.

598
00:43:20,033 --> 00:43:22,032
我錯過了派對 也沒見著克洛伊
I missed the party, and I missed Chloe,

599
00:43:22,032 --> 00:43:24,023
- 而我現在要死了 - 夥計們
- and now I'm gonna die. - Guys.

600
00:43:24,023 --> 00:43:25,023
卡特 冷靜 我們得想想
Carter, calm down! We need to figure out

601
00:43:25,023 --> 00:43:26,066
- 怎麽辦 - 夥計們
- what we're gonna do. - Guys!

602
00:43:32,097 --> 00:43:33,097
快走
Come on.

603
00:43:37,021 --> 00:43:39,038
快 快 快走
Go, go, go!

604
00:43:39,038 --> 00:43:41,055
- 卡特 鎖門 - 我他媽是想鎖啊 老兄
- Carter, lock it! - I'm trying to fuckin' lock it, man!

605
00:43:41,055 --> 00:43:42,055
鎖不住啊
It's not working.

606
00:43:44,078 --> 00:43:46,032
- 快啊 - 我在試
- Come on! - I'm trying!

607
00:43:46,081 --> 00:43:47,062
走開
Move!

608
00:43:49,082 --> 00:43:50,072
快走
Come on!

609
00:44:06,074 --> 00:44:08,001
卡特 去拿斧頭
Carter, get the axe!

610
00:44:26,096 --> 00:44:27,093
快走 快走
Go, go, go.

611
00:44:33,006 --> 00:44:34,010
他們來了
They're coming!

612
00:45:06,047 --> 00:45:09,001
真他媽太好了 現在怎麽辦
This is fucking awesome! Now what?

613
00:45:14,027 --> 00:45:17,034
我真抱歉放火燒你 童子軍隊長羅傑斯
I'm really sorry i set you on fire, scout leader Rogers.

614
00:45:17,034 --> 00:45:19,015
但願傷得沒看起來那麽嚴重
But hopefully, it's not as bad as it looks.

615
00:45:22,005 --> 00:45:24,028
我打了雙反手收尾結
I used a double overhand stopper knot.

616
00:45:24,092 --> 00:45:26,038
很難掙脫 對嗎
It's hard to get out of, right?

617
00:45:29,037 --> 00:45:31,024
好的 好吧
Okay. All right.

618
00:45:35,013 --> 00:45:37,086
好了 我馬上回來
Okay, now. I'll be right back.

619
00:45:38,073 --> 00:45:39,096
好好待著
Just stay there.

620
00:46:09,033 --> 00:46:10,091
夥計 搞什麽啊
Dude, what the fuck?

621
00:46:11,053 --> 00:46:13,070
你們沒吃夠嗎 天呐
Haven't you had enough to eat? Jesus.

622
00:46:14,027 --> 00:46:15,090
卡特 別惹怒他們
Carter, stop agitating them.

623
00:46:15,090 --> 00:46:17,033
怎麽了 我要張新的檔案照
What? I need a new profile pic.

624
00:46:21,041 --> 00:46:23,091
那麽 你覺得派對的人都被他們撤離了嗎
So, do you think they evacuated everyone at the party?

625
00:46:23,091 --> 00:46:25,042
當然 他們必須那麽做
Yeah, of course. They had to.

626
00:46:26,051 --> 00:46:28,031
至少我們知道我們父母沒事
At least we know our parents are okay.

627
00:46:28,031 --> 00:46:30,038
- 是啊 - 他們在哪
- Yeah. - Where are they?

628
00:46:30,038 --> 00:46:32,098
他們去了某個蹩腳的心靈瑜伽靜修處
They went to some lame spiritual yoga retreat.

629
00:46:32,099 --> 00:46:35,010
我寧願待在這裏
Ugh. I think I'd rather be in here.

630
00:46:40,046 --> 00:46:42,036
但願奧基沒事
I hope augie's okay.

631
00:46:42,036 --> 00:46:44,046
- 奧基是誰 - 他是我們的摯友
Who's augie? He's our best friend.

632
00:46:44,046 --> 00:46:46,044
現在是前任摯友了
Well, ex-best friend now.

633
00:46:46,044 --> 00:46:47,090
爲什麽是前任
Why ex?

634
00:46:47,090 --> 00:46:49,095
我們因爲派對而甩開了他
Because we ditched him for a party.

635
00:46:49,095 --> 00:46:51,047
本 我們是要回去的
Ben, we were gonna go back.

636
00:46:51,047 --> 00:46:53,034
無所謂了 卡特 我們甩開了他 我們不上路
Whatever, Carter. We ditched him. We're bad friends.

637
00:46:53,034 --> 00:46:55,062
你們爲什麽不帶上他
Why didn't you guys just take him with you?

638
00:46:57,014 --> 00:46:59,011
你不認識奧基
You don't know augie.

639
00:46:59,011 --> 00:47:00,092
- 怎麽 - 他只是與衆不同
- What? - He's just different.

640
00:47:00,096 --> 00:47:02,021
大怪胎?
Big geek?

641
00:47:02,022 --> 00:47:04,012
他收集鹿屎 還編籃子
He collects deer shit and weaves baskets.

642
00:47:04,012 --> 00:47:05,059
知道嗎 你想像下
Okay? You do the math.

643
00:47:06,015 --> 00:47:07,035
好吧
Okay.

644
00:47:07,035 --> 00:47:08,099
給個忠告
Word of advice,

645
00:47:08,099 --> 00:47:10,084
在高中追求派對和流行?
chasing parties and popularity in high school?

646
00:47:10,084 --> 00:47:12,019
完全沒用
It's a total dead end.

647
00:47:12,019 --> 00:47:13,046
對於以後是無關緊要的
None of that shit will matter later.

648
00:47:13,046 --> 00:47:15,068
相信我 我清楚
Trust me. I know.

649
00:47:15,068 --> 00:47:17,068
你說的沒錯 但你不是在高中輟學了嗎
You're right, but didn't you, like, drop out of high school?

650
00:47:17,068 --> 00:47:19,056
- 沒有 我拿到了同等學歷證 - 怎麽會
- No, I got my ged. - Why?

651
00:47:19,057 --> 00:47:21,083
不是所有人都像你不學無術
'Cause not everybody has a Lily-white life like you do.

652
00:47:21,084 --> 00:47:24,007
好吧 天啊 你真不友好
Okay. God, you're so hostile.

653
00:47:24,007 --> 00:47:26,044
三秒後我踹你屁股才叫不友好
No, hostile is three seconds from now when my foot's up your ass.

654
00:47:26,044 --> 00:47:28,007
好啊 放馬過來
Okay, yeah. Try all you want,

655
00:47:28,007 --> 00:47:29,037
但我屁股恰巧很緊
but I happen to have a very tight asshole.

656
00:47:29,038 --> 00:47:30,091
我想我能幫你撐開
I think I could stretch it out for you.

657
00:47:30,091 --> 00:47:32,048
那幫我潤滑潤滑 寶貝
Oh, well, then lube me up, baby.

658
00:47:32,048 --> 00:47:34,087
卡特 我們現在玩個安靜遊戲 好嗎
Carter! We're gonna play the quiet game now, okay?

659
00:47:36,025 --> 00:47:37,092
好吧 你們可以的 
All right, you know what? Fine.

660
00:47:38,085 --> 00:47:40,018
我受夠你們兩個了
I'm over both of you.

661
00:47:49,063 --> 00:47:52,016
你很拿手啊
You're pretty good at that.

662
00:47:52,017 --> 00:47:54,060
是啊 我想切削獎章總算派上用場了
Yeah, I guess that whittling badge finally paid off.

663
00:47:58,020 --> 00:47:59,044
你呢
What about you?

664
00:47:59,044 --> 00:48:01,024
我?
What about me?

665
00:48:01,024 --> 00:48:03,001
你怎麽學會用那種霰彈槍的
How'd you learn to use a shotgun like that?

666
00:48:04,051 --> 00:48:07,095
我前男友對槍很感興趣
My ex-boyfriend was really into guns.

667
00:48:07,095 --> 00:48:10,031
他每週都要拉我去次靶場
He used to drag me to the firing range once a week.

668
00:48:11,095 --> 00:48:14,055
那現在沒男友?
So, no boyfriend now?

669
00:48:14,055 --> 00:48:16,028
我會儘量避免有
Not if I can help it.

670
00:48:17,002 --> 00:48:18,042
爲什麽這麽說
Well, why do you say that?

671
00:48:18,042 --> 00:48:20,093
怎麽說呢
I don't know.

672
00:48:20,093 --> 00:48:23,006
這麽說吧 我對男人的品位很差
Let's just say, i have really shitty taste in guys.

673
00:48:23,006 --> 00:48:25,026
我一個人最好不過了
I'm better off alone.

674
00:48:25,027 --> 00:48:27,016
沒人如此
Nobody's better off alone.

675
00:48:27,017 --> 00:48:28,067
好吧 我就是
Yeah, well, I am.

676
00:48:30,050 --> 00:48:32,038
多麽美好的一刻
Aww, what a beautiful moment.

677
00:48:32,097 --> 00:48:35,004
混蛋 好痛
Ow! Asshole, that hurt!

678
00:48:35,004 --> 00:48:36,064
- 當然 就是要這效果 - 就是要這效果?

我只是覺得有點小諷刺
Well, I just think it's a little ironic

797
00:55:17,004 --> 00:55:18,064
要知道 現在你們都很生氣
that, you know, you're all upset now

798
00:55:18,064 --> 00:55:20,031
因爲你們被甩開了

三年來我們一直在騙你

805

穿著這些愚蠢的衣服

806
00:55:32,046 --> 00:55:33,064
所以大家都能取笑我們

807
00:55:33,064 --> 00:55:34,069
卡特 夠了

你的地板在咯吱咯吱
You have squeaky floors.

874
00:59:42,074 --> 00:59:44,051
這是卡特姐姐？

是啊 肯達爾

她顯然遺傳了良好基因

So, how come you haven't told her you like her?

883
01:00:07,003 --> 01:00:08,083
有什麽用
What's the point?

884
01:00:08,083 --> 01:00:10,070
她絕不會喜歡我這樣的人
She's never gonna go for a guy like me.

885
01:00:10,070 --> 01:00:12,074
她有男朋友
And she's got a boyfriend.

那不是個好主意
It was a bad idea.

906
01:00:50,045 --> 01:00:51,091
沒事 再試一次
No, no, no. Let's just try it again.
