床伴逐个数/先生你哪位？(台译)/翻兜有情郎(港译)
WHAT'S YOUR NUMBER?

14
00:02:30,083 --> 00:02:33,610
为什么你每天早上都那么棒啊？

15
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:36,314
是吗？额……

16
00:02:44,063 --> 00:02:45,052
亲爱的，我走了

17
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:47,099
哦！我做了天培香肠呢！

18
00:02:57,310 --> 00:03:02,539
我在想，你愿不愿意当我的男伴去出席我妹妹的婚礼？

20
00:03:02,649 --> 00:03:04,583
可以选择素食，我查过了

21
00:03:06,419 --> 00:03:08,148
你爸妈会去吗？

22
00:03:09,222 --> 00:03:12,385
去我妹妹的婚礼？我想会吧

23
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:15,050
只是感觉严肃了点

24
00:03:16,496 --> 00:03:17,622
哦

25
00:03:18,264 --> 00:03:20,596
抱歉，只是……

26
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:23,692
你昨晚是从我后面X的，感觉有点严重……

27
00:03:23,803 --> 00:03:25,395
还看不见你的脸，所以……

28
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:36,414
如果你想上床，可以call我

29
00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:40,849
谢了Rick，你真大方！

30
00:03:41,988 --> 00:03:44,047
耶~

31
00:03:44,157 --> 00:03:47,320
- 再见！ - 记得要穿绿色的哦！

34
00:03:56,035 --> 00:03:57,434
Colin，快点！

37
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:06,307
Ally，我两个月前就打算告诉你

38
00:04:06,412 --> 00:04:08,778
不要和Rick谈下去了

39
00:04:08,881 --> 00:04:10,109
为啥呢？

40
00:04:10,216 --> 00:04:12,377
你爱吃肉，你恨骑自行车的！

41
00:04:12,485 --> 00:04:14,715
- 我真的爱吃肉！ - 说真的

42
00:04:14,821 --> 00:04:18,154
我总是会担心他用的那招“老汉推车(doggy-style)”

43
00:04:18,524 --> 00:04:20,583
有些人喜欢，你懂的

44
00:04:21,194 --> 00:04:22,161
不可能，没人喜欢

45
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:24,253
甚至是狗也只会想着快点结束

46
00:04:24,364 --> 00:04:27,891
在我遇到真命天子之前我得经历多少段感情啊？

47
00:04:28,001 --> 00:04:29,332
很明显，一大堆

48
00:04:29,435 --> 00:04:32,427
嗨~ 我就是新娘，我叫Daisy……

59
00:05:02,535 --> 00:05:05,095
- 同志们好！ - 好！

60
00:05:06,472 --> 00:05:08,872
就现在。在想还是在闻？

61
00:05:09,475 --> 00:05:11,670
毫无疑问，在闻！

62
00:05:11,778 --> 00:05:13,439
很明显，他在想嘛！

63
00:05:14,247 --> 00:05:15,874
无论她说什么都会发人深思

64
00:05:15,982 --> 00:05:18,974
如果她在谈论他手指头的味道的话，就像真的了

65
00:05:25,625 --> 00:05:28,025
- Ally - 嗨

66
00:05:31,631 --> 00:05:34,259
李连杰和李小龙没关系

67
00:05:34,967 --> 00:05:37,231
“李”是中国非常普通的姓氏

68
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:39,498
他们都会武功，但是……

69
00:05:40,873 --> 00:05:42,500
别脱，穿着

70
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:45,538
Ok，我待会儿再打给你

71
00:05:49,982 --> 00:05:53,349
亲爱的，你被FIRE了

72
00:05:53,453 --> 00:05:57,014
对不起，因为我们不得不忍痛割爱……

73
00:06:01,627 --> 00:06:03,424
还有谁被炒了？

74
00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:05,087
额……目前

75
00:06:06,566 --> 00:06:07,590
就你一个

77
00:06:32,458 --> 00:06:36,326
妈，我待会儿再打给你，我在开会，好吗？

78
00:06:44,504 --> 00:06:45,528
（妖艳女装应对办公到天黑）

79
00:06:46,939 --> 00:06:48,167
姐不需要

79
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,500
（食物秤，你的新朋友？）

80
00:06:51,144 --> 00:06:52,236
不！

81
00:06:57,181 --> 00:06:59,273
你睡过几个？（你和几个男人睡过？太多？
太少？睡过几个说明你什么？）

82
00:07:02,088 --> 00:07:04,420
（女人一生中的情人平均数为10.5个）
10.5？哦，放屁！

83
00:07:06,926 --> 00:07:08,257
抱歉！

84
00:07:08,361 --> 00:07:10,727
书上说女人一生中的情人

85
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:13,697
平均数为10.5个

86
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,631
是啊，怎么那么多啊？

87
00:07:16,068 --> 00:07:18,593
多？那太少了！

88
00:07:18,871 --> 00:07:21,931
- 10.5太少了！- 随你怎么说

88
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:52,100
（和我睡过的人列表）

89
00:08:13,125 --> 00:08:14,592
还有Valerio!

90
00:08:37,383 --> 00:08:38,816
哦，你终于来了！

91
00:08:38,918 --> 00:08:40,681
嗨，妈

93
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:43,648
哦，抱歉

94
00:08:43,756 --> 00:08:45,519
真不好意思，火车误点了，你看起来不错！

95
00:08:48,327 --> 00:08:49,624
我留长了留海

97
00:08:51,163 --> 00:08:53,222
哦，Rick呢？

98
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:55,732
Rick因公事出差了

99
00:08:56,102 --> 00:08:58,468
哦，干你妹，我还说终于可以见到他了呢！

100
00:08:58,571 --> 00:09:00,801
至少这一位不会做动物状的气球！

101
00:09:00,907 --> 00:09:03,341
你为什么不穿我买给你的那件？

102
00:09:04,277 --> 00:09:06,142
这就是啊！

103
00:09:06,245 --> 00:09:08,839
什么？怎么和穿这衣服的模特那么不一样啊！

104
00:09:09,949 --> 00:09:12,679
- Daisy在楼上吗？ - 她在，她搜桑了~

105
00:09:12,785 --> 00:09:14,275
我上去看看她

106
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:15,979
去吧

107
00:09:17,089 --> 00:09:20,320
- 你堂弟Beau来了！ - 不是亲的！

108
00:09:20,426 --> 00:09:23,589
他不是我亲堂弟，我们没血缘关系！

109
00:09:25,998 --> 00:09:27,363
还有Beau……

110
00:09:29,135 --> 00:09:30,159
嗨

111
00:09:30,269 --> 00:09:31,793
感谢上帝你来了

112
00:09:31,904 --> 00:09:34,737
自从Eddie的爸妈来了以后，妈就像只母狗一样

113
00:09:34,974 --> 00:09:38,410
她就是无法相信她的婚姻结束在他们之前

114
00:09:38,511 --> 00:09:39,910
哦，爸也快来了

115
00:09:40,012 --> 00:09:41,536
她又有一个人来给她发泄仇恨了

116
00:09:41,948 --> 00:09:45,384
恩，爸没来，她没叫我请他来

117
00:09:45,484 --> 00:09:47,008
你请他来你的婚礼吗？

118
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:48,787
不知道

120
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:56,887
令人讨厌的木偶人的真名叫什么？

121
00:09:56,996 --> 00:10:00,088
你指那个住隔壁让我迷恋的家伙？Gerry Perry。

122
00:10:00,199 --> 00:10:02,064
Gerry Perry！谢谢……

123
00:10:05,871 --> 00:10:06,895
你在写神马？

124
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:10,065
没什么，就写一些祝酒词的提示

125
00:10:10,176 --> 00:10:11,404
要押韵吗？

126
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:13,740
看情况。什么跟“orgy”押韵啊？

127
00:10:14,046 --> 00:10:16,173
三分钟内就行。Ready？

128
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:18,375
- 你看起来不错嘛 - 谢啦

129
00:10:18,484 --> 00:10:20,509
你先去吧，我待会儿下来

130
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:21,678
Ok

131
00:10:24,123 --> 00:10:25,886
8，9，10，11

132
00:10:25,992 --> 00:10:28,051
12，13，14，15

133
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:32,324
16，17，18，19

134
00:10:34,533 --> 00:10:36,524
他妈的，有19个！

135
00:10:46,545 --> 00:10:48,740
请大家注意

137
00:10:52,151 --> 00:10:55,848
请大家注意一下，我想谢谢到场的每一个人

138
00:10:55,955 --> 00:10:57,855
- 每个人…… - 哼

139
00:10:57,957 --> 00:10:58,946
真可爱

140
00:11:03,462 --> 00:11:04,793
Beau！

141
00:11:07,233 --> 00:11:10,225
他在咪咪上会有点粗糙

142
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:15,103
……来庆祝我的梦想成真，Daisy和Eddie的订婚

144
00:11:16,442 --> 00:11:20,378
大家都知道，我们家喜欢为别人祝酒

145
00:11:20,479 --> 00:11:25,143
那么，来滚球球，Daisy的姐姐Ally？

146
00:11:25,918 --> 00:11:27,249
Ally

147
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:32,688
Hello

148
00:11:33,292 --> 00:11:34,418
Hello

149
00:11:44,737 --> 00:11:48,400
当Daisy告诉我，她和Eddie在约会

150
00:11:48,507 --> 00:11:49,531
我不敢相信

151
00:11:49,675 --> 00:11:50,972
噢~

152
00:11:51,177 --> 00:11:54,772
我问，“是Eddie Vogel吗？”

153
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:57,178
“在高中和你出去玩的那个猪？”

154
00:11:57,283 --> 00:11:59,478
“他是他们里面最二的一个二逼”

155
00:12:00,953 --> 00:12:03,581
比Baby Hands还二！你们还记得他吗？

156
00:12:05,024 --> 00:12:06,355
Baby Hands

157
00:12:08,427 --> 00:12:10,156
你们知道Eddie是怎么和她分的吗？

158
00:12:10,696 --> 00:12:13,893
他约了她最好的朋友，她今晚也在这儿

159
00:12:13,999 --> 00:12:15,933
Sheila，起立

160
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:23,065
但是……

161
00:12:23,175 --> 00:12:24,699
但是

162
00:12:25,845 --> 00:12:29,941
当Eddie在同学聚会上看见Daisy时

163
00:12:30,049 --> 00:12:32,517
他意识到他犯了一个很大的错误

164
00:12:32,618 --> 00:12:33,846
我没有恶意，Sheila

165
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:36,554
而现在，Eddie真棒

166
00:12:36,655 --> 00:12:38,623
他变了很多

167
00:12:38,724 --> 00:12:41,750
除了他那张脸没变

168
00:12:45,131 --> 00:12:48,100
上帝！我真希望能回到高中同学聚会

169
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,531
但我留长留海了

170
00:12:50,669 --> 00:12:54,105
我一直在留留海。不要留海！

171
00:12:58,010 --> 00:13:01,002
那么，敬Daisy和Eddie！

173
00:13:12,091 --> 00:13:15,822
敬Daisy和Eddie，还有你的单身！

174
00:13:15,928 --> 00:13:17,293
敬Daisy和Eddie！

175
00:13:17,396 --> 00:13:19,364
敬Daisy和Eddie！

176
00:13:22,268 --> 00:13:24,065
Ok，现在是游戏时间

177
00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:26,638
- 游戏？蒸的吗？ - 当然！

178
00:13:26,739 --> 00:13:30,971
但是，玩什么呢？玩什么呢？

179
00:13:31,076 --> 00:13:33,476
我们来写“你睡过几个”

180
00:13:33,579 --> 00:13:35,103
- 好想法，Katie - 虾米？

181
00:13:35,214 --> 00:13:38,615
Ok，我们只需要几张纸还有饮料。马上回来！

182
00:13:44,156 --> 00:13:46,954
城市里有这么多酒吧
（卡萨布兰卡经典台词，原文：Of all the gin joints, in all the towns, in all the world, she walks into mine.全世界有这么多城市，城市里有这么多酒吧，可她却偏偏来到我的酒吧。）

183
00:13:47,092 --> 00:13:50,084
全世界有这么多陈词滥调
（卡萨布兰卡经典台词，原文：Of all the gin joints, in all the towns, in all the world, she walks into mine.全世界有这么多城市，城市里有这么多酒吧，可她却偏偏来到我的酒吧。）

184
00:13:51,397 --> 00:13:54,730
我不知道让你被解雇有那么难

185
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:59,036
我不必再去嘲笑你，因为你不再是我的老板了

186
00:13:59,138 --> 00:14:02,039
我来埋单，今天感觉糟透了

187
00:14:02,875 --> 00:14:04,035
是吗？

188
00:14:04,143 --> 00:14:06,338
谢了，再说我也付不起

189
00:14:06,445 --> 00:14:07,912
我能跟你说实话吗？

190
00:14:08,013 --> 00:14:10,243
你怎么看都不喜欢做营销

191
00:14:10,349 --> 00:14:11,373
我喜欢

192
00:14:11,483 --> 00:14:13,041
是，但你不爱它

193
00:14:13,152 --> 00:14:14,949
我想我帮了你个忙

194
00:14:15,087 --> 00:14:19,581
现在你可以去找一份你喜欢的工作，为你喜欢的老板工作

195
00:14:20,659 --> 00:14:21,717
我喜欢你

196
00:14:22,061 --> 00:14:24,359
真的吗？有多喜欢？

197
00:14:27,399 --> 00:14:28,798
她买了一整瓶，是吗？

198
00:14:31,403 --> 00:14:33,394
Ok，只要写下“你睡过几个”

199
00:14:33,505 --> 00:14:35,336
然后扔到玻璃杯里

200
00:14:35,441 --> 00:14:38,467
然后我们一人拿一张，看看这张纸是谁的

201
00:14:38,577 --> 00:14:39,771
Daisy，你先来

203
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:43,640
4个

204
00:14:43,749 --> 00:14:45,011
- 哦，是我 - 呀！

205
00:14:45,117 --> 00:14:47,142
不不不，不该这样玩儿！

206
00:14:47,253 --> 00:14:48,277
我们要猜！

207
00:14:48,387 --> 00:14:51,185
谁不要猜Katie？她好像12岁就嫁给了Matt

208
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:53,758
- 我很吃惊你还睡过那么多！ - 好吧！

209
00:14:53,859 --> 00:14:55,326
Katie，到你了！

210
00:14:57,162 --> 00:14:59,858
8个……是Daisy！

211
00:14:59,999 --> 00:15:02,797
好吧，我比你多一倍

212
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:04,862
6个

213
00:15:05,404 --> 00:15:07,304
- Jamie？ - 是，那是我的

214
00:15:07,706 --> 00:15:09,173
等等，你睡过7个

215
00:15:09,708 --> 00:15:12,370
- 我没和Lars睡过！- 你睡过了！

216
00:15:12,478 --> 00:15:15,311
不，他只X进去一小点，所以不算

217
00:15:15,414 --> 00:15:17,678
-X进去多少？- 那么多

218
00:15:18,517 --> 00:15:21,384
什么意思？完全是在放屁，我又不知道Lars的那根有多大？

219
00:15:21,487 --> 00:15:23,546
我知道，算进去

220
00:15:23,656 --> 00:15:25,954
Ok，那么要X进去多少才算？

221
00:15:26,058 --> 00:15:27,719
X进去就算

222
00:15:27,826 --> 00:15:30,192
好吧，7个。不，8个

223
00:15:30,296 --> 00:15:32,025
- 他妈的，8个 - 不错嘛

224
00:15:32,131 --> 00:15:33,530
Ok，Jamie，到你了

226
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:38,028
13个

227
00:15:38,137 --> 00:15:40,332
13个？谁睡过13个？

228
00:15:40,439 --> 00:15:41,406
我

229
00:15:41,507 --> 00:15:43,202
- 你个贱货！ - 你没用了！荡妇！

230
00:15:43,309 --> 00:15:44,674
- Sheila！- 荡妇！

231
00:15:45,577 --> 00:15:47,067
你个淫荡的贱货！

232
00:15:47,179 --> 00:15:48,305
有什么大不了的？

233
00:15:48,447 --> 00:15:51,644
有13根金箍棒X进过同一个洞啊！

234
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:54,719
又不是同时一起进的

235
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:57,812
你知道个屁啊！我过了。Ally，到你了

236
00:15:58,190 --> 00:16:00,181
Ok

238
00:16:10,135 --> 00:16:11,159
哦！

239
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:12,862
哇，看看，9个

240
00:16:13,439 --> 00:16:15,304
我写了我自己的。Game over了！

241
00:16:15,407 --> 00:16:17,534
等等，有一个“1”，是你的吗？

242
00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:20,509
- 额…… - 哦，佛祖啊

243
00:16:20,612 --> 00:16:22,045
你睡过91个！

244
00:16:22,147 --> 00:16:24,172
没有，是9个！

245
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:26,217
你睡过19个

246
00:16:26,719 --> 00:16:27,913
19个！

247
00:16:31,123 --> 00:16:32,613
Hello，盆友！

248
00:16:32,925 --> 00:16:34,859
好吧，我承认，我睡过19个

249
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:37,827
到了全国平均值的两倍，悲剧……

250
00:16:37,930 --> 00:16:41,388
看看，在《嘉人》上有一整篇文章说这个

251
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:44,560
我还以为玩这个游戏会让我对“数字”好过一点

252
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:47,969
但我觉得火车上无家可归的老太太是对的。我睡过的太多了！

253
00:16:48,073 --> 00:16:50,132
很显然，在美国有96%的……

254
00:16:50,242 --> 00:16:54,110
睡过20个或以上的女人找不到男人

255
00:16:54,213 --> 00:16:55,805
- 它写的真是20个吗？ - 恩

256
00:16:55,914 --> 00:16:57,279
管他的，谁做的研究啊？

257
00:16:57,383 --> 00:16:59,544
科学家会上《嘉人》吗？

258
00:16:59,718 --> 00:17:02,619
嘿，这本杂志教我如何达到高潮！

259
00:17:02,721 --> 00:17:05,622
实际上，这项研究是Helen Fig博士做的

260
00:17:05,724 --> 00:17:08,192
一位哈佛大学的博士后研究员

261
00:17:08,293 --> 00:17:09,282
Shit！

262
00:17:09,661 --> 00:17:11,686
我总是在我的实践中看到

263
00:17:11,797 --> 00:17:14,197
当你过度性成熟，它会扰乱你的自尊

264
00:17:14,299 --> 00:17:18,531
接下来，你45了，没有自尊，没有老公

265
00:17:18,637 --> 00:17:20,764
骨盆底不会肌紧张

266
00:17:22,307 --> 00:17:25,037
好吧，但我是不会这样的

267
00:17:25,144 --> 00:17:26,771
哈佛说20就是极限

268
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:30,246
我睡过19个，说明我还有机会

269
00:17:32,017 --> 00:17:33,143
Ok

270
00:17:33,252 --> 00:17:34,719
我要做一份声明

271
00:17:36,288 --> 00:17:38,279
闭嘴，我在做声明

272
00:17:39,825 --> 00:17:44,853
我再也不会和任何一个上床，除非我确定他就是我的唯一

273
00:17:45,464 --> 00:17:46,726
我可能不会太多控制

274
00:17:46,832 --> 00:17:49,665
但我绝对会控制我的骨盆底

275
00:17:50,502 --> 00:17:53,596
那个参观过我的希望之家的人
（casa (de) esperanza，西班牙语，意为house of hope）

276
00:17:53,705 --> 00:17:55,673
就是我的丈夫

277
00:17:55,774 --> 00:17:57,036
- 不错！ - Yeah

278
00:17:57,142 --> 00:18:00,543
敬对自己命运的掌握！

279
00:18:00,646 --> 00:18:02,773
敬对自己命运的掌握！

280
00:18:07,719 --> 00:18:11,485
敬更好的作出决定和贯彻目标

281
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:14,753
敬更好的作出决定和目标~！

282
00:18:15,194 --> 00:18:16,889
敬第20个！

283
00:18:17,129 --> 00:18:18,323
敬第20个！

284
00:19:00,806 --> 00:19:02,171
哦，天哪……

285
00:19:11,316 --> 00:19:14,251
哦，不，我的天哪……

286
00:19:18,891 --> 00:19:19,915
嗨

287
00:19:20,025 --> 00:19:22,619
- 我和我的前老板睡了……- Carol？

288
00:19:22,728 --> 00:19:24,923
我刚被炒的那个工作

289
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:27,498
- 你被FIRE了？- 都是你的错！

290
00:19:27,599 --> 00:19:30,227
昨晚，当我试图带你走的时候，你吐了我一身

291
00:19:30,536 --> 00:19:31,969
但是……恭喜了

292
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:34,038
你说第20个就是你的老公，现在你睡过第20个啦

293
00:19:34,306 --> 00:19:35,933
- 闭嘴！- 我必须承认

294
00:19:36,041 --> 00:19:38,305
我没有想到你会那么快

295
00:19:38,410 --> 00:19:39,399
但是我好兴奋哦

296
00:19:39,645 --> 00:19:42,375
嘿，Eddie，Ally要结婚了

297
00:19:42,514 --> 00:19:44,072
- 不错！- 他很激动！

298
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:46,879
我知道你是个贱货，但是他可能是我的老公

299
00:19:46,985 --> 00:19:50,250
也许，这就是命吧，现在我们有了一个可以讲给我们孙子的故事了

300
00:19:53,258 --> 00:19:56,284
我不知道为什么之前我没有考虑过他

301
00:20:03,368 --> 00:20:04,665
他不是我老公！！！！！！！

302
00:20:10,609 --> 00:20:12,270
- 早上好！ - 早上好！

303
00:20:12,377 --> 00:20:14,470
- 你厕所里的纸没了 - Ok

304
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:15,877
你煮咖啡了吗？

305
00:20:16,014 --> 00:20:18,346
没有，在你去厕所的路上有一家星巴克

306
00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:20,975
好吧，你有报纸吗？

307
00:20:21,086 --> 00:20:22,348
米有

308
00:20:24,823 --> 00:20:26,518
- 早上好，6-C。- 这不是我的

309
00:20:27,259 --> 00:20:30,023
好吧，我被锁外面了

310
00:20:30,128 --> 00:20:33,825
什么钥匙、钱包都锁里面了。借你电话一用

311
00:20:33,932 --> 00:20:36,127
当然，等我拿给你

312
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:37,896
Roger，我们待会儿再聊

313
00:20:38,003 --> 00:20:40,471
因为现在6-A需要帮助

314
00:20:40,572 --> 00:20:41,903
- Colin - 嗨

315
00:20:42,207 --> 00:20:43,936
- 很高兴认识你 - 恩

316
00:20:47,846 --> 00:20:49,074
那么

317
00:20:50,382 --> 00:20:51,815
今晚一起吃饭怎样？

318
00:20:53,151 --> 00:20:55,210
- 今晚？- 恩

319
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:58,118
今晚我们有居民会议

320
00:20:59,224 --> 00:21:01,715
哦，是的，居民会议

321
00:21:03,562 --> 00:21:06,656
我们在想办法把那只吵人的鸟赶出去

322
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:11,863
我们想出办法以后再call你

323
00:21:11,970 --> 00:21:16,498
也许是我们下次再见面的时候

324
00:21:16,608 --> 00:21:17,597
Ok

325
00:21:27,219 --> 00:21:28,550
拜

326
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,325
嗨，我叫Roger

327
00:21:37,195 --> 00:21:39,493
嘿，你不觉得走出你公寓的那个女人

328
00:21:39,598 --> 00:21:41,828
可以解决你“被锁外面”的问题吗？

329
00:21:45,003 --> 00:21:46,095
Ok

330
00:21:46,204 --> 00:21:49,071
出了一点小状况，我需要隐蔽

331
00:21:49,174 --> 00:21:51,199
额……不像你这里的情况，所以我……

332
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:53,403
骗了她，然后再骗我？

333
00:21:53,545 --> 00:21:56,514
我所考虑的是试图回避她的感情

334
00:21:57,849 --> 00:21:58,838
哇

335
00:21:58,950 --> 00:22:00,679
真不错，你从哪儿买的？

336
00:22:00,786 --> 00:22:02,117
我自己做的

337
00:22:02,954 --> 00:22:04,922
- 不可能 - 才怪

338
00:22:05,057 --> 00:22:06,922
听着，我不想和你的“睡波士顿所有的女人”运动

339
00:22:07,025 --> 00:22:09,687
有任何联系，Ok？

340
00:22:09,795 --> 00:22:11,126
他们有点象我的姐妹

341
00:22:11,630 --> 00:22:13,598
哇，我以为你比他们NB多了

342
00:22:13,699 --> 00:22:15,223
我在YouTube上看见你的祝酒词了

343
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:16,961
看起来你很有幽默感

344
00:22:17,069 --> 00:22:19,333
那些贱货把我的祝酒词贴在YouTube上？

345
00:22:20,072 --> 00:22:21,596
你怎么就看了呢？

346
00:22:21,707 --> 00:22:23,868
我在Google快讯上找到了这栋楼的每一个人！

347
00:22:24,176 --> 00:22:26,906
我来自警察之家，所以“挖东西”是我的天性

348
00:22:27,346 --> 00:22:30,179
4-D的那家伙要把他的狗嫁了

349
00:22:30,282 --> 00:22:32,250
- 不！那土匪？ - 是啊

350
00:22:33,185 --> 00:22:37,178
好了，好像海岸线安全了

351
00:22:37,289 --> 00:22:39,382
谢了，桃子（Peach）

352
00:22:39,491 --> 00:22:40,549
不谢，猪（Pig）

354
00:22:50,302 --> 00:22:51,326
真好吃

355
00:22:51,470 --> 00:22:55,463
好了，够了。我认为只是来试吃奶油的

356
00:22:56,007 --> 00:22:58,066
为什么？没有人想再看我的裸体

357
00:22:58,176 --> 00:22:59,302
我也会很享受啊

358
00:22:59,444 --> 00:23:02,777
恩，像是你真的要成为独身主义者一样

359
00:23:02,881 --> 00:23:05,475
我没得选，我说过要在第20个面前停止

360
00:23:05,584 --> 00:23:09,281
现在呢，我真的要感谢那个闻手指的八辈儿祖宗来X我
我睡过20个了

361
00:23:09,388 --> 00:23:11,413
你保证，不要把我放在单身的那桌

362
00:23:11,523 --> 00:23:13,855
和Sheila和他妈，谢谢了

363
00:23:13,959 --> 00:23:16,484
座位真的复杂

365
00:23:20,132 --> 00:23:21,793
等等

366
00:23:21,933 --> 00:23:24,868
- 那家伙你看起来眼熟吗？- 不

367
00:23:26,505 --> 00:23:28,132
哦，天哪

368
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,867
什么？

369
00:23:29,975 --> 00:23:33,240
那是让人恶心的Donald！我和他约过会

370
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:37,440
- 我见过他吗？- 没人见过

371
00:23:39,618 --> 00:23:42,018
因为他我才学的烹饪！

372
00:23:42,888 --> 00:23:46,449
没吃的了，宝贝，今晚我们出去吃吧

373
00:23:47,926 --> 00:23:52,158
我不知道，外面好多人呢！

374
00:23:52,264 --> 00:23:55,722
走嘛，我想试试那家人人都在议论的韩国铁板烧！

375
00:23:55,834 --> 00:23:58,064
我会做韩国铁板烧啊，需要些什么？

376
00:23:58,170 --> 00:24:00,968
可以烧烤的桌子

377
00:24:01,373 --> 00:24:05,173
那人看起来根本不恶心啊，而且他看上去还很可爱

378
00:24:05,310 --> 00:24:07,039
我知道，但就是他啊！

379
00:24:07,145 --> 00:24:09,613
好啊，上去打个招呼吧

381
00:24:22,761 --> 00:24:24,160
Ally？

382
00:24:24,329 --> 00:24:26,354
- Donald？- 我的佛祖啊！

383
00:24:26,465 --> 00:24:27,727
- 是你啊！- 嗨

384
00:24:27,833 --> 00:24:32,327
我无法相信自己的眼睛啊！

386
00:24:36,808 --> 00:24:39,868
哦，Ally这是我的未婚妻，Cara

387
00:24:40,011 --> 00:24:41,000
- 嗨 - 这是Ally

388
00:24:41,112 --> 00:24:43,376
- 很高兴认识你 - 我也是

389
00:24:43,482 --> 00:24:47,680
哇，那么你们是怎么认识的？

390
00:24:48,954 --> 00:24:50,888
- 在一次会议上 - 在一次会议上

391
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:53,583
你能相信吗？她是一个火箭科学家

392
00:24:53,692 --> 00:24:55,182
- 我才不是呢 - 是的，你是

393
00:24:55,293 --> 00:24:58,421
实际上，我只是一个工程师，但他喜欢那样说

394
00:24:58,530 --> 00:25:01,397
- 我不是典型的……- 我懂我懂

395
00:25:02,434 --> 00:25:04,299
我和Ally是老朋友了

396
00:25:05,804 --> 00:25:07,738
那么，你在这干嘛？

397
00:25:08,874 --> 00:25:12,071
我只是在试一些蛋糕

398
00:25:12,777 --> 00:25:14,210
为我的婚礼

399
00:25:14,779 --> 00:25:16,838
- 哦！ - 我也是要嫁给一位科学家

400
00:25:18,149 --> 00:25:20,640
他也是看起来也不大精干

401
00:25:20,952 --> 00:25:22,385
我和我妹妹在一起

402
00:25:22,487 --> 00:25:27,948
因为他决定在北极处理整个冰盖的情况

403
00:25:28,727 --> 00:25:29,751
- 哦 - 是的

404
00:25:29,995 --> 00:25:32,054
他大概会做好的

405
00:25:32,430 --> 00:25:34,728
我无法相信他说我们只是朋友

406
00:25:34,833 --> 00:25:36,164
就像是我就是令人尴尬的人

407
00:25:36,301 --> 00:25:38,565
他有了男人的胸，好多毛的那种

408
00:25:38,703 --> 00:25:40,136
天哪，我真无法相信他们是同一个人

409
00:25:40,238 --> 00:25:42,035
他现在看起来多棒，甚至看起来更高了

410
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:43,539
许多男人会随着年龄的增长变得越来越不错

411
00:25:43,642 --> 00:25:46,338
你在说你自己的吧，Eddie以前真是个二逼

412
00:25:46,444 --> 00:25:47,911
人是会变的

413
00:25:49,681 --> 00:25:50,978
你说对了

414
00:25:51,082 --> 00:25:52,515
Daisy，你是个天才

415
00:25:52,617 --> 00:25:54,312
我不必起当单身主义者或者是过“20”了

416
00:25:54,419 --> 00:25:55,613
什么意思？

417
00:25:55,954 --> 00:25:58,718
Donald不会是唯一一个随着时间而改变的前男朋友！

418
00:25:58,957 --> 00:26:00,390
Ok

419
00:26:01,126 --> 00:26:02,559
爱你

420
00:26:14,339 --> 00:26:15,465
好了

421
00:26:21,246 --> 00:26:22,838
Ok，哈

422
00:26:23,081 --> 00:26:24,139
Jake Adams的老爸

423
00:26:24,716 --> 00:26:25,944
Jake Adams的Facebook.

424
00:26:27,552 --> 00:26:28,849
Ok

425
00:26:29,554 --> 00:26:30,987
Jake Adams三世

426
00:26:31,089 --> 00:26:33,080
不，Jake Adams四世

427
00:26:33,191 --> 00:26:36,422
哦，算了吧，继续吧

428
00:26:38,396 --> 00:26:40,023
下一个是谁？

429
00:26:40,498 --> 00:26:42,466
Mike Miller

430
00:26:43,501 --> 00:26:45,298
1100万条搜索结果？

431
00:26:45,904 --> 00:26:47,337
他妈的

432
00:26:48,873 --> 00:26:51,808
来自新泽西州Cresskill

433
00:26:52,677 --> 00:26:55,840
800万条搜索结果？搞什么J8啊？

434
00:26:55,947 --> 00:27:00,145
Mike Miller，来自新泽西州Cresskill，对Bruce Springsteen痴迷

435
00:27:00,251 --> 00:27:03,049
蛋大，但棒小

436
00:27:05,390 --> 00:27:07,324
什么啊，不，天哪！

437
00:27:07,993 --> 00:27:09,984
给我停下来！

438
00:27:16,368 --> 00:27:17,426
拜拜

439
00:27:36,254 --> 00:27:37,585
蛋……

441
00:27:41,693 --> 00:27:43,820
这不是我的错

442
00:27:46,498 --> 00:27:47,795
我告诉过你不要放这儿

443
00:27:50,101 --> 00:27:51,500
放床下

444
00:27:52,470 --> 00:27:53,494
嗨

445
00:27:53,605 --> 00:27:55,436
早上好，6-C

446
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:57,770
嘿，你又有来访者了！

447
00:27:57,876 --> 00:28:00,709
我只是想很速度的问你个问题

448
00:28:00,812 --> 00:28:02,871
记得你说过你善于“挖东西”吗？

449
00:28:02,981 --> 00:28:06,417
我可以付给你钱让你帮我找些人，你觉得呢？

450
00:28:06,851 --> 00:28:10,116
亲爱的，如果你要我帮你，你该多给我点资料啊

451
00:28:10,221 --> 00:28:12,155
就是些和我约过会的

452
00:28:12,691 --> 00:28:14,886
哦，你有疱疹啊，这样做决定可不好玩

453
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:16,659
没有，只是……

454
00:28:16,761 --> 00:28:17,785
怎么说呢？

455
00:28:17,896 --> 00:28:21,627
只是我觉得其中一个值得来第二次

456
00:28:31,242 --> 00:28:33,574
不，我拒绝当二逼

457
00:28:33,678 --> 00:28:36,408
我不知道为什么他们和你掰了，但我必须保护他们

458
00:28:37,248 --> 00:28:39,307
停！你为什么都在假设是他们和我掰了？

459
00:28:40,085 --> 00:28:42,849
因为你像那种会做“坏事”的女生

460
00:28:43,354 --> 00:28:44,844
但有人称之为乐观主义啊

461
00:28:45,023 --> 00:28:47,014
我认为就是二

462
00:28:47,125 --> 00:28:49,355
浪费口水，我就知道你是个混蛋

463
00:28:49,461 --> 00:28:52,157
别气啊，我又没说不和你睡

464
00:28:52,330 --> 00:28:53,797
额……真他妈恶心！

465
00:29:09,647 --> 00:29:12,912
Colin！Colin，快开门啊，Colin！

466
00:29:14,252 --> 00:29:16,618
Colin快走！妈在浴盆里跌倒了！

467
00:29:16,755 --> 00:29:19,085
- 什么？- 是啊，她倒在浴盆里了！

468
00:29:19,190 --> 00:29:20,282
嗨

469
00:29:20,391 --> 00:29:24,327
她现在在医院，她全身都……湿了

470
00:29:25,630 --> 00:29:26,892
我们要快点！

471
00:29:26,998 --> 00:29:29,592
现在估计他们正在帮她烘干

472
00:29:29,701 --> 00:29:32,568
抱歉了，你看起来真的很棒

473
00:29:33,138 --> 00:29:35,470
我保证他会打电话给你的，但我们现在要走了

474
00:29:35,573 --> 00:29:37,666
快点，她zen的搜桑了！

475
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:43,144
给人印象深刻

476
00:29:43,248 --> 00:29:44,476
恩

477
00:29:44,749 --> 00:29:47,877
你帮我去找我的前男友，我帮你甩掉你的女友

478
00:29:48,753 --> 00:29:51,278
怎么不保护你的姐妹了？

479
00:29:51,422 --> 00:29:54,186
如果她们没看见你来了，她们活该

480
00:29:54,292 --> 00:29:55,782
佛祖啊

481
00:29:56,261 --> 00:29:59,128
房间是排成一条线的啊，有木有

482
00:30:00,498 --> 00:30:03,023
并且这儿就是你的避难所了

483
00:30:05,036 --> 00:30:06,697
- 给你 - 谢谢

484
00:30:06,805 --> 00:30:09,171
谢了，Diana

485
00:30:09,274 --> 00:30:11,333
以下是那些人的资料

486
00:30:11,442 --> 00:30:13,239
姓名，目前的电话号码

487
00:30:13,344 --> 00:30:15,676
在听吗？还有地址

488
00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:19,682
找出谁还活着，谁还没娶，还有就是要住在东海岸
（波士顿在美国东海岸），Ok？

489
00:30:19,784 --> 00:30:21,979
我去找车，或者是火车，别想要飞机

490
00:30:22,554 --> 00:30:25,546
我按重要性贴出了个单子，从头开始

491
00:30:25,657 --> 00:30:28,182
Jake Adams，跑掉的那个？

492
00:30:28,293 --> 00:30:30,261
可以这么说

493
00:30:30,361 --> 00:30:33,455
他和他老爹的名字一样，而且是半个波士顿人

494
00:30:33,565 --> 00:30:36,261
- 所以他很容易找到 - Jake Adams一家？

495
00:30:36,901 --> 00:30:37,993
他可能不难找

496
00:30:38,102 --> 00:30:39,433
但我保证他很难搞定

497
00:30:39,904 --> 00:30:41,838
你没有电话地址之类的吗？

498
00:30:41,973 --> 00:30:44,066
如果我有，你就可以滚了

499
00:30:44,175 --> 00:30:47,372
我只知道Tom Piper快要党参议员了

500
00:30:47,478 --> 00:30:49,810
还有，把John Kimble挪到第三位

501
00:30:49,914 --> 00:30:53,042
他可能还在星巴克工作，但是他是让我感觉最性福的一个

502
00:30:53,151 --> 00:30:54,448
你还没和我上过呢

503
00:30:54,586 --> 00:30:57,783
不，但是我和那些过度自信却又挣扎得要死的搞音乐的上过

504
00:30:57,889 --> 00:30:59,254
所以，我还不错啦

505
00:30:59,357 --> 00:31:00,984
是什么让你觉得我是个搞音乐的？

506
00:31:01,092 --> 00:31:04,118
你公寓里的吉他，还有就是你的穿着像一个好色的年轻人

507
00:31:04,229 --> 00:31:06,163
我付了三明治的钱，你个死搞音乐的

508
00:31:06,631 --> 00:31:08,121
我还是不懂，你何必那么麻烦？

509
00:31:08,233 --> 00:31:09,359
重新找一新的不就结了

510
00:31:09,467 --> 00:31:11,697
不，不要新的

511
00:31:11,803 --> 00:31:13,498
新的总比旧的好

512
00:31:13,605 --> 00:31:14,867
对于你来说

513
00:31:14,973 --> 00:31:17,942
我敢打赌和你相处最长时间的是三明治

516
00:31:34,959 --> 00:31:36,654
- 真漂酿！- 是啊

517
00:31:36,828 --> 00:31:39,353
你真打算让我们在你的婚礼上穿的漂漂亮亮的吗？

518
00:31:40,231 --> 00:31:43,894
没有，这件是老妈的，那些才是伴娘礼服

519
00:31:45,603 --> 00:31:46,934
Sorry啦，被老妈挑走了

520
00:31:47,038 --> 00:31:48,596
我要哄着她嘛

521
00:31:48,706 --> 00:31:50,469
因为我请老爸了

522
00:31:50,575 --> 00:31:53,476
- 你告诉她了吗？ - 还没

523
00:31:55,246 --> 00:31:57,237
Oh, wow!

524
00:31:57,348 --> 00:31:58,610
我认为这件不错，是吧？

525
00:32:01,686 --> 00:32:03,085
真漂酿！

526
00:32:03,187 --> 00:32:05,155
- 是啊 - 我爱死这件婚纱了

527
00:32:05,256 --> 00:32:06,848
好多“纱”啊

528
00:32:07,492 --> 00:32:09,119
我就喜欢

529
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:11,885
你不会想入洞房还穿着吧？

530
00:32:11,996 --> 00:32:14,931
- 我不知道了，看情况 - 你那么淫荡，你当然会

531
00:32:15,033 --> 00:32:16,762
我只是在担心，这个婚纱一层又一层

532
00:32:16,868 --> 00:32:18,631
我怕他找不到洞

533
00:32:18,736 --> 00:32:21,102
- 有道理 - 我是说，别想69式了

534
00:32:21,205 --> 00:32:24,333
他不会的

535
00:32:24,442 --> 00:32:27,309
- 维森么呢？- 因为她是成年人了

536
00:32:27,412 --> 00:32:29,107
69式适合你17岁用

537
00:32:29,213 --> 00:32:32,649
你想在你父母回家之前一次性把那个塞进去

538
00:32:32,750 --> 00:32:33,876
谢了

539
00:32:33,985 --> 00:32:37,614
Matt他就是喜欢这个，然后我就说，“轮流来吧”

540
00:32:37,722 --> 00:32:39,587
“着什么急”

541
00:32:39,691 --> 00:32:41,591
哦，我的佛祖啊，他找到了Dave Hansen

542
00:32:41,693 --> 00:32:44,184
你在追踪你所有的前男友

543
00:32:44,295 --> 00:32:46,456
然后就不用睡第21个了？

544
00:32:46,564 --> 00:32:47,861
- 什么？- 你想想啊

545
00:32:47,966 --> 00:32:49,433
如果其中有一个成功

546
00:32:49,534 --> 00:32:51,627
那就意味着我的一生就不会被浪费了

547
00:32:51,736 --> 00:32:53,567
是啊，但你不会成功的

548
00:32:53,671 --> 00:32:55,400
应为他们都对不起你过

549
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:58,566
Dave Hansen，跟你谈过的那个魔术师吗？

550
00:33:04,415 --> 00:33:06,349
这是你的吧

551
00:33:14,192 --> 00:33:16,387
这些都是你的吧

552
00:33:20,965 --> 00:33:23,160
哇，你很效率嘛

553
00:33:23,267 --> 00:33:25,895
这很容易，他有自己的网站

554
00:33:26,004 --> 00:33:27,471
supersexymagic.com

555
00:33:29,607 --> 00:33:31,598
我想我可以找到他

556
00:33:31,743 --> 00:33:34,678
所以你可以消失了

557
00:33:34,779 --> 00:33:36,406
然后错过好戏吗？

558
00:33:43,521 --> 00:33:45,148
不错啊！

559
00:33:48,059 --> 00:33:50,527
好了，我走了

560
00:33:50,628 --> 00:33:51,652
那么快

561
00:33:53,831 --> 00:33:56,197
怎么了？因为他是个吧台招待？

562
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:58,268
不，是因为他一直是吧台招待

563
00:33:58,369 --> 00:34:00,337
他就站在他九年前站着的地方

564
00:34:00,438 --> 00:34:04,841
一个失业的魔术师睡到中午，然后当吧台招待当到三点

565
00:34:04,942 --> 00:34:06,876
到处撒硬币给人们

566
00:34:06,978 --> 00:34:08,468
还有，他拿着你的25分钱硬币

567
00:34:08,579 --> 00:34:12,106
那又怎样？你本可以为了以前而享受一下啊

568
00:34:12,216 --> 00:34:14,047
即使没有增加“我睡过”的人数

569
00:34:14,218 --> 00:34:16,686
我也在那种人身上浪费不起时间

570
00:34:16,788 --> 00:34:18,380
停！这就是原因吗？

571
00:34:18,489 --> 00:34:23,620
你不想再增加“睡过”的人数，所以你不和我睡

572
00:34:23,728 --> 00:34:27,164
没有，不和你睡的原因多了去了

573
00:34:27,265 --> 00:34:28,562
不多

574
00:34:28,933 --> 00:34:31,401
我不知道为什么你们那么在乎睡过多少个？

575
00:34:31,502 --> 00:34:34,835
你们总有你们心中的理想女孩

576
00:34:34,939 --> 00:34:38,932
如果我们睡过太多，就成为不了了

577
00:34:39,043 --> 00:34:41,409
理想女孩？说说看

578
00:34:41,512 --> 00:34:44,037
你可以把他带回家

579
00:34:44,148 --> 00:34:48,551
她很聪明，但没你聪明，然后他会和你妈妈烤苹果派

580
00:34:48,653 --> 00:34:50,245
和你的弱智妹妹玩传接球游戏

581
00:34:50,354 --> 00:34:52,618
但是当你一个人的时候，她会脱掉她的眼睛

582
00:34:52,723 --> 00:34:54,918
穿着性爱内衣从你侧边挑逗你

583
00:34:55,026 --> 00:34:57,722
那种女孩不存在，如果有，我绝对要睡她

584
00:34:57,829 --> 00:35:01,321
话说回来，什么人会在乎你们睡过多少个啊？

585
00:35:01,432 --> 00:35:02,831
正经的人

586
00:35:26,557 --> 00:35:29,822
嘿，你在干神马！

587
00:35:31,195 --> 00:35:32,423
等……

588
00:35:33,998 --> 00:35:35,329
Amy走掉

589
00:35:35,433 --> 00:35:38,334
昨晚你又上了一个！

590
00:35:38,436 --> 00:35:40,370
“上”这个词好粗糙啊

591
00:35:40,471 --> 00:35:42,769
我们分享了一份浪漫的经历

592
00:35:43,341 --> 00:35:45,571
然后我告诉她，我约了牙医

593
00:35:45,676 --> 00:35:48,440
然后我在你沙发上躲着直到她离开

594
00:35:48,546 --> 00:35:52,983
那么你可以充分利用这段“停工期”来做点实际工作

595
00:35:53,084 --> 00:35:56,212
我在工作啊，我帮你在Facebook上申请了个账号

596
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:59,812
我不想上“Facebook”，你贴上去些什么照片？

597
00:35:59,924 --> 00:36:01,391
你刚才睡觉的一张照片

598
00:36:01,893 --> 00:36:03,087
我认为这样更好

599
00:36:03,194 --> 00:36:04,923
在你找他们的时候，他们也可以来找你

600
00:36:05,029 --> 00:36:06,462
好吧，但我不要“Twitter”

601
00:36:06,564 --> 00:36:07,588
哦

602
00:36:07,698 --> 00:36:10,997
第14号Evan Slater刚才@你了

603
00:36:11,102 --> 00:36:12,831
他在一张照片上标签了你

604
00:36:12,937 --> 00:36:16,202
他邀请你成为Tito's Tacos的粉丝
（Tito's Tacos：Tito家的墨西哥玉米饼店）

605
00:36:16,374 --> 00:36:18,274
哦，我喜欢Evan

606
00:36:18,376 --> 00:36:20,310
是啊，谁不喜欢墨西哥玉米饼？

607
00:36:20,945 --> 00:36:22,913
他很讨人喜欢

608
00:36:26,083 --> 00:36:28,608
他老婆和孩子也是……

609
00:36:28,719 --> 00:36:31,415
他完全不知道“Facebook”是用来做什么滴！

610
00:36:31,522 --> 00:36:33,547
如果你不把这项工作当回事

611
00:36:33,658 --> 00:36:36,183
你可以滚了

612
00:36:36,994 --> 00:36:38,188
我的咖啡壶呢？

613
00:36:38,296 --> 00:36:39,661
被我(卒瓦)了

614
00:36:40,031 --> 00:36:42,056
如果你用Twitter，你就会知道了

615
00:36:46,771 --> 00:36:48,864
你欠我19.95美元

616
00:36:48,973 --> 00:36:50,907
我用中国菜赔你，怎样？

617
00:36:51,008 --> 00:36:52,498
我定了蓉园餐厅的菜

618
00:36:52,610 --> 00:36:54,407
有小排骨吗？

619
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:57,011
Ok，我五分钟后到

620
00:36:58,416 --> 00:36:59,508
嘿

621
00:36:59,817 --> 00:37:01,375
嘿，快进来吧

622
00:37:08,893 --> 00:37:10,656
- 哇 - Yeah

623
00:37:11,062 --> 00:37:12,791
我老爹不经常带我去看球

624
00:37:12,897 --> 00:37:15,388
但我们会做很多监视的工作

625
00:37:15,499 --> 00:37:16,932
棒透了

626
00:37:19,637 --> 00:37:21,798
那么，Mike Miller和Eric Hamilton结婚了

627
00:37:22,073 --> 00:37:25,270
Valerio也是，从意大利来的那家伙

628
00:37:25,509 --> 00:37:26,806
- 额……- 要梅子酱吗？

629
00:37:26,911 --> 00:37:28,401
恩，但不要芥末

630
00:37:28,512 --> 00:37:30,742
不要芥末？芥末最好吃了！

631
00:37:30,848 --> 00:37:32,110
除非你讨厌芥末

632
00:37:33,017 --> 00:37:34,746
有关于Jake Adams的事吗？

633
00:37:34,852 --> 00:37:36,410
米有，sorry

634
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:38,852
我告诉过你，有钱人都很善于保护自己的隐私

635
00:37:38,956 --> 00:37:40,150
耐心点，会找到他的

636
00:37:40,925 --> 00:37:42,722
那么Simon Forester呢？

637
00:37:42,827 --> 00:37:44,795
他分居了，并且房子刚上市

638
00:37:44,895 --> 00:37:47,523
所以我估计他离婚是指日可待了

639
00:37:47,698 --> 00:37:50,496
恩，Ok，就他吧

640
00:37:50,601 --> 00:37:51,932
Simon

641
00:37:52,069 --> 00:37:55,800
Ok，制定个什么计划？一个要离婚的男人……

642
00:37:56,507 --> 00:37:57,531
离婚……

643
00:37:59,777 --> 00:38:02,769
我可以找到他的律师，然后成为那个律师的助理

644
00:38:03,314 --> 00:38:07,580
或者是，简单点，去看看他的open house

645
00:38:09,387 --> 00:38:10,354
恩

646
00:38:10,454 --> 00:38:13,582
一个最近离婚的人所面临的挑战是怎么去找点乐子

647
00:38:13,691 --> 00:38:15,556
你要做的，就是让他性福一辈子

648
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:18,629
等他意识到自己恋爱了就晚了

649
00:38:18,763 --> 00:38:22,324
所以我就要掩盖拥有完美性爱的物质婚姻这个事实？

650
00:38:22,867 --> 00:38:26,030
- 恩，你会吹喇叭吗？ - 什么？

651
00:38:26,137 --> 00:38:28,537
放松，这是公事，我在帮你

652
00:38:28,639 --> 00:38:30,664
你硬要我回答的话，我很会吹

653
00:38:30,775 --> 00:38:32,936
这方面我还没完全弄明白

654
00:38:33,044 --> 00:38:35,808
我保证他会的，所以跳过吧

655
00:38:36,547 --> 00:38:38,606
好了，我想……是这儿吧

656
00:38:38,716 --> 00:38:40,047
- 准备好了？ - 恩

657
00:38:42,053 --> 00:38:45,045
这儿真不错，Simon做得很好

658
00:38:45,456 --> 00:38:48,016
房地产经纪人去哪儿了？

659
00:38:48,125 --> 00:38:49,456
Hello？

660
00:38:54,832 --> 00:38:55,821
这是……

661
00:38:57,335 --> 00:38:58,700
搞什么J……

662
00:38:58,869 --> 00:39:00,268
- Donald！- Ally！

663
00:39:00,371 --> 00:39:02,168
你他妈来我家干什么？

664
00:39:02,873 --> 00:39:03,931
额……

665
00:39:04,542 --> 00:39:08,546
门开着，我以为是open house

666
00:39:08,679 --> 00:39:12,775
不不不，这是我的房子，你现在在我家

667
00:39:12,983 --> 00:39:14,314
哦，原来如此

668
00:39:16,220 --> 00:39:19,621
我未婚夫Pierre从北极回来的时候

669
00:39:20,825 --> 00:39:23,487
打算和我买套房

670
00:39:23,594 --> 00:39:27,030
嘿，Ally能把照片换给我吗？

671
00:39:28,566 --> 00:39:31,194
哦，抱歉……Oops

672
00:39:46,650 --> 00:39:48,618
那就是令人恶心的Donald

673
00:39:48,719 --> 00:39:49,811
他看起来不恶心啊

674
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:52,684
我和他谈的那个时候很恶心，可以了吧

675
00:39:56,861 --> 00:39:58,488
天哪，那才是Simon

676
00:39:58,596 --> 00:40:01,656
他离了婚，看起来还是那么棒

677
00:40:09,707 --> 00:40:10,901
在点餐之前

678
00:40:11,008 --> 00:40:15,377
我觉得有必要解释，为什么一个单身、异性恋的男人

679
00:40:15,479 --> 00:40:17,811
会一个人来贝肯山喝茶

680
00:40:17,915 --> 00:40:19,678
恩……

681
00:40:19,784 --> 00:40:23,618
我太想家了，以至于想灭了所有关于英国的东西

682
00:40:31,295 --> 00:40:33,058
Ok，你可以滚了，我可以把他带走了

683
00:40:33,164 --> 00:40:34,563
- 别推我 - 快滚

684
00:40:34,665 --> 00:40:36,030
叫你别推我

685
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:38,500
- 快点滚 - 我说了叫你别推我

686
00:40:39,003 --> 00:40:40,436
Ally，是你吗，亲爱的？

687
00:40:41,572 --> 00:40:42,937
是你吗？

688
00:40:45,309 --> 00:40:47,436
Simon，你怎么在这？

689
00:40:48,379 --> 00:40:50,176
真巧啊

690
00:40:52,049 --> 00:40:53,414
见到你真好

691
00:40:53,517 --> 00:40:55,644
真的很好

692
00:40:55,753 --> 00:41:00,588
Simon，这是我邻居Colin，但他现在要走了（模仿英音）

693
00:41:00,691 --> 00:41:02,158
我才不走呢

694
00:41:02,259 --> 00:41:04,318
- 很荣幸见到你 - 不，是我我很荣幸

695
00:41:05,329 --> 00:41:06,523
哇

696
00:41:07,164 --> 00:41:09,098
见到你真的……

697
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:10,861
我们谈恋爱的时候你有那么漂亮吗？

698
00:41:11,235 --> 00:41:14,204
哦，我之后留刘海了（继续模仿英音）

699
00:41:14,872 --> 00:41:17,306
也就是留海，刘海(fringe)就是留海(bangs)

700
00:41:18,075 --> 00:41:20,805
- 美国人啊…… - 他们在展示我的房子

701
00:41:20,911 --> 00:41:22,378
所以一个小时后我就要走了

702
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:23,845
你想抢这栋房子吗？

703
00:41:25,249 --> 00:41:26,580
有点想呢

704
00:41:27,151 --> 00:41:28,641
再见(cheerio<英,口>分别时表达良好祝愿)，Colin

705
00:41:29,153 --> 00:41:31,314
你是怎么开车开到右边的？（英国开在左边）

706
00:41:32,256 --> 00:41:34,224
把Simon从名单上划掉

707
00:41:34,892 --> 00:41:36,189
怎么了？

708
00:41:36,293 --> 00:41:39,319
我的英国口音有点生疏了，半路上去掷飞镖

709
00:41:39,430 --> 00:41:41,330
说话说出Eliza Doolittle（80后英国歌手）的味道

710
00:41:43,868 --> 00:41:46,166
眼睛盯好了木板

711
00:41:47,471 --> 00:41:51,373
不是，要直射，再高点，好多了

712
00:41:53,777 --> 00:41:57,406
他妈的，我他妈就一傻逼！（继续模仿英音）

713
00:42:02,419 --> 00:42:05,081
你是说你被炒了

714
00:42:05,189 --> 00:42:08,955
是啊，丢了工作并不意味着世界末日

715
00:42:09,059 --> 00:42:11,357
我还有我的朋友和房子啊

716
00:42:11,462 --> 00:42:14,954
我要求不高，有间小屋（窈窕淑女插曲歌词，原文：All I want is a room somewhere, far away from the cold night air.我只要那里有间小屋，可以远离夜里的寒气。）

717
00:42:15,065 --> 00:42:19,434
可以远离夜里的寒气（窈窕淑女插曲歌词，原文：All I want is a room somewhere, far away from the cold night air.我只要那里有间小屋，可以远离夜里的寒气。）

718
00:42:22,239 --> 00:42:24,230
之后我试图跳出来

719
00:42:24,341 --> 00:42:27,469
由于某种原因，我惊慌失措，然后又满嘴波拉特口音

720
00:42:27,845 --> 00:42:31,508
接着下一轮？

721
00:42:33,484 --> 00:42:36,715
不了，我想我们该回家了

722
00:42:37,254 --> 00:42:41,918
哦，不！我说了半天，但还是一点都不了解你

723
00:42:45,229 --> 00:42:49,256
下一个，Svorgon？

724
00:42:54,204 --> 00:42:55,228
Svorgon？

725
00:42:55,339 --> 00:42:58,172
我跳到了《布偶大电影》里面的那个瑞典厨师

726
00:42:58,275 --> 00:42:59,401
他是我的最爱

727
00:42:59,510 --> 00:43:02,673
Ok，还有哪些人？

728
00:43:06,417 --> 00:43:07,941
我以为不准上这儿来

729
00:43:08,419 --> 00:43:09,613
你没带备忘录吗？

730
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:11,017
是我写的（带了，在脑子里）

731
00:43:11,388 --> 00:43:14,152
这儿变得越来越挤了，我和我的乐队都在这儿练习

732
00:43:14,258 --> 00:43:16,226
你乐队在哪儿演啊？

733
00:43:16,327 --> 00:43:18,659
在这儿，就目前而言

734
00:43:18,762 --> 00:43:21,595
我妈的朋友在找一个乐队，要做他儿子的受诫礼
（为满 13 岁的犹太男孩举行的成人仪式）

735
00:43:21,699 --> 00:43:24,497
谢了，我们不是那种乐队

736
00:43:24,602 --> 00:43:25,933
那种是赚钱的那种？

737
00:43:26,403 --> 00:43:27,961
我们不要再讨论这件事了

738
00:43:28,072 --> 00:43:30,040
我们还剩10个

739
00:43:30,507 --> 00:43:34,170
来自地中海俱乐部之特克斯和凯科斯群岛的Jay，我在努力，但我需要更多资料

740
00:43:34,278 --> 00:43:36,473
抱歉，现在是春假

741
00:43:36,580 --> 00:43:40,243
Jay可能不是他的真名，就像我不是那个带“I”的Kelli

742
00:43:40,918 --> 00:43:42,647
Barrett Ingold，住在迈阿密

743
00:43:42,753 --> 00:43:46,086
我知道在地理方面不是很理想，但他现在是个医生

744
00:43:46,190 --> 00:43:48,021
算逑，我讨厌迈阿密

745
00:43:48,125 --> 00:43:49,490
我觉得晒多了太阳会变笨

746
00:43:50,986 --> 00:43:52,783
Ok，那么Denver呢？

747
00:43:52,888 --> 00:43:56,449
我找到了一个山人，他有一节守车可以用来搬家了
（山人：特指十八世纪后期至十九世纪前期，美国西部一种白人冒险家及拓荒者。山人的特性是爱好和平、不为追求名誉或利益而探险，与原住民、白人、以及大自然和谐相处；守车，又称望车，是挂在货物列车尾部运转车长乘座的工作车。）

748
00:43:56,558 --> 00:43:59,254
过！他爱呼吸新鲜空气爱疯了！

749
00:43:59,361 --> 00:44:01,659
你知道和那种热爱户外的人去户外运动

750
00:44:01,763 --> 00:44:02,957
还要假装很享受有多累吗？

751
00:44:03,064 --> 00:44:04,998
比装英国人还累？

752
00:44:05,133 --> 00:44:07,795
至少我装英国人的时候，不需要用叶子来擦自己

753
00:44:07,903 --> 00:44:11,839
一针见血！那么Gerry Perry呢？他是个操纵木偶的人，所以他是单身

754
00:44:13,208 --> 00:44:15,142
我不要Gerry Perry

755
00:44:15,243 --> 00:44:16,938
Jake Adams在哪？

756
00:44:17,412 --> 00:44:20,074
- 在Noyaradougou（非洲马里共和国的一个小镇） - 什么？再他妈的什么地方？

757
00:44:20,549 --> 00:44:21,777
非洲

758
00:44:21,883 --> 00:44:23,851
他在经营他家的慈善基金会

759
00:44:23,952 --> 00:44:27,388
他在监督那里一所学校的建筑情况

760
00:44:30,492 --> 00:44:31,550
他会回来吗？

761
00:44:32,561 --> 00:44:35,587
他还是会回来的。但在此期间，有Gerry Perry！

762
00:44:35,697 --> 00:44:36,823
不……

763
00:44:38,767 --> 00:44:41,930
好了，木偶戏2点钟开始，明天公园见

764
00:44:42,037 --> 00:44:43,629
Ok

765
00:44:43,738 --> 00:44:45,865
- 嘿，Colin - 什么？

766
00:44:45,974 --> 00:44:48,841
那个……谢谢你的辛勤工作

767
00:44:48,944 --> 00:44:51,003
非常感谢

768
00:44:51,112 --> 00:44:52,238
是吗？

769
00:44:52,347 --> 00:44:54,406
就是有些时候，难以启齿……

770
00:44:55,083 --> 00:44:56,380
真的吗？

771
00:44:57,252 --> 00:44:58,310
哦……

772
00:45:06,528 --> 00:45:07,961
你在干什么？

773
00:45:08,096 --> 00:45:10,587
想让门砰的一声结束今晚

774
00:45:12,200 --> 00:45:15,533
你真是没女的陪你睡你活不下去了，是吧

775
00:45:16,738 --> 00:45:19,502
实际上，我可以，只是不好玩

776
00:45:23,945 --> 00:45:25,776
你不是我的菜

777
00:45:29,484 --> 00:45:32,112
你只用划掉你“pass”掉的人

778
00:45:32,220 --> 00:45:34,484
把我加进去不就得了

779
00:45:39,694 --> 00:45:41,252
谁的便便？

780
00:45:41,696 --> 00:45:43,129
你的便便！

781
00:45:43,231 --> 00:45:44,528
- 嘿 - 嗨

782
00:45:46,201 --> 00:45:48,294
- 这谁的孩子？ - 我侄子

783
00:45:48,770 --> 00:45:52,228
如果没有个孩子陪我看木偶戏，会很怪的

784
00:45:52,340 --> 00:45:53,568
非常好

785
00:45:53,675 --> 00:45:56,041
- 打个招呼嘛，Justin！- 啊！

786
00:45:56,144 --> 00:45:57,509
他是海盗

787
00:45:57,612 --> 00:45:59,739
你在说什么啊？

788
00:46:04,953 --> 00:46:07,183
- 好了，到你了 - Ok

789
00:46:07,956 --> 00:46:09,048
来吧

790
00:46:11,359 --> 00:46:14,487
- 谢谢Gerry. - 不用谢

791
00:46:26,808 --> 00:46:28,776
Daisy在家吗？

792
00:46:30,845 --> 00:46:32,073
没有

793
00:46:57,739 --> 00:47:00,207
你说他什么时候回家？

794
00:47:06,147 --> 00:47:07,808
- Gerry？- Ally？

795
00:47:07,949 --> 00:47:10,474
- 我的佛祖，你来这儿干嘛？ - 嗨

796
00:47:10,585 --> 00:47:14,316
我帮朋友照顾一下孩子

797
00:47:14,456 --> 00:47:16,754
那么，你看了魔术表演

798
00:47:16,858 --> 00:47:19,793
是啊，孩子喜欢嘛

799
00:47:19,894 --> 00:47:21,794
那是因为我说了很多“便便”

800
00:47:23,531 --> 00:47:24,555
那么？

801
00:47:26,634 --> 00:47:27,931
还记得他吗？

802
00:47:28,036 --> 00:47:29,663
嘿，Smart Alec（自作聪明的人）

803
00:47:29,771 --> 00:47:30,965
嗨

804
00:47:34,009 --> 00:47:36,307
你好吗？

805
00:47:36,444 --> 00:47:38,344
别女里女气的，问问她Daisy的情况

806
00:47:38,446 --> 00:47:40,880
别那么粗糙，伙计

807
00:47:41,416 --> 00:47:44,214
你真粗糙，抱歉了

808
00:47:44,786 --> 00:47:47,880
没事没事

809
00:47:47,989 --> 00:47:50,355
不错，你看起来不错

810
00:47:50,959 --> 00:47:53,052
没有Daisy不错

811
00:47:53,461 --> 00:47:54,826
无视他

812
00:47:56,798 --> 00:47:58,527
说真的

813
00:47:58,633 --> 00:48:01,397
也许我们该交换电话号码，然后叙叙旧

814
00:48:02,437 --> 00:48:04,632
你知道吗？我想我已经叙过旧了

815
00:48:04,939 --> 00:48:06,167
酷！

816
00:48:06,274 --> 00:48:08,742
不过偶遇到你，真是太好了

817
00:48:08,843 --> 00:48:10,276
偶遇到你，真是太好了

818
00:48:10,678 --> 00:48:12,976
- 才不好呢 - 大嘴巴！

819
00:48:13,748 --> 00:48:15,739
再见了

820
00:48:19,954 --> 00:48:22,286
- 嗨，Daisy. - 嘿

821
00:48:35,770 --> 00:48:37,135
Daisy……

822
00:48:43,344 --> 00:48:46,211
我真不敢相信我竟然和他睡过

823
00:48:46,314 --> 00:48:49,806
- Justin呢？ - 这就是啊

824
00:48:49,918 --> 00:48:51,385
这不是Justin

825
00:48:52,787 --> 00:48:53,845
你怎么了？

826
00:48:53,955 --> 00:48:55,684
你妈妈没教过你必要跟陌生人走吗？

827
00:48:55,790 --> 00:48:57,052
是你怎么了？

828
00:48:57,158 --> 00:48:59,353
你没发现你他妈就是一火星人啊？

829
00:48:59,461 --> 00:49:00,758
Justin！

830
00:49:01,129 --> 00:49:04,064
好了，你妈妈长什么样？

831
00:49:04,365 --> 00:49:05,389
想你

832
00:49:05,500 --> 00:49:07,730
Lucas！滚回老娘这儿来！

833
00:49:10,738 --> 00:49:11,932
等等！

834
00:49:13,942 --> 00:49:17,036
我像你妈吗？

835
00:49:17,912 --> 00:49:19,174
回答我！

836
00:49:19,814 --> 00:49:21,509
回答我啊，Lucas！

837
00:49:22,417 --> 00:49:23,907
Lucas！

838
00:49:27,255 --> 00:49:29,348
别玩消失啊，伙计

839
00:49:30,325 --> 00:49:34,762
我不会再买东西给你了，除非你找到Jake Adams

840
00:49:34,896 --> 00:49:36,761
他那么好的话，为什么当初没有继续好下去？

841
00:49:38,867 --> 00:49:41,358
我们做了一个协议：我们都会把处献给对方

842
00:49:41,469 --> 00:49:44,404
但是他大三出国，他走了以后

843
00:49:44,506 --> 00:49:46,064
我就撕毁了协议

844
00:49:46,174 --> 00:49:47,402
和谁？

845
00:49:47,509 --> 00:49:50,000
那20个里面还有谁比Jake Adams更好？

846
00:49:50,111 --> 00:49:51,874
为什么我们不去找他？

847
00:49:51,980 --> 00:49:53,777
你已经找到他了啊

848
00:49:53,882 --> 00:49:55,247
Gerry Perry？

849
00:49:55,350 --> 00:49:57,750
你把你的处献给了个耍木偶的！

850
00:49:59,020 --> 00:50:02,922
我知道，我对不起他

851
00:50:03,024 --> 00:50:06,551
哦，Ally，我低估你了，你真牛逼！

852
00:50:06,661 --> 00:50:09,824
这是关于你我最喜欢的事情！

853
00:50:11,032 --> 00:50:12,932
谢了！

854
00:50:14,969 --> 00:50:15,958
- 嘿 - 嗨

855
00:50:16,070 --> 00:50:19,164
- Eddie来了吗？ - 没有，是妈要来。别跑！

856
00:50:21,276 --> 00:50:23,141
我不能和妈吃饭，我还没洗头呢！

857
00:50:23,244 --> 00:50:24,802
你都让人看不出来了，看起来不错啊

858
00:50:25,113 --> 00:50:27,307
你还没有告诉老妈爸要来参加你的婚礼，是吗？

859
00:50:28,100 --> 00:50:29,692
- 是啊 - 这就是我在这儿的原因
860
00:50:29,934 --> 00:50:32,562
- 恩 - 我的头发很差劲吗？

861
00:50:32,670 --> 00:50:34,934
没有啦，我又不能让她一个人

862
00:50:35,840 --> 00:50:38,206
好吧，把黄油递过来！

863
00:50:38,843 --> 00:50:40,572
嗨，妈

864
00:50:41,946 --> 00:50:42,970
嗨，妈

865
00:50:43,081 --> 00:50:46,380
Kitty

866
00:50:46,484 --> 00:50:48,111
酒席承办人打电话给我了

867
00:50:48,853 --> 00:50:53,051
Rick不吃荤到什么程度啊？

868
00:50:53,157 --> 00:50:55,955
就一小点鸡肉可以吗？

869
00:50:56,261 --> 00:50:57,853
可以啦，Rick又不会来，他们掰了

870
00:50:57,962 --> 00:51:00,226
- Daisy！ - 什么？又分了！

871
00:51:00,632 --> 00:51:02,156
- 爸要来参加婚礼 - 什么？

872
00:51:02,267 --> 00:51:03,632
Ally！

873
00:51:05,403 --> 00:51:06,893
肿么能介样对我？

874
00:51:07,972 --> 00:51:10,600
我没怎么啊，妈

875
00:51:10,708 --> 00:51:14,041
除非让我去不了

876
00:51:14,145 --> 00:51:15,373
你不来我婚礼？

877
00:51:15,480 --> 00:51:19,075
你爸要来我就不来

878
00:51:19,217 --> 00:51:21,082
他可以当Allison的男伴嘛

879
00:51:21,819 --> 00:51:24,811
我保证你会度过一个美好的婚礼的！

880
00:51:25,323 --> 00:51:27,223
- 拜，妈 - 拜，妈

881
00:51:28,159 --> 00:51:31,026
- 自己去擦屁股！ - 我回来会跟她说的

882
00:51:31,129 --> 00:51:34,064
- 你去哪？ - 迈阿密，去做子宫颈抹片检查

883
00:51:34,165 --> 00:51:36,565
- 为什么？ - 你还记得Barrett Ingold吗？

884
00:51:36,668 --> 00:51:38,158
扔我们家洗碗机的那个？

885
00:51:38,269 --> 00:51:39,964
他现在是妇科医生

886
00:51:40,071 --> 00:51:41,436
但你讨厌迈阿密

887
00:51:41,539 --> 00:51:43,734
我知道，但在那儿我没有我希望的那么幸运

888
00:51:43,841 --> 00:51:46,309
我要用尽时间、金钱还有能孵化的蛋！

889
00:51:46,444 --> 00:51:49,140
那么，你是在告诉我，追踪你的前男友

890
00:51:49,247 --> 00:51:52,341
比帮我计划我的婚礼更重要啰？

891
00:51:52,450 --> 00:51:54,748
我知道你听起来很蠢，但真的很重要

892
00:51:54,852 --> 00:51:57,787
我觉得其他人都在阔步向前，只有我在原地踏步

893
00:51:57,922 --> 00:52:00,982
我在阔步向前，我真的在

894
00:52:01,092 --> 00:52:04,926
但我感觉你的这次追踪有点二

895
00:52:05,029 --> 00:52:07,862
你知道吗，如果你给你男朋友第二次机会

896
00:52:07,966 --> 00:52:09,593
你绝对不会结婚

897
00:52:09,701 --> 00:52:13,364
此外，我要做子宫颈抹片检查，然后他来做我的保险

898
00:52:13,471 --> 00:52:14,961
我来晚了！我的皮肤色素喷雾剂！

899
00:52:33,591 --> 00:52:35,081
Hello，Allison

900
00:52:37,028 --> 00:52:39,223
Barrett？

901
00:52:39,330 --> 00:52:42,356
我的佛祖啊，是你吗？

902
00:52:43,935 --> 00:52:45,266
嘿

903
00:52:46,237 --> 00:52:49,229
我是Ally！Ally Darling

904
00:52:49,340 --> 00:52:51,740
是SPINNING课程的Ally吗？

905
00:52:52,410 --> 00:52:53,536
不是

906
00:52:53,644 --> 00:52:55,168
是Greg生日Party的ally吗？

907
00:52:55,913 --> 00:52:58,040
我们一起上大学的！

908
00:53:00,018 --> 00:53:01,383
- 我们约会过！ - 哦！

909
00:53:03,154 --> 00:53:04,314
怎样？

910
00:53:04,422 --> 00:53:06,720
那是很久以前了！

911
00:53:06,824 --> 00:53:10,260
现在看看的的情况，挪一挪

912
00:53:11,195 --> 00:53:12,355
很好

913
00:53:21,572 --> 00:53:24,268
Ally，是你啊！

914
00:53:27,712 --> 00:53:30,476
他认出我的洞了！

915
00:53:30,615 --> 00:53:34,608
是怎么了？我是说，我被吓了一跳

916
00:53:34,719 --> 00:53:36,311
我很愿意为你诊断一下

917
00:53:36,421 --> 00:53:38,787
我跑那么远就为这个！

918
00:53:38,890 --> 00:53:40,983
把Barrett从名单中叉掉！

919
00:53:41,092 --> 00:53:43,117
全他妈叉了！

920
00:53:43,227 --> 00:53:44,387
我到底在干嘛？

921
00:53:44,495 --> 00:53:49,228
被炒，花剩下的十分钱去追踪那些白痴

922
00:53:49,333 --> 00:53:51,801
那些和我分过一次的白痴

923
00:53:51,903 --> 00:53:54,337
也许我该退出了

924
00:53:54,439 --> 00:53:57,465
那你悲剧了，因为我找到了Tom Piper

925
00:53:58,276 --> 00:53:59,641
继续

926
00:53:59,744 --> 00:54:01,143
他在特区，如你所说

927
00:54:01,279 --> 00:54:03,000
他现在是Mitchell参议员的助手

928
00:54:06,652 --> 00:54:08,914
我没有政治家的老婆合穿的衣服！

929
00:54:09,053 --> 00:54:10,111
哦！

930
00:54:10,221 --> 00:54:12,917
我有Ann Taylor的信贷！哈哈

931
00:54:14,092 --> 00:54:15,559
嗨

932
00:54:15,660 --> 00:54:17,321
我在你家门口，我想便便！

933
00:54:17,428 --> 00:54:20,591
自己进去，我10分钟后到

934
00:54:22,967 --> 00:54:24,400
嗨

935
00:54:26,070 --> 00:54:27,196
嘿

936
00:54:27,305 --> 00:54:28,567
我的王母娘娘啊！

937
00:54:28,673 --> 00:54:30,470
你不会是裸着坐在我妹旁边吧

938
00:54:31,776 --> 00:54:34,472
幸亏，他要穿着内裤弹吉他

939
00:54:34,579 --> 00:54:36,774
吉他会让他的那根凉快一些

940
00:54:36,881 --> 00:54:39,543
那么，你俩见过了

941
00:54:39,951 --> 00:54:42,283
你记得Tom Piper吗？

942
00:54:42,386 --> 00:54:45,378
Colin发现他在特区，明天我就要去那儿

943
00:54:46,457 --> 00:54:48,118
穿着这个！

944
00:54:48,226 --> 00:54:49,625
好兴奋耶~

945
00:54:49,727 --> 00:54:51,354
那你为什么要穿这种套装啊？

946
00:54:51,462 --> 00:54:53,692
你明天不是要去Sheffield和Bloom面试吗？

947
00:54:53,798 --> 00:54:55,663
这件套装很漂亮

948
00:54:55,800 --> 00:54:57,961
它既适用于爆无聊的面试

949
00:54:58,069 --> 00:55:01,835
也适用于意外的有目的的与未来老公的一次邂逅！
(Sorry guys, because of the period examination, I'm gonna stop here for a while. I'll be back 'til 7,Jan!)

950
00:55:01,939 --> 00:55:04,601
你想过卖掉那些畸形的雕刻吗？
(Sorry guys, because of the period examination, I'm gonna stop here for a while. I'll be back 'til 7,Jan!)

951
00:55:04,709 --> 00:55:07,940
- No, she needs a real job. - Oh, yeah, those are just a hobby.

952
00:55:08,045 --> 00:55:09,137
I think they're amazing.

953
00:55:09,247 --> 00:55:11,181
You should try. Not everyone can do that, you know.

954
00:55:12,483 --> 00:55:13,950
Excuse me, would you mind giving me and Ally

955
00:55:14,051 --> 00:55:15,018
a little bit of privacy, please?

956
00:55:16,669 --> 00:55:18,933
- She has to poo. - Ally!

957
00:55:20,005 --> 00:55:22,030
Hey, hasn't your lady friend left yet?

958
00:55:22,174 --> 00:55:24,574
No, I guess this one's a late sleeper.

959
00:55:24,677 --> 00:55:25,666
Wait. Are you...

960
00:55:25,778 --> 00:55:29,270
Is he hiding out here because there's a woman in his apartment?

961
00:55:29,381 --> 00:55:30,848
He is.

962
00:55:30,950 --> 00:55:33,350
That's it. I'm going to Anthony's Bakery. Excuse me.

963
00:55:33,452 --> 00:55:36,717
Do you want to grab me a cannoli? No?

964
00:55:37,923 --> 00:55:40,687
Okay. Keys.

965
00:55:54,840 --> 00:55:57,673
- Who the hell are you? - Andrea.

966
00:55:58,878 --> 00:56:01,278
He didn't tell you he was engaged?

967
00:56:01,380 --> 00:56:04,213
No. I am so sorry.

968
00:56:04,316 --> 00:56:07,513
When I told him I was engaged, he didn't say anything.

969
00:56:13,058 --> 00:56:14,923
Why?

970
00:56:15,027 --> 00:56:16,790
Tits!

971
00:56:16,996 --> 00:56:19,487
Oh. Oh.

972
00:56:20,633 --> 00:56:23,966
Oh. Why? Why?

973
00:56:33,612 --> 00:56:36,274
Hey, wouldn't it be easier

974
00:56:36,382 --> 00:56:38,543
if you just spent the night at their apartments

975
00:56:38,651 --> 00:56:41,017
and left in the morning, like a normal guy?

976
00:56:41,120 --> 00:56:42,849
No.

977
00:56:42,955 --> 00:56:44,388
I once stayed in a relationship with a girl

978
00:56:44,490 --> 00:56:46,890
because of a picture she had on her bedside table.

979
00:56:46,992 --> 00:56:50,450
It was her dressed as Cinderella on her fifth birthday.

980
00:56:52,164 --> 00:56:53,222
Grab that.

981
00:56:53,599 --> 00:56:54,896
So?

982
00:56:55,668 --> 00:56:57,732
So, every time I tried to split with her,

983
00:56:57,733 --> 00:56:59,833
I'd picture that little girl in the blue dress.

984
00:56:59,939 --> 00:57:03,602
Happy. Excited about Monty, her new gerbil,

985
00:57:03,709 --> 00:57:07,042
who she would later kill by accidentally putting him in the dryer.

986
00:57:12,918 --> 00:57:15,386
Just couldn't break that little girl's heart.

987
00:57:19,525 --> 00:57:22,323
So you're saying it's easier to sleep with girls and never call them again

988
00:57:22,428 --> 00:57:25,022
if you don't know anything about them?

989
00:57:26,932 --> 00:57:28,559
Kind of like a serial killer.

990
00:57:30,836 --> 00:57:32,428
Yeah, I guess so.

991
00:57:32,938 --> 00:57:34,030
Hmm.

992
00:57:34,873 --> 00:57:36,465
Hey, so I talked to Piper's assistant.

993
00:57:36,575 --> 00:57:39,567
He said he's gonna be doing research in the library of the Adams Building

994
00:57:39,678 --> 00:57:40,975
for the rest of the day.

995
00:57:41,080 --> 00:57:44,208
Oh, wait. Hold on. My leg fell asleep on the train.

996
00:57:44,316 --> 00:57:46,944
Pins and needles. Pins and needles.

997
00:57:47,052 --> 00:57:49,247
- Punch it. - Really?

998
00:57:51,557 --> 00:57:53,821
I'm punching.

999
00:57:53,926 --> 00:57:57,157
What? Your leg's never fallen asleep before?

1000
00:57:59,398 --> 00:58:00,422
What's that sound?

1001
00:58:01,166 --> 00:58:02,497
Nothing.

1002
00:58:02,601 --> 00:58:05,593
Hey, I didn't know you were such a big fan of Lionel Richie.

1003
00:58:05,704 --> 00:58:09,970
You know, looking at somebody's playlist is like reading their diary.

1004
00:58:15,814 --> 00:58:17,008
That's my bathtub.

1005
00:58:22,554 --> 00:58:23,612
Donald.

1006
00:58:24,023 --> 00:58:27,220
Ally... What are you doing here?

1007
00:58:28,927 --> 00:58:30,417
Visiting my fianc?

1008
00:58:31,897 --> 00:58:35,355
- Your fianc?who was at the North Pole? - Yep.

1009
00:58:35,467 --> 00:58:37,958
He's back. Pierre is back.

1010
00:58:38,170 --> 00:58:40,866
Wow. Pierre just happens to be in Washington, D.C.,

1011
00:58:40,973 --> 00:58:42,600
the same time that I have a conference?

1012
00:58:43,642 --> 00:58:46,577
Yep. He's meeting with the President.

1013
00:58:47,012 --> 00:58:49,572
- Oh. What a coincidence. - I know.

1014
00:58:49,682 --> 00:58:51,172
It's crazy, isn't it?

1015
00:58:52,051 --> 00:58:53,040
Yeah, it is.

1016
00:58:55,054 --> 00:58:58,455
That's exactly what it is. Okay.

1017
00:59:27,853 --> 00:59:29,081
Do you like freedom?

1018
00:59:29,188 --> 00:59:31,748
- Sign here for freedom. - Be on our mailing list for George Bush.

1019
00:59:31,890 --> 00:59:34,518
George W. Bush. Vote George Bush.

1020
00:59:34,660 --> 00:59:37,424
- Get on our mailing list. - Vote for freedom.

1021
00:59:59,855 --> 01:00:01,322
No, no, no. It's taken.

1022
01:00:01,923 --> 01:00:02,954
It's taken.

1023
01:00:12,132 --> 01:00:13,826
Okay, excuse me.

1024
01:00:15,600 --> 01:00:16,693
I'm just wondering...

1025
01:00:16,702 --> 01:00:19,964
if you could help me move the table about three feet... this way?

1026
01:00:21,139 --> 01:00:22,970
I just... I like it better over there.

1027
01:00:25,311 --> 01:00:27,141
Great, keep going just a little further.

1028
01:00:27,945 --> 01:00:32,438
Go, team. That's fantastic work. Thank you. Almost.

1029
01:00:33,916 --> 01:00:37,009
Almost. Almost there. Okay.

1030
01:00:37,185 --> 01:00:39,049
Okay, okay, okay. Okay.

1031
01:00:47,526 --> 01:00:49,120
Ally Darling.

1032
01:00:49,228 --> 01:00:50,627
Tom?

1033
01:00:50,830 --> 01:00:51,956
Shh!

1034
01:00:54,099 --> 01:00:56,795
Oh, my God! He's taking me to this party tonight.

1035
01:00:56,902 --> 01:00:58,096
I offered to stay at the Best Western,

1036
01:00:58,203 --> 01:01:00,568
but he insisted on putting me up at the Omni.

1037
01:01:00,671 --> 01:01:01,899
He dropped you off at the hotel...

1038
01:01:02,006 --> 01:01:04,565
and didn't come up for "it's good to see you" sex?

1039
01:01:04,674 --> 01:01:05,834
What'd you do to turn him off?

1040
01:01:05,942 --> 01:01:07,636
Nothing. He's a gentleman.

1041
01:01:07,743 --> 01:01:09,506
You wore that pantsuit, didn't you?

1042
01:01:09,611 --> 01:01:12,977
That pantsuit is sexy. It's very Katharine Hepburn.

1043
01:01:13,081 --> 01:01:14,639
All right. Let's clear something up right now.

1044
01:01:14,749 --> 01:01:17,046
Katharine Hepburn was not sexy. Audrey Hepburn was sexy.

1045
01:01:17,151 --> 01:01:18,310
Katharine Hepburn was a dude.

1046
01:01:19,752 --> 01:01:23,018
Well, Tom is just a good guy.

1047
01:01:23,123 --> 01:01:26,148
Besides, you wouldn't know a gentleman if he tiptoed up behind you

1048
01:01:26,258 --> 01:01:27,885
and tickled your balls.

1049
01:01:29,962 --> 01:01:31,553
Hello. Thank you.

1050
01:01:34,099 --> 01:01:35,929
I just got a present.

1051
01:01:36,868 --> 01:01:37,856
Oh!

1052
01:01:38,167 --> 01:01:42,660
He just sent over the most beautiful dress I've ever seen!

1053
01:01:43,505 --> 01:01:45,632
I feel like Cinderella.

1054
01:01:45,907 --> 01:01:49,467
Careful, if you're not home by midnight, it might turn into a pantsuit.

1055
01:01:58,285 --> 01:01:59,376
Wow!

1056
01:01:59,886 --> 01:02:01,114
Look at you.

1057
01:02:03,857 --> 01:02:06,882
You don't... You don't think it's a little small?

1058
01:02:08,393 --> 01:02:09,621
I'm sorry.

1059
01:02:09,727 --> 01:02:11,956
It was hard to tell what was going on underneath the pantsuit.

1060
01:02:14,631 --> 01:02:16,928
Perfect. You ready?

1061
01:02:17,733 --> 01:02:19,633
- Okay. - You all right?

1062
01:02:23,004 --> 01:02:24,301
Excuse me.

1063
01:02:26,575 --> 01:02:27,599
All right.

1064
01:02:27,710 --> 01:02:29,176
- Ready? All right. - Ready.

1065
01:02:30,779 --> 01:02:36,045
I feel lucky I feel free

1066
01:02:36,150 --> 01:02:40,677
I feel everything's a possibility

1067
01:02:46,123 --> 01:02:47,919
I can't believe Senator Phillips and his wife

1068
01:02:48,024 --> 01:02:50,390
- were talking to us for, like, 15 minutes. - I know!

1069
01:02:50,493 --> 01:02:52,358
He didn't even know my name before tonight.

1070
01:02:52,462 --> 01:02:55,294
Now he wants to hear my ideas about the tobacco reform bill.

1071
01:02:55,397 --> 01:02:59,356
And she wants to take me out to lunch. Some place with popovers!

1072
01:03:00,969 --> 01:03:02,697
We make a great team.

1073
01:03:02,804 --> 01:03:04,863
With you by my side, we could own this town.

1074
01:03:04,972 --> 01:03:06,769
We could totally own it.

1075
01:03:07,175 --> 01:03:08,733
I mean it, Ally.

1076
01:03:12,979 --> 01:03:16,879
Look, I have my eyes on a Senate seat, and then the presidency.

1077
01:03:16,981 --> 01:03:18,812
Now, if tonight is any indication,

1078
01:03:18,916 --> 01:03:20,908
I think together we could go all the way.

1079
01:03:21,018 --> 01:03:23,179
- Let's do it! - So, we're doing it?

1080
01:03:23,287 --> 01:03:24,754
Yeah!

1081
01:03:25,421 --> 01:03:27,253
What are we doing?

1082
01:03:27,690 --> 01:03:29,419
We're getting married!

1083
01:03:30,826 --> 01:03:32,796
- Oh. - Yeah!

1084
01:03:32,896 --> 01:03:34,453
Well,

1085
01:03:34,564 --> 01:03:37,726
maybe we should kiss first and see how that goes.

1086
01:03:38,133 --> 01:03:41,159
A kiss? No.

1087
01:03:41,269 --> 01:03:44,294
I want you to be my beard. I'm gay.

1088
01:03:47,007 --> 01:03:48,030
What?

1089
01:03:48,140 --> 01:03:50,268
Gay. Like super gay.

1090
01:03:50,375 --> 01:03:53,775
Like, one down here, one here, one here, one here, gay.

1091
01:03:55,246 --> 01:03:56,612
I thought you knew that.

1092
01:03:57,515 --> 01:03:59,744
America's ready for a black President.

1093
01:03:59,851 --> 01:04:02,409
They're not ready for a gay black President.

1094
01:04:02,918 --> 01:04:05,683
And we have history, Ally.

1095
01:04:05,789 --> 01:04:09,189
I mean, I wouldn't have known I was gay if I hadn't dated you.

1096
01:04:10,826 --> 01:04:13,420
So, what do you say?

1097
01:04:13,529 --> 01:04:15,359
Can I get back to you?

1098
01:04:35,178 --> 01:04:36,738
Hey, Bandit.

1099
01:04:41,152 --> 01:04:43,142
Wait, wait, wait. Don't move. Stay right there.

1100
01:04:44,721 --> 01:04:46,120
What are you doing here?

1101
01:04:46,222 --> 01:04:47,916
I'm not depressed enough to sleep with you.

1102
01:04:48,023 --> 01:04:49,490
Close your eyes.

1103
01:04:49,591 --> 01:04:52,082
- That won't help. - And

1104
01:04:52,593 --> 01:04:53,992
open them.

1105
01:04:59,198 --> 01:05:00,825
What do you think?

1106
01:05:09,008 --> 01:05:10,032
My wiring's a little spotty.

1107
01:05:10,142 --> 01:05:12,575
Every time these go on, your bathroom light burns out,

1108
01:05:12,677 --> 01:05:14,645
but I think it's worth it.

1109
01:05:18,116 --> 01:05:19,411
What did you do?

1110
01:05:19,516 --> 01:05:21,642
I think it really brings out the detail, you know?

1111
01:05:21,751 --> 01:05:23,980
I never noticed Louie's gold tooth before.

1112
01:05:24,085 --> 01:05:26,280
I named him Louie, by the way.

1113
01:05:27,888 --> 01:05:29,583
I can't believe it.

1114
01:05:30,323 --> 01:05:32,120
This is amazing.

1115
01:05:32,257 --> 01:05:35,590
Yeah. Well, you sounded depressed on the phone, so...

1116
01:05:36,162 --> 01:05:37,629
You hungry?

1117
01:05:39,131 --> 01:05:40,188
I'm starving!

1118
01:05:42,569 --> 01:05:45,331
So, I got good news. I found Julie from college.

1119
01:05:45,436 --> 01:05:47,734
She is a man now, and she's single.

1120
01:05:48,806 --> 01:05:50,865
She's cute. Looks like Ralph Macchio.

1121
01:05:52,643 --> 01:05:53,631
You know what?

1122
01:05:53,778 --> 01:05:56,041
Even if he were straight, it wouldn't have worked anyway.

1123
01:05:56,145 --> 01:05:59,841
You got to be a lady to be the First Lady, and I ain't no lady.

1124
01:05:59,948 --> 01:06:02,382
You're a lady. You're lots of lady.

1125
01:06:02,950 --> 01:06:07,046
You're once, twice, 20 times a lady.

1126
01:06:13,392 --> 01:06:15,088
Okay. Okay.

1127
01:06:15,195 --> 01:06:17,355
You're once, twice

1128
01:06:17,463 --> 01:06:20,022
Three times a lady

1129
01:06:21,499 --> 01:06:23,592
I love you

1130
01:06:25,936 --> 01:06:29,463
Yeah, you're once, twice

1131
01:06:30,306 --> 01:06:32,034
Three times a lady

1132
01:06:34,309 --> 01:06:37,333
I love you

1133
01:06:40,747 --> 01:06:42,237
Thank you. Thank you.

1134
01:06:42,349 --> 01:06:43,441
Whoa.

1135
01:06:47,888 --> 01:06:49,752
Oh, shit.

1136
01:06:49,856 --> 01:06:53,052
I either need to lie down or throw up.

1137
01:06:53,158 --> 01:06:54,386
You okay?

1138
01:06:54,493 --> 01:06:56,654
Yeah. No.

1139
01:06:57,929 --> 01:06:59,590
I have to go to my sister's wedding alone.

1140
01:07:00,898 --> 01:07:02,228
I'll go with you.

1141
01:07:02,766 --> 01:07:06,132
- You'd do that? - Yeah. Why not?

1142
01:07:08,236 --> 01:07:11,729
Thanks. I really appreciate that.

1143
01:07:15,076 --> 01:07:17,508
I still think I'm gonna throw up.

1144
01:07:19,114 --> 01:07:20,172
Let's get some air.

1145
01:07:30,390 --> 01:07:31,981
What are we doing?

1146
01:07:32,090 --> 01:07:35,581
Just because it's dark doesn't mean you have to whisper.

1147
01:07:39,929 --> 01:07:41,987
- Are we in the Garden? - Yep.

1148
01:07:43,332 --> 01:07:45,163
This has got to be illegal.

1149
01:07:45,267 --> 01:07:47,633
Yeah, probably. I worked here one summer.

1150
01:07:47,736 --> 01:07:51,763
I passed out programs and I managed to swipe a passkey before I got fired.

1151
01:07:51,874 --> 01:07:52,863
You got fired?

1152
01:07:52,975 --> 01:07:56,636
Yeah. There was an incident with the mascot.

1153
01:07:56,743 --> 01:07:57,971
What happened?

1154
01:07:58,412 --> 01:08:01,643
I may or may not have pissed in his pot of gold.

1155
01:08:01,748 --> 01:08:04,307
- Ever played H.O.R.S.E. In the Garden? - No.

1156
01:08:06,718 --> 01:08:08,310
But I have played H.O.R.S.E.

1157
01:08:08,419 --> 01:08:10,148
Okay, okay.

1158
01:08:12,022 --> 01:08:13,010
Okay.

1159
01:08:15,458 --> 01:08:17,289
Oh! No!

1160
01:08:18,226 --> 01:08:22,322
"H" for you, my friend. What are you doing?

1161
01:08:22,431 --> 01:08:25,196
We're playing strip H.O.R.S.E. Is there another kind?

1162
01:08:26,435 --> 01:08:28,266
There's the kind where you keep your clothes on.

1163
01:08:28,370 --> 01:08:32,396
What's fun about that? All right. "H".

1164
01:08:33,908 --> 01:08:35,273
Backboard.

1165
01:08:37,743 --> 01:08:38,971
Uh-huh.

1166
01:08:39,411 --> 01:08:40,844
Okay. Okay.

1167
01:08:47,751 --> 01:08:49,549
Oh, my God!

1168
01:09:00,628 --> 01:09:01,686
Nope.

1169
01:09:06,601 --> 01:09:07,795
Yeah!

1170
01:09:08,168 --> 01:09:09,829
Panty time!

1171
01:09:12,472 --> 01:09:14,406
Come on!

1172
01:09:25,116 --> 01:09:27,140
That was close. That's an "H".

1173
01:09:30,388 --> 01:09:32,582
This is not fair.

1174
01:09:33,021 --> 01:09:36,387
I miss one shot, and I'm almost totally naked.

1175
01:09:37,159 --> 01:09:38,252
Well, that's the game.

1176
01:09:38,827 --> 01:09:41,625
Well, the game is changing.

1177
01:09:41,729 --> 01:09:43,356
It's now one-on-one.

1178
01:09:50,169 --> 01:09:51,692
This way. Let's go, baby.

1179
01:09:53,938 --> 01:09:55,269
Come get it.

1180
01:09:55,373 --> 01:09:57,272
Okay. Let's go.

1181
01:10:00,944 --> 01:10:02,606
Here we go, here we go Satellite radio

1182
01:10:02,714 --> 01:10:04,613
Y'all getting hit with boom boom

1183
01:10:04,715 --> 01:10:06,410
Beats so big I'm stepping on leprechauns

1184
01:10:06,517 --> 01:10:08,177
Shittin' on y'all with the boom boom

1185
01:10:08,284 --> 01:10:09,911
Shittin' on y'all with the boom boom

1186
01:10:10,253 --> 01:10:11,880
Shittin' on y'all with the...

1187
01:10:28,834 --> 01:10:29,925
Oh, my God.

1188
01:10:30,369 --> 01:10:31,629
I can't believe it.

1189
01:10:31,735 --> 01:10:34,135
I think that dress is gonna look good on him.

1190
01:10:34,239 --> 01:10:37,207
It's a good thing you play the guitar, because you suck at basketball.

1191
01:10:38,409 --> 01:10:41,241
Well, you can't be good at everything. It just wouldn't be fair.

1192
01:10:41,343 --> 01:10:44,211
And I can't believe that you can play Lionel Richie!

1193
01:10:44,314 --> 01:10:45,678
I can play a lot of things.

1194
01:10:45,781 --> 01:10:48,977
So, how come you don't make a living at it? You're really good.

1195
01:10:49,184 --> 01:10:52,277
Ah, I want to play my own music.

1196
01:10:52,386 --> 01:10:54,444
Don't you worry about paying the rent?

1197
01:10:54,555 --> 01:10:56,352
I don't love marketing, but...

1198
01:10:56,456 --> 01:10:58,048
What do you love?

1199
01:11:02,327 --> 01:11:04,522
I love making those freaky little sculptures,

1200
01:11:04,996 --> 01:11:06,462
but I'm not gonna make any money at that.

1201
01:11:06,564 --> 01:11:08,965
How do you know? You've never tried.

1202
01:11:09,801 --> 01:11:13,600
I've never jumped into the harbor, either.

1203
01:11:13,704 --> 01:11:15,968
Doesn't mean that it's a good idea.

1204
01:11:16,073 --> 01:11:17,335
I think it's a great idea.

1205
01:11:17,441 --> 01:11:21,240
I think it's the best idea you've ever had.

1206
01:11:22,778 --> 01:11:24,507
- No. - Yes.

1207
01:11:24,613 --> 01:11:26,011
- No. - Yes!

1208
01:11:26,113 --> 01:11:27,705
- No. - Yes!

1209
01:11:27,815 --> 01:11:29,441
We are gonna jump in the harbor!

1210
01:11:29,549 --> 01:11:31,016
- No. No. No. No. - Let's go.

1211
01:11:31,117 --> 01:11:33,051
God! No!

1212
01:11:33,153 --> 01:11:34,347
Let's do it!

1213
01:11:55,104 --> 01:11:57,038
Holy fuck, this is fucking cold!

1214
01:11:57,172 --> 01:11:59,140
This is the worst idea you've ever had!

1215
01:12:12,286 --> 01:12:15,311
I can't believe you finally got me naked.

1216
01:12:15,421 --> 01:12:17,081
Well, my shirt does look good on you.

1217
01:12:17,189 --> 01:12:18,850
Good, 'cause I'm keeping it.

1218
01:12:19,157 --> 01:12:21,751
No, you're not. I can't afford to lose anymore shirts.

1219
01:12:21,860 --> 01:12:23,850
Women are always stealing my shirts.

1220
01:12:23,961 --> 01:12:25,826
Women aren't always stealing your shirts.

1221
01:12:25,930 --> 01:12:30,559
They're borrowing them, fully intending to give them back, but you never call.

1222
01:12:30,667 --> 01:12:32,531
So, you're saying that if I have fewer one-night stands,

1223
01:12:32,635 --> 01:12:34,465
I'll have more shirts?

1224
01:12:34,802 --> 01:12:36,133
I think so.

1225
01:12:40,542 --> 01:12:41,871
Well, then, that settles it.

1226
01:12:43,476 --> 01:12:45,343
I'm changing my ways,

1227
01:12:45,446 --> 01:12:48,140
and I'm not gonna lose anymore shirts.

1228
01:12:50,083 --> 01:12:51,242
Really?

1229
01:12:51,350 --> 01:12:52,681
Really.

1230
01:12:54,653 --> 01:12:58,714
In fact, I think I'm gonna take this one back right now.

1231
01:12:58,823 --> 01:13:00,380
Good for you.

1232
01:13:25,011 --> 01:13:26,979
- Wait. - It's okay, I have one.

1233
01:13:27,313 --> 01:13:28,610
No.

1234
01:13:29,682 --> 01:13:31,411
I have to slow down.

1235
01:13:33,717 --> 01:13:36,584
Okay. Okay, that's fine.

1236
01:13:40,656 --> 01:13:44,524
What if I just put it in a little bit? It won't even count.

1237
01:13:44,626 --> 01:13:46,457
Eileen says it counts.

1238
01:13:49,632 --> 01:13:50,929
What about, like, that much?

1239
01:13:51,032 --> 01:13:52,397
That's nothing.

1240
01:13:52,500 --> 01:13:54,364
You won't even feel it.

1241
01:13:56,737 --> 01:13:59,535
Okay. I understand. That's fine.

1242
01:14:01,174 --> 01:14:03,472
But I am gonna keep kissing you.

1243
01:14:36,150 --> 01:14:37,116
Hi.

1244
01:14:37,216 --> 01:14:38,183
Hi.

1245
01:14:38,984 --> 01:14:41,680
You look so beautiful in the morning.

1246
01:14:42,587 --> 01:14:44,486
- I do? - Yeah.

1247
01:14:52,662 --> 01:14:54,322
How's this for a slice of awesome?

1248
01:14:54,430 --> 01:14:57,923
Mexican wrestling on pay-per-view all day.

1249
01:14:58,034 --> 01:15:01,695
I will run to the store and get eggs and salsa for huevos rancheros,

1250
01:15:01,837 --> 01:15:05,500
you stay here and whip up margaritas. Sound good?

1251
01:15:06,709 --> 01:15:09,403
Shit! I can't! Oh, my God!

1252
01:15:11,211 --> 01:15:12,269
Cereal?

1253
01:15:12,378 --> 01:15:14,437
No! I'm meeting Daisy.

1254
01:15:14,546 --> 01:15:18,380
I'm already late. She hates it when I'm late. Oh, no.

1255
01:15:40,836 --> 01:15:41,824
Whoo!

1256
01:15:41,936 --> 01:15:45,393
I can't believe Eddie didn't want to pick out these place cards.

1257
01:15:45,672 --> 01:15:48,038
Oh, no, no, no. He has terrible taste in fonts.

1258
01:15:48,173 --> 01:15:49,868
Have you convinced Mom to come to the wedding yet?

1259
01:15:50,075 --> 01:15:51,064
No, and I don't have to,

1260
01:15:51,176 --> 01:15:53,666
because you are gonna talk Dad out of coming.

1261
01:15:53,778 --> 01:15:55,542
- I am? - Let's face it.

1262
01:15:55,647 --> 01:15:57,705
Dad's only coming because he thinks that he has to.

1263
01:15:57,815 --> 01:16:00,842
So, why not just let him off the hook and make everybody happy?

1264
01:16:00,986 --> 01:16:02,680
It's not a bad idea.

1265
01:16:02,787 --> 01:16:05,914
Oh, great! You guys can cast the final vote, we've narrowed it down.

1266
01:16:06,023 --> 01:16:09,652
To this one, or this nearly identical one.

1267
01:16:09,760 --> 01:16:11,124
Monotype Corsiva.

1268
01:16:11,227 --> 01:16:13,058
- How do you know that? - I'm married.

1269
01:16:13,228 --> 01:16:16,197
Okay, are we done? Because we want to hear about D.C.

1270
01:16:16,430 --> 01:16:17,988
Did you go to the Holocaust Museum?

1271
01:16:18,098 --> 01:16:20,032
No, but that would have been more fun.

1272
01:16:20,134 --> 01:16:22,101
So, there were no sparks with Tom?

1273
01:16:22,201 --> 01:16:25,637
Tom? What happened to Jake? I thought you were looking for Jake.

1274
01:16:25,738 --> 01:16:28,672
Jake's in Africa and Tom's gay, but it's okay,

1275
01:16:28,774 --> 01:16:31,640
because Colin is gonna be my date for the wedding.

1276
01:16:31,742 --> 01:16:33,678
Is that the guy who answered your cell phone

1277
01:16:33,779 --> 01:16:36,646
and got mad at me for waking him up at 2:00 in the afternoon?

1278
01:16:36,748 --> 01:16:38,681
Yeah. I took his phone by mistake.

1279
01:16:38,783 --> 01:16:40,910
You invited Colin? Your rapey neighbor?

1280
01:16:41,053 --> 01:16:42,484
Do we call him that?

1281
01:16:42,585 --> 01:16:43,984
Just behind your back.

1282
01:16:45,188 --> 01:16:49,214
Okay. Well, let's stop because he's actually a pretty good guy.

1283
01:16:49,324 --> 01:16:50,449
Oh, Ally.

1284
01:16:50,893 --> 01:16:53,156
- What? - You slept with him!

1285
01:16:53,293 --> 01:16:54,624
Oh, no!

1286
01:16:54,728 --> 01:16:57,219
I did not. I didn't.

1287
01:16:57,331 --> 01:16:58,354
Good. Don't.

1288
01:16:58,764 --> 01:17:00,459
Because he's not the kind of guy you end up with.

1289
01:17:00,567 --> 01:17:02,999
He's the kind of guy you date before the guy you end up with.

1290
01:17:03,101 --> 01:17:04,832
How do you know? You haven't even met him.

1291
01:17:04,971 --> 01:17:06,961
I don't have to meet him. I've had sex with him.

1292
01:17:07,074 --> 01:17:09,734
Except his name is Doug, and he's a fucking liar!

1293
01:17:09,874 --> 01:17:13,366
Well, I have met him, and he is dangerously sexy.

1294
01:17:13,478 --> 01:17:16,708
And if he wanted to come in through the back door, you'd let him.

1295
01:17:17,181 --> 01:17:18,614
Don't let him, Ally.

1296
01:17:18,715 --> 01:17:20,614
You guys don't need to worry.

1297
01:17:20,716 --> 01:17:22,615
I'm not going to let him in any door.

1298
01:17:22,717 --> 01:17:25,515
He's just a friend who's doing me a favor.

1299
01:17:52,610 --> 01:17:54,634
Honey, I'm home.

1300
01:17:56,479 --> 01:18:00,470
So, I TiVo-ed Mexican wrestling for you and I cooked.

1301
01:18:00,581 --> 01:18:03,608
They're supposed to be taquitos, they look like cannolis,

1302
01:18:03,717 --> 01:18:06,981
but they kind of taste like egg rolls.

1303
01:18:07,086 --> 01:18:09,577
What are you doing? Are you working on the diner? All right.

1304
01:18:10,959 --> 01:18:12,721
Don't let me bug you.

1305
01:18:19,165 --> 01:18:23,897
Hey, so, just out of curiosity, did you ever hear anything from Jake?

1306
01:18:25,303 --> 01:18:26,326
Nope.

1307
01:18:29,005 --> 01:18:31,838
Really? Not a phone call? Nothing?

1308
01:18:32,574 --> 01:18:33,905
Nope.

1309
01:18:36,745 --> 01:18:38,609
Okay, well,

1310
01:18:38,713 --> 01:18:42,582
I'm kind of busy right now, so I guess I'll just see you later.

1311
01:18:43,652 --> 01:18:45,414
Shit! Ally, wait.

1312
01:18:45,620 --> 01:18:46,814
- Wait, wait. - Just go.

1313
01:18:46,921 --> 01:18:48,081
I don't want to hear anymore lies.

1314
01:18:48,221 --> 01:18:49,848
All right, yes. Jake is back in town

1315
01:18:49,956 --> 01:18:52,481
and I do have his number, but I didn't think that mattered now.

1316
01:18:52,591 --> 01:18:53,922
Would you please just go?

1317
01:18:54,026 --> 01:18:55,459
What about last night?

1318
01:18:55,561 --> 01:18:57,960
I think we should just forget about last night.

1319
01:18:58,062 --> 01:18:59,962
- Because of Jake? - No.

1320
01:19:01,732 --> 01:19:05,598
Because you're not the kind of guy I'm supposed to end up with.

1321
01:19:07,136 --> 01:19:08,864
What kind of guy am I, Ally?

1322
01:19:11,773 --> 01:19:14,332
You're the kind of guy you date before you meet the guy you end up with,

1323
01:19:14,441 --> 01:19:16,240
and I've already dated 20 of you.

1324
01:19:21,781 --> 01:19:23,340
So, you're gonna try and make it work with Jake,

1325
01:19:23,450 --> 01:19:26,816
a guy you haven't seen in years, just so you don't go over the number 20?

1326
01:19:26,954 --> 01:19:28,784
It's not just about a number anymore, okay?

1327
01:19:28,888 --> 01:19:30,980
- Well, then what is it? - It's what I want!

1328
01:19:31,089 --> 01:19:32,283
You don't know what you want, Ally.

1329
01:19:32,823 --> 01:19:34,983
You're so busy trying to be what everyone else wants you to be,

1330
01:19:35,092 --> 01:19:36,183
you don't know who you are.

1331
01:19:36,293 --> 01:19:38,693
At least I have relationships.

1332
01:19:38,828 --> 01:19:42,422
You can't even hang out with a woman for 24 hours without sleeping with her.

1333
01:19:42,531 --> 01:19:44,725
That was true until I met you.

1334
01:19:48,037 --> 01:19:52,405
Well, I'm sure that if we had slept together, you'd be long gone by now,

1335
01:19:52,507 --> 01:19:56,603
because that's who you are, Colin, and that's who you'll always be.

1336
01:19:59,246 --> 01:20:02,681
All right. Whatever you say, Ally. You obviously have it all figured out.

1337
01:20:05,817 --> 01:20:07,682
And I do know who I am!

1338
01:20:07,786 --> 01:20:12,017
I'm someone who's not gonna let another undeserving asshole into my heart!

1339
01:20:12,122 --> 01:20:13,884
Or my vagina!

1340
01:20:13,990 --> 01:20:15,582
Shut the fuck up!

1341
01:20:15,726 --> 01:20:16,714
Stop fucking your dog!

1342
01:20:43,578 --> 01:20:46,809
Hi, Jake Adams, it's Ally.

1343
01:20:47,215 --> 01:20:51,047
Ally Darling from high school. Go, Vikings.

1344
01:20:51,618 --> 01:20:52,745
Um...

1345
01:20:53,221 --> 01:20:54,687
I came across your number,

1346
01:20:54,823 --> 01:20:59,349
and I thought, "Wow, I should really call Jake

1347
01:20:59,458 --> 01:21:04,157
"and leave him a long, rambling message on his voice mail".

1348
01:21:06,264 --> 01:21:11,996
Anyway, if you're feeling up to it, you can give me a call anytime.

1349
01:21:12,102 --> 01:21:14,592
My number is 617-55...

1350
01:21:15,837 --> 01:21:19,501
Oh, my God, I just hiccupped. I'm sorry.

1351
01:21:20,374 --> 01:21:21,636
617-55...

1352
01:21:23,343 --> 01:21:25,370
All right. Okay...

1353
01:21:25,480 --> 01:21:28,040
My number is 617-555-0192. Okay, bye.

1354
01:21:33,420 --> 01:21:36,513
Well, who doesn't call that girl back?

1355
01:21:43,327 --> 01:21:44,351
Not again.

1356
01:21:44,828 --> 01:21:46,317
Who's the surprise guest this time?

1357
01:21:46,429 --> 01:21:47,589
I was supposed to have lunch with Dad

1358
01:21:47,697 --> 01:21:49,221
to tell him that he didn't have to come to the wedding,

1359
01:21:49,332 --> 01:21:50,856
but then he said he was gonna bring his girlfriend.

1360
01:21:50,967 --> 01:21:51,956
- Jacinda? - Yeah.

1361
01:21:52,068 --> 01:21:54,262
And I just couldn't have that conversation with him in front of her.

1362
01:21:54,369 --> 01:21:56,667
So, I just thought, you know, we could do it together.

1363
01:21:56,771 --> 01:22:00,400
I am never meeting you for another meal ever again.

1364
01:22:01,242 --> 01:22:02,903
You don't mean that.

1365
01:22:03,611 --> 01:22:06,045
Ally, I didn't know you were coming. What a nice surprise.

1366
01:22:06,147 --> 01:22:07,307
- Hi. - I'm Daisy.

1367
01:22:07,414 --> 01:22:10,382
Got all my girls here. I see that you've got one of these, too.

1368
01:22:10,483 --> 01:22:12,780
I got a couple for the two of us, so we can text and tweet.

1369
01:22:13,052 --> 01:22:15,985
You should follow me on Twitter, "VeryTerry3".

1370
01:22:16,354 --> 01:22:18,322
Or we could just talk right now.

1371
01:22:18,422 --> 01:22:19,854
LOL.

1372
01:22:21,158 --> 01:22:24,650
He is so excited about your wedding. It's all he can text about.

1373
01:22:24,761 --> 01:22:27,319
I can't wait for everyone to meet my lady.

1374
01:22:28,663 --> 01:22:30,758
Oh, you're coming to the wedding, too?

1375
01:22:30,867 --> 01:22:33,800
That's great. That's so great.

1376
01:22:33,902 --> 01:22:37,338
- Ally, isn't that so great? - It's great. It's so great.

1377
01:22:37,939 --> 01:22:38,964
Oh!

1378
01:22:41,508 --> 01:22:42,736
Excuse me for a second.

1379
01:22:43,543 --> 01:22:46,034
- Don't go. - We are just fine.

1380
01:22:49,281 --> 01:22:51,248
Hold up. Ashton is getting his car washed.

1381
01:22:51,615 --> 01:22:53,048
- Nuh-uh. - Lookit.

1382
01:22:57,987 --> 01:23:00,217
I am a human rocket

1383
01:23:00,323 --> 01:23:02,758
On a mission of deployment

1384
01:23:02,860 --> 01:23:04,885
I've been cocked and loaded

1385
01:23:04,995 --> 01:23:07,053
Ready for the culmination

1386
01:23:07,163 --> 01:23:09,392
I am a human missile

1387
01:23:09,497 --> 01:23:11,363
Guided by a secret agenda

1388
01:23:11,467 --> 01:23:14,059
That commands my every thoughts and deeds

1389
01:23:14,168 --> 01:23:16,260
And wills me on my way

1390
01:23:20,739 --> 01:23:22,969
I am a human rocket

1391
01:23:23,075 --> 01:23:25,508
On a mission of redemption

1392
01:23:25,610 --> 01:23:27,271
I've been cocked and loaded

1393
01:23:27,378 --> 01:23:29,812
Primed by everything I know

1394
01:23:29,914 --> 01:23:32,143
I am a human missile

1395
01:23:32,249 --> 01:23:34,113
Guided by a secret voice

1396
01:23:34,218 --> 01:23:36,652
That commands my every thoughts and deeds

1397
01:23:36,753 --> 01:23:39,381
And wills me on my righteous way

1398
01:24:39,103 --> 01:24:40,299
All right. Great.

1399
01:24:41,840 --> 01:24:43,000
Ally.

1400
01:24:43,775 --> 01:24:44,764
Jake.

1401
01:24:46,010 --> 01:24:48,740
My brothers actually went more into the business side of things,

1402
01:24:48,846 --> 01:24:52,042
and when my dad asked me to run the foundation,

1403
01:24:52,148 --> 01:24:54,877
it was sort of more of a natural fit for me, you know?

1404
01:24:54,983 --> 01:24:57,679
I've always been better at giving away money versus making it.

1405
01:24:57,786 --> 01:24:59,810
I'm rambling. I can hear myself totally rambling.

1406
01:24:59,920 --> 01:25:01,080
- No. No, no, not at all. - I am. I am.

1407
01:25:01,187 --> 01:25:03,815
- I've been doing it all day. - Kind of, but it's interesting.

1408
01:25:03,923 --> 01:25:05,391
Hey, what do... I mean, what about you?

1409
01:25:05,493 --> 01:25:07,551
Last I heard you were in marketing, right?

1410
01:25:07,661 --> 01:25:11,493
Yeah. I'm actually in between jobs right now.

1411
01:25:11,629 --> 01:25:12,689
Well, listen, say the word.

1412
01:25:12,799 --> 01:25:14,959
I mean, I can get you an interview over at Adams in two seconds.

1413
01:25:15,068 --> 01:25:16,499
Oh, thank you.

1414
01:25:16,601 --> 01:25:19,035
But you know what? I'm actually... I'm thinking about making a change.

1415
01:25:19,137 --> 01:25:21,799
A change? Oh, yeah? What would you do?

1416
01:25:23,040 --> 01:25:25,941
I make these clay sculptures.

1417
01:25:26,043 --> 01:25:28,943
They're sort of these freaky little urban scenes.

1418
01:25:29,511 --> 01:25:32,446
They're kind of hard to explain. I'd really have to show you.

1419
01:25:32,947 --> 01:25:34,413
I'd love to see them.

1420
01:25:35,882 --> 01:25:37,475
Really?

1421
01:25:37,584 --> 01:25:39,449
They're in my shower.

1422
01:25:40,853 --> 01:25:42,615
Then I guess we're done here.

1423
01:25:48,695 --> 01:25:50,787
See. This is where they dry.

1424
01:25:50,930 --> 01:25:52,794
Wow. They really are in your shower.

1425
01:25:52,898 --> 01:25:54,264
Yep.

1426
01:26:12,280 --> 01:26:14,213
Did I tell you that he speaks four different languages,

1427
01:26:14,581 --> 01:26:16,070
but he's so not obnoxious about it?

1428
01:26:16,182 --> 01:26:20,381
And he's still so goddamn handsome, and he smells so fucking good.

1429
01:26:20,487 --> 01:26:21,578
It's crazy.

1430
01:26:21,687 --> 01:26:24,656
He's taking me to a gala at the Institute of Contemporary Art,

1431
01:26:24,756 --> 01:26:26,623
and then I think we're going to go...

1432
01:26:26,727 --> 01:26:29,421
Whoa. That's not your dress.

1433
01:26:29,527 --> 01:26:32,359
Yeah. Yeah, I know, I just...

1434
01:26:32,463 --> 01:26:34,897
Yeah, I just like this one better, 'cause there's just...

1435
01:26:34,998 --> 01:26:37,726
You know, it's more comfortable. There's just more room to...

1436
01:26:37,833 --> 01:26:41,963
To eat and to move, and to... To dance.

1437
01:26:42,070 --> 01:26:43,264
Okay.

1438
01:26:43,372 --> 01:26:45,498
I couldn't breathe in my other dress!

1439
01:26:45,606 --> 01:26:48,665
A bride should be able to breathe in her own fucking dress!

1440
01:26:48,775 --> 01:26:52,974
Sorry, I just am feeling really stressed out right now

1441
01:26:53,080 --> 01:26:56,913
because I don't know how I'm going to convince Mom

1442
01:26:57,050 --> 01:26:58,677
to come to my wedding,

1443
01:26:58,785 --> 01:27:01,810
because our dad is bringing our new mommy,

1444
01:27:01,920 --> 01:27:03,217
- and she's not... - Stop.

1445
01:27:03,322 --> 01:27:07,917
I will go with you to talk to Mom, and you don't even have to trick me. Okay?

1446
01:27:08,025 --> 01:27:11,255
Now, are you sure you can breathe in this dress?

1447
01:27:12,995 --> 01:27:14,690
Okay, then do that.

1448
01:27:17,299 --> 01:27:18,789
It's really not gonna be that bad.

1449
01:27:18,900 --> 01:27:21,129
We're gonna loosen her up. We're gonna ease into it.

1450
01:27:21,235 --> 01:27:22,727
It's gonna be great.

1451
01:27:22,838 --> 01:27:24,566
If you say so.

1452
01:27:25,573 --> 01:27:26,972
Mom?

1453
01:27:29,143 --> 01:27:30,474
I don't believe you!

1454
01:27:30,778 --> 01:27:33,305
When were you planning to tell me about all this?

1455
01:27:33,528 --> 01:27:34,421
Hmm?

1456
01:27:34,427 --> 01:27:37,623
- Uh... Now? - That's why we're here, Mom.

1457
01:27:37,729 --> 01:27:40,720
I have to read about it in a magazine?

1458
01:27:40,998 --> 01:27:42,693
You and Jake Adams.

1459
01:27:44,234 --> 01:27:45,462
Are you an item?

1460
01:27:47,137 --> 01:27:48,195
Yes?

1461
01:27:49,572 --> 01:27:51,267
Did you just squeal, Mom?

1462
01:27:51,540 --> 01:27:54,906
I don't know. I'm out of my body right now.

1463
01:27:55,545 --> 01:27:56,705
Is it serious?

1464
01:27:57,747 --> 01:27:59,976
It could be, but we're taking it slow.

1465
01:28:00,082 --> 01:28:01,912
Do you really have that luxury?

1466
01:28:02,016 --> 01:28:03,711
I want to make sure that it's right.

1467
01:28:03,885 --> 01:28:06,149
Oh, it doesn't get any more right than Jake Adams.

1468
01:28:06,254 --> 01:28:09,347
This is your life, Ally, don't get creative.

1469
01:28:09,456 --> 01:28:11,787
When I saw you two in that magazine,

1470
01:28:11,891 --> 01:28:14,518
I went and found some old photographs.

1471
01:28:15,660 --> 01:28:17,423
Just look at this.

1472
01:28:19,496 --> 01:28:21,464
I knew he was the one.

1473
01:28:21,565 --> 01:28:22,589
Aw.

1474
01:28:24,066 --> 01:28:27,764
Tell me, Ally, is he gonna be your date to the wedding?

1475
01:28:29,605 --> 01:28:31,004
Is he, Ally?

1476
01:28:35,877 --> 01:28:36,867
Yes.

1477
01:28:37,345 --> 01:28:38,403
Oh!

1478
01:28:39,213 --> 01:28:41,373
Oh, I got to get the seating chart.

1479
01:28:41,481 --> 01:28:43,745
So, you're still gonna come to the wedding,

1480
01:28:43,850 --> 01:28:45,613
even though Dad's gonna be there, too?

1481
01:28:45,717 --> 01:28:47,116
Of course, darling.

1482
01:28:47,252 --> 01:28:49,515
My baby only gets married once.

1483
01:28:49,755 --> 01:28:50,880
Right?

1484
01:28:52,223 --> 01:28:54,214
I am so proud of my girls.

1485
01:28:57,327 --> 01:28:59,488
Seating chart. Seating chart.

1486
01:28:59,596 --> 01:29:01,121
Where's the little seating chart?

1487
01:29:01,232 --> 01:29:03,096
Do we tell her about Jacinda?

1488
01:29:03,233 --> 01:29:05,860
No. I think we quit while we're ahead.

1489
01:29:06,435 --> 01:29:08,198
- Bye, Mom. - Bye, Mom.

1490
01:29:08,304 --> 01:29:09,272
What?

1491
01:29:09,839 --> 01:29:11,101
...and get you drunk

1492
01:29:11,207 --> 01:29:14,733
So I can have my wicked way with you

1493
01:29:15,342 --> 01:29:17,003
I'm just being honest

1494
01:29:17,109 --> 01:29:22,342
'Cause I know the other guys are thinking just the same way too

1495
01:29:25,417 --> 01:29:28,283
I really love Japan.

1496
01:29:28,385 --> 01:29:30,318
Really?

1497
01:29:33,091 --> 01:29:34,682
- Are those mini cheeseburgers? - Yes, they are.

1498
01:29:34,792 --> 01:29:36,521
May I? Thank you.

1499
01:29:38,027 --> 01:29:39,551
You didn't want one?

1500
01:29:39,729 --> 01:29:41,754
No, I'm okay. Thank you.

1501
01:29:42,565 --> 01:29:45,465
Mmm. These are excellent mini cheeseburgers.

1502
01:29:46,434 --> 01:29:48,664
- Thank you. Thank you. - Thank you.

1503
01:29:50,837 --> 01:29:53,670
Show me some skin I might bite it

1504
01:29:54,640 --> 01:29:58,576
I wanna have my wicked way with you

1505
01:30:02,614 --> 01:30:08,109
So I'm not gonna come over and meet your mom and dad

1506
01:30:08,219 --> 01:30:10,550
They know that I was bad

1507
01:30:10,754 --> 01:30:13,917
I'm just thinking of three hours or more

1508
01:30:14,057 --> 01:30:18,425
So I can have my wicked way with you

1509
01:30:19,929 --> 01:30:24,728
My wicked way with you

1510
01:30:31,838 --> 01:30:34,397
- Colin, hi. - Hi.

1511
01:30:35,841 --> 01:30:39,572
Fancy meeting you here, dressed all fancy.

1512
01:30:39,678 --> 01:30:41,009
Where you off to?

1513
01:30:42,147 --> 01:30:43,614
A wedding.

1514
01:30:43,715 --> 01:30:46,512
You, too, right? Today's Daisy's big day.

1515
01:30:47,585 --> 01:30:49,415
Yeah.

1516
01:30:49,519 --> 01:30:53,546
Wow. You're going to a wedding, too. That's weird.

1517
01:30:53,656 --> 01:30:54,680
Whose wedding?

1518
01:30:56,792 --> 01:30:58,452
Nobody you know.

1519
01:30:58,760 --> 01:30:59,886
Oh.

1520
01:31:01,394 --> 01:31:04,796
Is it like a date or something? Are you seeing somebody?

1521
01:31:07,166 --> 01:31:09,224
Don't worry about it, Ally.

1522
01:31:16,309 --> 01:31:18,572
Don't drink too much champagne.

1523
01:31:44,664 --> 01:31:46,495
Hey, is my hair too high?

1524
01:31:46,600 --> 01:31:47,930
Oh, no, honey. It's perfect.

1525
01:31:48,033 --> 01:31:50,091
- Is it going on? - The dress doesn't fit.

1526
01:31:50,201 --> 01:31:51,760
- Okay. - Why isn't it zipped?

1527
01:31:51,870 --> 01:31:53,496
Can I get some help here?

1528
01:31:53,606 --> 01:31:55,835
Where's my Croissan' Wich?

1529
01:31:55,940 --> 01:31:57,271
Did somebody eat my Croissan' Wich?

1530
01:31:57,375 --> 01:31:59,706
No, honey. Nobody did. You just relax, okay?

1531
01:31:59,809 --> 01:32:01,299
Katie, Jamie, find Daisy's Croissan' Wich.

1532
01:32:01,410 --> 01:32:03,070
- Okay. On it. - Got it. Okay.

1533
01:32:04,013 --> 01:32:05,105
Okay, listen,

1534
01:32:05,213 --> 01:32:07,511
- I don't want anyone to panic but... - What's happening?

1535
01:32:07,616 --> 01:32:09,708
- The harpist isn't coming. - I had a harpist?

1536
01:32:09,818 --> 01:32:12,251
She broke her finger during the philharmonic softball league playoffs,

1537
01:32:12,353 --> 01:32:14,753
and given that this is one of the busiest wedding weekends of the year,

1538
01:32:14,855 --> 01:32:15,948
all the other harpists are booked.

1539
01:32:16,391 --> 01:32:18,086
Oh, Christ. Why is this happening to me?

1540
01:32:18,192 --> 01:32:20,386
I got a list of all the other weddings happening in the city

1541
01:32:20,493 --> 01:32:23,291
and found a replacement who can be here as soon as her first wedding is over.

1542
01:32:23,429 --> 01:32:26,398
And if she doesn't show, I play the horn.

1543
01:32:27,132 --> 01:32:28,793
Now let's get this girl married, huh?

1544
01:32:30,534 --> 01:32:32,024
Daise, I got it.

1545
01:32:56,623 --> 01:32:59,091
Please rise for the bride.

1546
01:33:07,164 --> 01:33:09,188
We are gathered here today to celebrate the union

1547
01:33:09,298 --> 01:33:12,028
of Daisy Ann Darling and Edward Michael Vogel.

1548
01:33:12,669 --> 01:33:16,229
Getting to know Daisy and Eddie has reinforced my belief that,

1549
01:33:16,338 --> 01:33:17,895
while love is universal,

1550
01:33:18,005 --> 01:33:20,200
every couple is unique.

1551
01:33:27,248 --> 01:33:30,547
Daisy Darling, today I make these vows to you.

1552
01:33:31,419 --> 01:33:33,386
I will never rhyme "crazy" with "Daisy,"

1553
01:33:35,320 --> 01:33:37,652
Even if I mean, like, "crazy good".

1554
01:33:38,257 --> 01:33:40,486
I will not blow my nose in the shower.

1555
01:33:42,660 --> 01:33:46,220
I promise to always consult you before getting a haircut

1556
01:33:46,329 --> 01:33:47,762
and to never grow a mustache.

1557
01:33:49,099 --> 01:33:50,530
- Or a soul patch. - No.

1558
01:33:54,371 --> 01:33:57,601
I will not blame you for the bad decisions you make in my dreams.

1559
01:34:01,643 --> 01:34:07,410
I will keep an eye on that suspicious freckle on your back,

1560
01:34:07,514 --> 01:34:10,243
even though I'm really sure it's nothing.

1561
01:34:11,149 --> 01:34:15,847
And I will not get mad at you about everything

1562
01:34:16,821 --> 01:34:20,279
when I'm only really mad at you about one thing.

1563
01:34:24,426 --> 01:34:25,690
By the power vested in me,

1564
01:34:25,796 --> 01:34:28,025
I am happy to pronounce you husband and wife.

1565
01:34:28,132 --> 01:34:29,620
You may kiss the bride.

1566
01:34:31,200 --> 01:34:37,604
I'm holding a heart here in my hand

1567
01:34:37,705 --> 01:34:42,835
Hey, hey, hey

1568
01:34:43,410 --> 01:34:48,368
My own work of art

1569
01:34:48,480 --> 01:34:50,949
Here where I stand

1570
01:34:51,050 --> 01:34:56,281
Hey, hey, hey

1571
01:35:03,259 --> 01:35:07,719
I can see clearly now The rain is gone

1572
01:35:11,032 --> 01:35:14,296
I can see all obstacles in my way

1573
01:35:14,435 --> 01:35:16,425
- Quite a party. - Yeah, it sure is.

1574
01:35:16,536 --> 01:35:18,902
Hold on. I have to tweet about this.

1575
01:35:19,005 --> 01:35:20,995
And hi there.

1576
01:35:25,310 --> 01:35:27,641
Your mom always did have a great laugh.

1577
01:35:27,779 --> 01:35:30,009
I'm just glad she's happy.

1578
01:35:30,114 --> 01:35:31,878
Are you happy?

1579
01:35:31,984 --> 01:35:33,780
Yeah. Of course.

1580
01:35:39,791 --> 01:35:41,758
Your mom only wants what's best for you, you know.

1581
01:35:41,858 --> 01:35:42,846
I know.

1582
01:35:42,959 --> 01:35:46,257
Unfortunately, she thinks what's best for you is being exactly like her,

1583
01:35:46,362 --> 01:35:47,419
only you're not, Ally.

1584
01:35:47,528 --> 01:35:50,588
You may have her looks, but you have my rhythm, kid.

1585
01:35:50,697 --> 01:35:52,493
I'm afraid it's a little offbeat.

1586
01:35:54,099 --> 01:35:57,069
I guess that explains why she's always disappointed in me.

1587
01:35:57,402 --> 01:36:00,269
I think it's hard for her to look at you and see so much of me.

1588
01:36:05,443 --> 01:36:09,038
Thanks for the time

1589
01:36:09,480 --> 01:36:11,277
That you've given me

1590
01:36:11,382 --> 01:36:13,441
Uh, may I?

1591
01:36:14,318 --> 01:36:15,649
Why not?

1592
01:36:15,752 --> 01:36:17,912
Thank you. Thank you, sir.

1593
01:36:20,789 --> 01:36:23,120
God, I'm sorry. I just couldn't slow-dance with your mother.

1594
01:36:23,224 --> 01:36:25,453
No, that's okay.

1595
01:36:27,661 --> 01:36:30,925
I think the last time we slow-danced was prom night.

1596
01:36:31,030 --> 01:36:33,692
Yeah. Yeah, it was. I remember that.

1597
01:36:33,799 --> 01:36:37,360
I believe that was also the night where you finally gave me the honor

1598
01:36:37,469 --> 01:36:40,904
of making you unfit for every other man in the village.

1599
01:36:42,707 --> 01:36:44,231
Oh, boy.

1600
01:36:44,342 --> 01:36:47,708
You're once, twice

1601
01:36:49,913 --> 01:36:53,075
Three times a lady

1602
01:36:53,182 --> 01:36:56,708
I know this isn't the ideal place to tell you, but I want to be honest.

1603
01:36:56,818 --> 01:36:58,307
You weren't my first.

1604
01:36:59,386 --> 01:37:00,683
I wasn't?

1605
01:37:00,788 --> 01:37:02,684
No, I'm sorry.

1606
01:37:02,790 --> 01:37:07,282
Well, so you've been with two guys in your life. Big deal.

1607
01:37:08,962 --> 01:37:11,123
More like two times 10.

1608
01:37:11,931 --> 01:37:17,027
Right. Like you've had sex with 20 guys. Yuck.

1609
01:37:18,736 --> 01:37:20,260
Gross.

1610
01:37:23,039 --> 01:37:28,601
Well, all right. I may not have been your first, but maybe I'll be your last.

1611
01:37:29,378 --> 01:37:31,470
Why? Are you gonna rape and kill me?

1612
01:37:31,578 --> 01:37:33,877
No, but I'm gonna kiss you.

1613
01:37:35,149 --> 01:37:38,379
With every beat

1614
01:37:38,485 --> 01:37:43,480
Of my heart

1615
01:37:44,291 --> 01:37:45,417
You're once

1616
01:37:45,525 --> 01:37:46,786
Come with me for a second.

1617
01:37:46,893 --> 01:37:48,258
Twice

1618
01:37:50,062 --> 01:37:52,586
Three times a lady

1619
01:37:53,899 --> 01:37:58,925
So, how does dinner in Milan and breakfast in Paris sound?

1620
01:37:59,035 --> 01:38:00,366
Starchy.

1621
01:38:00,470 --> 01:38:02,437
I've got to do a little traveling for the foundation,

1622
01:38:02,537 --> 01:38:03,970
and I'd love it if you came with me.

1623
01:38:05,474 --> 01:38:07,032
- Seriously? - Mmm-hmm.

1624
01:38:07,709 --> 01:38:10,040
- For how long? - Six months.

1625
01:38:10,144 --> 01:38:12,839
I know it sounds like a long time, but you're in-between jobs

1626
01:38:12,946 --> 01:38:16,644
and your little sculpture things can wait.

1627
01:38:16,918 --> 01:38:19,647
And if you think about it, the only thing that's keeping you in Boston is me,

1628
01:38:19,753 --> 01:38:21,380
and I'm leaving.

1629
01:38:23,323 --> 01:38:24,721
It's time.

1630
01:38:27,293 --> 01:38:28,783
Excuse me.

1631
01:38:31,662 --> 01:38:32,720
Thank you.

1632
01:38:32,829 --> 01:38:39,358
And I love you

1633
01:38:43,404 --> 01:38:44,894
Join me.

1634
01:38:45,472 --> 01:38:46,839
Hi, everyone.

1635
01:38:46,943 --> 01:38:48,671
Hi.

1636
01:38:50,011 --> 01:38:52,740
When Daisy and Eddie first got together,

1637
01:38:52,846 --> 01:38:55,838
I have to admit I was a little bit nervous.

1638
01:38:56,617 --> 01:38:58,481
I could tell that it was serious,

1639
01:38:58,584 --> 01:39:01,746
and I thought that the closer she got to him,

1640
01:39:01,853 --> 01:39:04,548
the further away she'd get from me,

1641
01:39:04,656 --> 01:39:07,088
but that didn't happen.

1642
01:39:09,092 --> 01:39:11,617
Not only do I see more of Daisy,

1643
01:39:11,728 --> 01:39:14,855
I see a happier, even better Daisy.

1644
01:39:19,869 --> 01:39:21,802
It's like with Eddie she's

1645
01:39:25,472 --> 01:39:26,804
completely herself.

1646
01:39:44,088 --> 01:39:48,820
When you're a big sister, it's your job to teach your little sister everything.

1647
01:39:50,092 --> 01:39:52,085
How to ride a bike,

1648
01:39:52,695 --> 01:39:54,595
how to lie to your parents.

1649
01:39:55,298 --> 01:39:56,286
How to kiss.

1650
01:39:56,398 --> 01:39:58,092
Not with tongue. Settle down, Uncle Charlie.

1651
01:40:02,037 --> 01:40:04,436
But I never thought

1652
01:40:06,507 --> 01:40:09,805
about what my little sister could teach me until right now.

1653
01:40:11,009 --> 01:40:13,409
So, I want to thank you, Daisy.

1654
01:40:14,012 --> 01:40:16,742
Thank you for teaching me

1655
01:40:18,648 --> 01:40:22,641
that being in love means being yourself.

1656
01:40:27,524 --> 01:40:28,990
To Daisy and Eddie!

1657
01:40:35,163 --> 01:40:36,630
- You were great. - Can we talk?

1658
01:40:36,765 --> 01:40:38,527
Yeah. Absolutely.

1659
01:40:41,768 --> 01:40:43,497
That's the way, uh-huh, uh-huh

1660
01:40:43,635 --> 01:40:45,899
I like it, uh-huh, uh-huh

1661
01:40:46,004 --> 01:40:47,733
That's the way, uh-huh, uh-huh

1662
01:40:47,839 --> 01:40:49,830
I like it, uh-huh, uh-huh

1663
01:40:50,041 --> 01:40:51,804
That's the way, uh-huh, uh-huh

1664
01:40:51,910 --> 01:40:53,206
Oh, shit.

1665
01:40:55,045 --> 01:40:57,242
What's going on? Are you okay?

1666
01:41:00,284 --> 01:41:05,812
Jake, there actually is something here in Boston that's really important to me.

1667
01:41:06,256 --> 01:41:10,316
And as much as I want to travel the world,

1668
01:41:10,426 --> 01:41:12,949
I'm not sure I want to do it with you.

1669
01:41:13,061 --> 01:41:16,119
Which is insane, I know, because you're perfect.

1670
01:41:17,163 --> 01:41:19,426
But you're not perfect for me,

1671
01:41:19,531 --> 01:41:22,762
and I don't think I'm perfect for you.

1672
01:41:24,035 --> 01:41:26,265
I'm so sorry, Jake.

1673
01:41:26,371 --> 01:41:29,364
If I had been honest with myself earlier,

1674
01:41:29,475 --> 01:41:31,339
or ever,

1675
01:41:31,443 --> 01:41:33,308
I wouldn't have put you through all this.

1676
01:41:33,444 --> 01:41:36,311
Yeah, well, that would have been preferable.

1677
01:41:37,781 --> 01:41:40,613
Right. I don't think I'm gonna stick around for the cake. Excuse me.

1678
01:41:41,984 --> 01:41:43,575
It's really good.

1679
01:41:58,630 --> 01:42:00,096
Okay.

1680
01:42:05,471 --> 01:42:07,904
Where's... Where's Jake going?

1681
01:42:08,072 --> 01:42:10,472
- Sir, champagne? - He's leaving.

1682
01:42:10,575 --> 01:42:13,668
What? In the middle of the reception? Why?

1683
01:42:13,777 --> 01:42:16,438
Because I never should have brought him here in the first place.

1684
01:42:17,279 --> 01:42:20,076
You're gonna let him go?

1685
01:42:20,181 --> 01:42:22,808
Oh, Ally, I... I don't understand you.

1686
01:42:23,017 --> 01:42:25,780
Ally, why? Why are you doing this?

1687
01:42:25,886 --> 01:42:28,480
Honey, you were finally happy.

1688
01:42:28,589 --> 01:42:31,988
No! You were finally happy.

1689
01:42:32,090 --> 01:42:34,060
I don't wanna marry Jake Adams.

1690
01:42:34,193 --> 01:42:36,025
- That's not who I am. - Oh, my...

1691
01:42:36,130 --> 01:42:39,428
I'm a jobless whore who's slept with 20 guys,

1692
01:42:39,532 --> 01:42:42,864
and I want to be with somebody who appreciates that about me.

1693
01:42:44,068 --> 01:42:46,969
You may not understand me, Mom, but you don't have to.

1694
01:42:47,771 --> 01:42:49,431
All you have to do is love me.

1695
01:42:51,974 --> 01:42:55,637
I know that I'm not perfect, but that's why you have Daisy.

1696
01:42:55,744 --> 01:42:58,211
My dress is too tight because I'm four months pregnant.

1697
01:43:01,215 --> 01:43:03,647
- What? - What?

1698
01:43:03,884 --> 01:43:05,180
Oh!

1699
01:43:07,321 --> 01:43:08,378
You're pregnant?

1700
01:43:08,822 --> 01:43:10,847
Yes. Now get out of here.

1701
01:43:10,957 --> 01:43:12,856
Thank you.

1702
01:43:12,958 --> 01:43:13,982
Surprise!

1703
01:43:14,093 --> 01:43:18,290
I'm gonna be a grandmother. I'm gonna be a grandmother.

1704
01:43:23,267 --> 01:43:24,699
All the drinks are sitting here on your tray.

1705
01:43:24,800 --> 01:43:26,097
What is the matter with you? Is this too difficult?

1706
01:43:26,201 --> 01:43:27,828
Kevin, where's that list you had of all the other weddings

1707
01:43:27,936 --> 01:43:29,267
- going on in the city today? - It's right here.

1708
01:43:29,371 --> 01:43:30,395
Okay, thank you.

1709
01:43:40,861 --> 01:43:44,490
Goddamn. Damn it!

1710
01:44:02,445 --> 01:44:03,434
Hi.

1711
01:44:03,546 --> 01:44:04,774
Every time I think of you

1712
01:44:04,880 --> 01:44:09,009
I feel shot right through with a bolt of blue

1713
01:44:09,117 --> 01:44:13,451
It's no problem of mine But it's a problem I find

1714
01:44:13,555 --> 01:44:15,078
Living a life that I can't leave behind

1715
01:44:17,958 --> 01:44:21,291
But there's no sense in telling me

1716
01:44:21,428 --> 01:44:22,894
The wisdom of the fool won't set you free

1717
01:44:25,164 --> 01:44:26,960
But that's the way that it goes

1718
01:44:27,065 --> 01:44:29,225
And it's what nobody knows

1719
01:44:29,467 --> 01:44:33,301
Well, every day my confusion grows

1720
01:44:33,770 --> 01:44:37,206
Every time I see you falling

1721
01:44:37,574 --> 01:44:41,339
I get down on my knees and pray

1722
01:44:41,510 --> 01:44:45,571
I'm waiting for that final moment

1723
01:44:46,249 --> 01:44:47,215
Colin!

1724
01:44:58,491 --> 01:45:01,618
I feel fine and I feel good

1725
01:45:02,394 --> 01:45:05,362
I feel like I never should

1726
01:45:05,529 --> 01:45:09,260
Whenever I get this way I just don't know what to say

1727
01:45:09,366 --> 01:45:14,029
Why can't we be ourselves like we were yesterday?

1728
01:45:14,203 --> 01:45:17,640
Every time I see you falling

1729
01:45:18,007 --> 01:45:21,772
I get down on my knees and pray

1730
01:45:21,944 --> 01:45:26,004
I'm waiting for that final moment

1731
01:45:26,114 --> 01:45:29,674
You say the words that I can't say

1732
01:45:35,587 --> 01:45:37,577
Oh, come on!

1733
01:45:39,056 --> 01:45:42,821
Blessed be this union and may it bear fruit.

1734
01:46:09,382 --> 01:46:12,009
Colin! Colin!

1735
01:46:21,393 --> 01:46:23,360
Blue car, keys are in it.

1736
01:46:46,746 --> 01:46:48,235
Get the fuck outta the road!

1737
01:46:48,881 --> 01:46:49,939
Hey, watch it, lady.

1738
01:46:50,348 --> 01:46:52,247
Shut up, you asshole!

1739
01:46:55,187 --> 01:46:57,347
Sorry! I'm sorry!

1740
01:46:57,922 --> 01:46:59,252
I'm sorry!

1741
01:47:13,701 --> 01:47:14,725
Thank you.

1742
01:47:14,835 --> 01:47:17,701
You can help yourself to some pepperoni.

1743
01:47:23,908 --> 01:47:24,966
Miss, your name?

1744
01:47:27,313 --> 01:47:28,438
Uh...

1745
01:47:29,314 --> 01:47:30,302
I...

1746
01:47:35,753 --> 01:47:37,879
I'm... I'm sorry.

1747
01:47:38,689 --> 01:47:41,451
Hi, everyone. Hope you're all having a good time tonight. I know we are.

1748
01:47:42,291 --> 01:47:45,817
This next song is a local band. Hope you enjoy it.

1749
01:47:52,699 --> 01:47:54,929
I don't mind you coming here

1750
01:47:56,368 --> 01:47:58,359
And wasting all my time

1751
01:48:00,157 --> 01:48:02,680
'Cause when you're standing oh, so near

1752
01:48:03,958 --> 01:48:05,550
I kind of lose my mind

1753
01:48:06,059 --> 01:48:07,357
This is bullshit.

1754
01:48:07,461 --> 01:48:10,021
Why didn't I just wait for him at his apartment?

1755
01:48:10,931 --> 01:48:13,763
And wasting all my time

1756
01:48:16,502 --> 01:48:17,490
Fuck!

1757
01:48:18,303 --> 01:48:19,361
Fuck!

1758
01:48:19,470 --> 01:48:20,869
- Fuck! - Fuck!

1759
01:48:22,238 --> 01:48:25,639
I don't mind you hanging out

1760
01:48:25,742 --> 01:48:27,902
And talking in your sleep

1761
01:48:29,445 --> 01:48:32,141
It doesn't matter where you've been

1762
01:48:33,016 --> 01:48:35,779
As long as it was deep Yeah

1763
01:48:36,985 --> 01:48:40,284
Always need to wear it well

1764
01:48:40,389 --> 01:48:42,652
You look so fancy, I can tell

1765
01:48:45,426 --> 01:48:46,687
I don't mind you hanging out

1766
01:48:47,994 --> 01:48:50,086
And talking in your sleep

1767
01:48:51,930 --> 01:48:55,695
I guess you're just what I needed

1768
01:48:55,800 --> 01:48:57,734
I needed someone to feed

1769
01:48:57,835 --> 01:48:59,495
Someone to...

1770
01:48:59,602 --> 01:49:01,570
I need to talk to you

1771
01:49:02,705 --> 01:49:05,301
- Right now - I needed someone to feed

1772
01:49:08,911 --> 01:49:11,003
Cut. Cut. Cut. Cut.

1773
01:49:13,349 --> 01:49:15,578
Okay, everybody, we're just gonna take a quick break.

1774
01:49:15,683 --> 01:49:18,015
Why don't we get those toasts started?

1775
01:49:18,119 --> 01:49:21,178
So, papa bear, come on up here.

1776
01:49:27,291 --> 01:49:30,090
Hello, everyone, and thank you all for coming out tonight...

1777
01:49:30,195 --> 01:49:34,358
Fuckity fuck! Fuckity fuck! Fuckity fuck!

1778
01:49:36,935 --> 01:49:38,926
What're you doing here, Ally?

1779
01:49:39,037 --> 01:49:40,560
I have a speech that I wanna make to you,

1780
01:49:40,671 --> 01:49:42,763
but I was afraid that I was gonna forget it.

1781
01:49:42,872 --> 01:49:47,536
So, I figured it would be easier to drive, bike,

1782
01:49:47,643 --> 01:49:51,976
and run across town in my high heels so I could tell you right now.

1783
01:49:54,981 --> 01:49:56,607
What's the speech?

1784
01:49:59,785 --> 01:50:03,220
Well, the gist of it was,

1785
01:50:04,422 --> 01:50:05,719
I'm sorry.

1786
01:50:07,391 --> 01:50:09,987
- That's it? - No, wait, there's more.

1787
01:50:10,095 --> 01:50:11,391
I...

1788
01:50:13,564 --> 01:50:18,296
I'm happiest when I'm being myself, and I'm myself when I'm with you.

1789
01:50:18,402 --> 01:50:19,767
That was it.

1790
01:50:20,870 --> 01:50:23,804
I guess I was just so afraid that you were another asshole

1791
01:50:23,905 --> 01:50:26,772
that I became the biggest asshole of all.

1792
01:50:27,776 --> 01:50:30,208
You weren't an asshole. I was an asshole.

1793
01:50:30,309 --> 01:50:33,369
I should have given you Jake's number, I just...

1794
01:50:34,547 --> 01:50:36,515
I didn't think I could compete with that.

1795
01:50:38,750 --> 01:50:40,341
There's no contest.

1796
01:50:41,519 --> 01:50:44,081
You're the most decent guy I've ever met.

1797
01:50:56,365 --> 01:50:58,629
I think I love you, 21.

1798
01:51:01,536 --> 01:51:03,093
I love you, too.

1799
01:51:05,004 --> 01:51:06,632
- Three hundred and... - No!

1800
01:51:50,243 --> 01:51:53,643
Hey, Kelli, Kelli with an "I". What's up?

1801
01:51:53,744 --> 01:51:55,838
It's Jay from Club Med Turkoise.

1802
01:51:55,948 --> 01:51:58,313
I got a weird message from your assistant,

1803
01:51:58,416 --> 01:52:01,509
and I just wanted to let you know, we never had sex.

1804
01:52:01,618 --> 01:52:05,418
Uh, you did this awkward striptease involving maracas,

1805
01:52:05,522 --> 01:52:08,512
and then gave me a shitty hand job.

1806
01:52:08,624 --> 01:52:11,991
You claimed it was something you like to do called "dry style,"

1807
01:52:12,093 --> 01:52:15,584
vomited in my suitcase, and then you passed out in the shower.

1808
01:52:15,696 --> 01:52:17,959
So, yeah, we never slept together.

1809
01:52:22,870 --> 01:52:26,635
You're number 20! I'm still at 20!

1810
01:52:26,739 --> 01:52:31,141
I can't believe it! You are number 20!

1811
01:52:31,910 --> 01:52:33,241
Yes!

1812
01:52:35,945 --> 01:52:39,472
It will outlast everything You think is set is stone

1813
01:52:39,582 --> 01:52:41,742
It goes on and on and on and on

1814
01:52:41,850 --> 01:52:43,784
On and on and on and on

1815
01:52:43,919 --> 01:52:47,616
Buzzing like neon lights

1816
01:52:47,723 --> 01:52:49,849
Can you feel my love?

1817
01:52:49,957 --> 01:52:53,518
Loud and clear Pulls you near

1818
01:52:53,828 --> 01:52:56,058
Can you feel my love?

1819
01:52:57,197 --> 01:53:01,067
We got all the memories So much more we can see

1820
01:53:01,601 --> 01:53:05,195
Better than a first kiss Snow falling at Christmas

1821
01:53:05,303 --> 01:53:09,501
Like sleeping in on Sunday Laughter we never faked

1822
01:53:09,606 --> 01:53:13,633
Bob Marley in summer One love for each other

1823
01:53:13,810 --> 01:53:14,867
Oh, it feels like...

1824
01:53:15,010 --> 01:53:18,174
Fireflies Day and night

1825
01:53:18,480 --> 01:53:20,948
Can you feel my love?

1826
01:53:22,883 --> 01:53:26,878
Everyone is looking for a special connection

1827
01:53:26,988 --> 01:53:30,855
But it's like your compass points a million directions

1828
01:53:31,324 --> 01:53:34,988
Do you need me to buy you a telescope so you can see

1829
01:53:35,129 --> 01:53:38,359
How good this could be

1830
01:53:39,231 --> 01:53:42,791
Buzzing like neon lights

1831
01:53:43,101 --> 01:53:45,125
Can you feel my love?

1832
01:53:45,402 --> 01:53:48,963
Loud and clear Pulls you near

1833
01:53:49,272 --> 01:53:51,502
Can you feel my love?

1834
01:53:52,474 --> 01:53:56,603
We got all the memories So much more we can see

1835
01:53:56,711 --> 01:54:00,478
Better than a first kiss Snow falling at Christmas

1836
01:54:00,582 --> 01:54:04,780
Like sleeping in on Sunday Laughter we never faked

1837
01:54:04,886 --> 01:54:08,912
Bob Marley in summer One love for each other

1838
01:54:09,090 --> 01:54:10,147
Oh, it feels like...

1839
01:54:12,992 --> 01:54:15,460
One love for each other
