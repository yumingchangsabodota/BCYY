{\rE}I'll leave.

653
01:14:47,700 --> 01:14:49,700
等等
{\rE}Wait.

654
01:14:51,720 --> 01:14:54,720
你們知道所有得了拉曼拉病毒的人都會很快死去
{\rE}You all know what will happen to someone infected with Lamanla.

655
01:14:56,750 --> 01:14:58,750
我希望你們永遠記得
{\rE}I hope you'll always remember

656
01:14:59,770 --> 01:15:02,770
這將死的人救了你們所有人
{\rE}this dying man saved all of you.

657
01:15:02,790 --> 01:15:04,690
你真可恥
{\rE}Shame on you!

658
01:15:04,720 --> 01:15:06,720
你們所有人都可恥
{\rE}Shame on all of you!

659
01:15:58,770 --> 01:16:00,770
冷鋒
{\rE}Leng Feng!

660
01:16:00,790 --> 01:16:02,790
冷鋒
{\rE}Leng Feng!

661
01:16:02,810 --> 01:16:04,810
冷鋒
{\rE}Leng Feng!

662
01:16:36,740 --> 01:16:38,740
- 你開槍有多大把握 - 百分之五十
{\rE}- How confident are you with a gun? - So-50%

663
01:16:38,760 --> 01:16:41,760
在我這兒沒有那百分之五十
{\rE}There's no place in my team for so-50%.

664
01:16:43,690 --> 01:16:45,690
您是想讓我酒後吐真言呐
{\rE}Trying to get me drunk so I blurt out the truth?

665
01:16:45,710 --> 01:16:47,710
你會吐真言嗎?
{\rE}Will you blurt out the truth?

666
01:16:47,730 --> 01:16:49,730
會
{\rE}Certainly.

667
01:16:53,760 --> 01:16:55,760
你喝醉了啥樣?
{\rE}What are you like when you're drunk?

668
01:16:55,780 --> 01:16:57,780
我等你回來請我喝酒
{\rE}I'll let you buy me drinks when you come back.

669
01:17:03,710 --> 01:17:05,710
你沒回來
{\rE}You're the one who didn't come back.

670
01:17:09,730 --> 01:17:11,730
你回來
{\rE}Come back to bed.

671
01:17:11,750 --> 01:17:13,750
別鬧
{\rE}Cut it out.

672
01:17:22,680 --> 01:17:24,680
希望我回來的時候
{\rE}When I get back

673
01:17:24,700 --> 01:17:26,700
你能在這個檔上簽字
{\rE}this had better be signed.

674
01:17:40,730 --> 01:17:42,730
沖上去被打死很容易
{\rE}It's an easy death when you're on the attack.

675
01:17:44,750 --> 01:17:47,750
難的是背負著內疚和使命感繼續活下去
{\rE}but it's a hard life carrying a survivor's guilt.

676
01:17:56,770 --> 01:17:58,770
是你沒回來
{\rE}But you didn't come back.

677
01:17:59,700 --> 01:18:01,700
你沒回來
{\rE}It's you who didn't come back.

678
01:18:02,720 --> 01:18:04,720
你沒回來
{\rE}You didn't come back.

679
01:18:22,750 --> 01:18:24,750
到底是誰?
{\rE}Against who?

680
01:18:24,770 --> 01:18:26,770
昨天跟我們交的手
{\rE}Who were we fighting yesterday?

681
01:18:39,690 --> 01:18:41,690
你媽媽沒告訴你
{\rE}Didn't your mom tell you that

682
01:18:41,720 --> 01:18:43,720
小孩子不要玩槍嗎?
{\rE}you shouldn't play with a gun?

683
01:18:47,740 --> 01:18:49,740
冷
{\rE}Leng!

684
01:18:50,770 --> 01:18:52,770
就是冷 就是他一個人
{\rE}That was Leng, only him alone.

685
01:18:54,690 --> 01:18:56,690
是我
{\rE}It was me!

686
01:18:58,710 --> 01:19:01,710
我在這工作之前是個軍人
{\rE}I was in the military before I worked here.

687
01:19:01,740 --> 01:19:03,740
你看看其他人
{\rE}Does anyone here

688
01:19:03,760 --> 01:19:05,760
像會開槍射擊的樣子嗎?
{\rE}look like they can shoot?

689
01:19:05,790 --> 01:19:07,790
好啊
{\rE}Okay.

690
01:19:29,710 --> 01:19:31,710
你醒了
{\rE}You're up.

691
01:19:34,730 --> 01:19:37,730
可惜陳博士沒有看到這一幕
{\rE}It's a shame Dr. Chen didn't live to see this.

692
01:19:37,760 --> 01:19:40,760
他是全世界唯一發現自愈活體的專家
{\rE}He discovered the presence of self-healing properties in humans.

693
01:19:40,780 --> 01:19:44,680
陳博士發現有極少數人體內有抵抗拉曼拉的抗體
{\rE}In extreme rare cases, Lamanla antibodies can be found in patients.

694
01:19:44,710 --> 01:19:48,710
在他無數次和拉曼拉患者的治療過程中
{\rE}Among the thousands of Lamanla patients he treated

695
01:19:48,730 --> 01:19:50,730
他偶然發現了一個自愈活體的實例
{\rE}He chanced upon one such person

696
01:19:51,750 --> 01:19:53,750
而這個自愈活體就是帕莎
{\rE}And that person is Pasha.

697
01:19:54,680 --> 01:19:57,680
她不是陳博士的女兒 是他的病人
{\rE}So Pasha's not his daughter, but his patient.

698
01:19:57,700 --> 01:20:00,700
陳博士通過對帕莎血液成分的分析和萃取
{\rE}From the analysis of Pasha's blood

699
01:20:00,730 --> 01:20:03,730
剛剛研製出一種新藥
{\rE}he created an experimental vaccine.

700
01:20:03,750 --> 01:20:05,750
昨天晚上因為情況緊急
{\rE}Last night was a dire situation,

701
01:20:05,770 --> 01:20:08,770
我只能在你身上做了一個陳博士曾經設想
{\rE}so I experimented on you, what Dr. Chen was planning to do.

702
01:20:08,800 --> 01:20:11,700
但是還沒來得及做的活體實驗
{\rE}The first human trial that he was hoping for

703
01:20:11,720 --> 01:20:14,720
我把陳博士的新藥注射到了你的身上
{\rE}Injecting you with Dr. Chen's newly synthesized vaccine immunogens

704
01:20:15,750 --> 01:20:17,750
說實話
{\rE}Honestly speaking,

705
01:20:17,770 --> 01:20:19,770
那個時候我真不知道會發生什麼
{\rE}I didn't know what would happen.

706
01:20:22,690 --> 01:20:24,690
幸運的是
{\rE}Luckily

707
01:20:24,720 --> 01:20:26,720
上帝站在我們這邊
{\rE}God was on your side.

708
01:20:33,740 --> 01:20:38,740
這個國家人民看到政府對病毒的無能為力極度失望
{\rE}The population has lost faith in the government to contain the outbreak.

709
01:20:38,770 --> 01:20:40,770
所以 誰得到帕莎
{\rE}So, whoever takes Pasha

710
01:20:40,790 --> 01:20:42,690
誰就能輕易的掌控這個國家
{\rE}takes the country easily.

711
01:20:42,710 --> 01:20:45,710
怪不得反政府軍一直在追殺我們
{\rE}That explains why the rebel army is hot on our heels.

712
01:21:07,740 --> 01:21:10,740
我爸爸說十萬年前人類走出非洲
{\rE}My dad said man walked out of Africa 100.000 years ago.

713
01:21:10,760 --> 01:21:13,760
非洲是現代文明的搖籃
{\rE}Africa is the cradle of modern civilization.

714
01:21:13,790 --> 01:21:16,690
可是當自詡文明的人們再次來到非洲
{\rE}Yet when the "evolved, civilized" humans returned to this land,

715
01:21:16,710 --> 01:21:18,710
帶來的卻是苦難
{\rE}they brought along with them nothing but suffering,

716
01:21:18,730 --> 01:21:20,730
奴役 疾病和戰爭
{\rE}slavery, disease and war.

717
01:21:21,760 --> 01:21:25,760
韓國人 冰島人 斯拉夫人
{\rE}Koreans, Icelanders, Slavs,

718
01:21:25,780 --> 01:21:27,680
美國人
{\rE}Americans

719
01:21:27,710 --> 01:21:30,710
那些是中國人 他們都是來自世界各地的
{\rE}and over there are Chinese. People from all over the world,

720
01:21:30,730 --> 01:21:32,730
像我爸爸一樣的人
{\rE}people like my father.

721
01:21:33,750 --> 01:21:35,750
為了非洲
{\rE}For Africa

722
01:21:35,780 --> 01:21:38,680
他們付出了自己的青春
{\rE}they gave their best years.

723
01:21:38,700 --> 01:21:40,700
到最後
{\rE}In the end,

724
01:21:40,730 --> 01:21:43,730
把自己永遠地留在這片土地
{\rE}they got to remain here for eternity.

725
01:21:54,750 --> 01:21:56,750
她叫什麼名字
{\rE}What's her name?

726
01:21:56,770 --> 01:21:58,770
嗯?

727
01:21:58,800 --> 01:22:00,800
那個你忘不了的人
{\rE}The person you can't seem to forget.

728
01:22:04,720 --> 01:22:06,720
龍小雲
{\rE}Long XiaoYun.

729
01:22:09,750 --> 01:22:11,750
她好幸運
{\rE}She's lucky

730
01:22:12,770 --> 01:22:14,770
有一個這麼愛她的男人
{\rE}to have a man that loves her so much.

731
01:22:15,690 --> 01:22:17,690
她為什麼沒有回來呢?
{\rE}Why didn't she come back?

732
01:22:28,720 --> 01:22:30,720
對不起
{\rE}Sorry.

733
01:22:49,740 --> 01:22:52,740
把他們當作餃子給我包起來 讓他們以為是安全的 明白嗎?
{\rE}I want you to round 'em up like cattle. Make 'em feel safe. You understand me?

734
01:22:52,770 --> 01:22:54,770

{\rE}Yes, sir.

735
01:23:04,690 --> 01:23:06,690
東邊是山區

736
01:23:06,710 --> 01:23:10,710
西邊是雨林 如果他夠聰明 就會來這等直升機
{\rE}we got forests to the east. The only smart place for them to come is right here and wait for the rescue helicopter.

737
01:23:11,740 --> 01:23:13,740
中國佬 你可別死
{\rE}I sure hope these Chinese people don't die.

738
01:23:14,760 --> 01:23:16,760
能救你的只有我了
{\rE}I'm about the only thing that can save them right now.

等我他媽出去了
{\rE}Wait till I get out of here,

742
01:23:44,760 --> 01:23:46,760
我他媽絕對不會放過這幫孫子
{\rE}I'm going to settle the score with them.

743
01:23:47,680 --> 01:23:49,680
凡哥
{\rE}Brother Fan,

744
01:23:49,710 --> 01:23:51,710
別他媽吹牛逼了

{\rE}In battle, no one will be giving in to us.

751

752

去死吧

哥 撐得住嗎?

比以前差遠了
{\rE}Not as well as back in the day.

755
01:25:53,770 --> 01:25:56,770
你的手是用來救人的 不是用來殺人的
{\rE}Your hands are for saving lives not taking lives.

756
01:26:14,690 --> 01:26:16,690
這種仗戰狼會怎麼打

757
01:27:00,720 --> 01:27:02,720
